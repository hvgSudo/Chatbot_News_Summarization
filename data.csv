Kevin Magnussen qualified 15th for Haas but will start 19th as he has a five-place penalty for taking his sixth engine of the season. Mick Schumacher had a time deleted in Q1 and finished 16th, with the same time as Aston Martin’s Sebastian Vettel in P17 – having set his time after the Haas. Lance Stroll, who qualified 18th for Aston Martin, is set to start 20th as he has a three-place penalty after a collision with Alonso in Austin. Alex Albon and Nicholas Latifi, who rounded out the standings in that order for Williams, will therefore be promoted two places apiece for Sunday’s race. Qualifying Highlights: 2022 Mexico City Grand Prix Q1 – Hamilton fastest over Verstappen Though there was a 60% risk of rain for qualifying, temperatures were high and the clouds were scattered above Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez in Q1. Williams and Haas – whose driver Magnussen has a five-place grid penalty having taken his sixth engine – began their runs first, the rest of the field waiting a minute or two to hit the track. Verstappen’s first run was compromised by oversteer into Turns 1 and 2 but he set the early benchmark with a time of 1m 19.222s, fastest in Sector 3, to go 0.283s faster than Leclerc, who was another 0.018s faster than Bottas – the Finn in turn 0.004s faster than Hamilton, who lost time in Sector 3. In the provisional drop zone was Schumacher in 16th, leading Albon, then Vettel, Magnussen and Latifi. Schumacher improved with three minutes left but his lap was chalked off for track limits at Turn 2. There was plenty of margin left on the table but neither Ferrari emerged for a final run, while Verstappen and Perez – who had to set a second flying lap with four minutes remaining – also declined another go. Hamilton shot to the top thereafter, bumping Verstappen to second by 0.053s, while Leclerc ended up third ahead of Bottas. Sainz rounded out the top five ahead of Russell and Perez settled for seventh, almost half a second off his team mate. Hamilton's final run saw him go top in Q1 With a big hit of the kerbs at Turn 10, Norris took eighth, Tsunoda ninth, and then Ocon rounded out the top 10 ahead of Alpine team mate Alonso. Gasly, Ricciardo, Zhou and Magnussen made it to Q2 – but Schumacher missed out on his 15th-place team mate by 0.126s. Vettel set the same time as Schumacher, just later than his compatriot, for 17th, while Aston Martin team mate Stroll – who has a three-place penalty for his Austin collision with Alonso – took 18th. A baffled Albon took 19th for Williams, and Latifi rounded out the standings. Knocked out: Schumacher, Vettel, Stroll, Albon, Latifi Vettel set the same time as Schumacher in Q1 – but both drivers were eliminated Q2 – Just 0.014s splits the top four as Hamilton leads again Having headed the previous session, Hamilton led Russell out for Q2 as Mercedes got the session under way. With a time of 1m 18.552s, Hamilton set the fastest time early on with Russell – who relayed on the radio that he was worried about his brakes – 0.013s behind and Bottas another two-tenths off in P3. Verstappen, meanwhile, was 0.382s off the pace with his first run, taking P4 ahead of Ocon. A huge tow on the front straight saw Leclerc begin his lap with an advantage, but he lost time in Sector 2 and ended up 0.557s off the pace in P6. With three minutes left, Perez – who was sitting 12th – once again emerged on a clear track and this time he found more than a second. Ricciardo, Tsunoda, Zhou, Gasly and Magnussen were in the drop zone, but the final runs were incoming. Hamilton retained top spot but Sainz improved to go 0.008s off the Mercedes, Russell keeping third as he suffered a front-right lock-up on his final run, and Verstappen going 0.001s behind the Briton in P4, leaving Perez fifth – just 0.063s off the pace. Bottas therefore ended up sixth, ahead of Ocon then Leclerc, who had aborted his final run despite setting a fastest Sector 2. In ninth was Norris, and in 10th was Alonso – leaving Ricciardo 11th by a margin of 0.053s to the two-time champion ahead. Zhou qualified 12th ahead of AlphaTauri drivers Tsunoda – unhappy with his track position – and Gasly, while Magnussen qualified 15th before his five-place penalty kicked in. Knocked out: Ricciardo, Zhou, Tsunoda, Gasly, Magnussen Verstappen wasn't far off the pace in Q2 – but Hamilton was fastest Q3 – Verstappen storms to pole as Mercedes fumble Mercedes held the cards going into Q3 but there was evidently a three-team fight for pole on the table. Perez began the shootout, packed-out Foro Sol grandstands emitting a goosebump-inducing roar for their home driver as he set a time of 1m 18.153s. Perez would drop down to third after Verstappen eclipsed him by two-tenths, Russell going a provisional second by 0.132s and Hamilton P3 by 0.147s – before track limits at Turn 3 cost him that flying lap. Worries compounded for Hamilton as he reported drivability issues soon after. Sainz, then Bottas, rounded out the top five. The Mexican driver went out first once again, followed closely by his rivals, but could not improve beyond P3. He had time for another run. Verstappen meanwhile improved to a 1m 17.775s, and Russell had his final time chalked off to finish 0.304s off the champion’s pace. Hamilton couldn’t sweep the sessions and for the 11th-straight year, there would be a different pole-sitter at the Mexican Grand Prix: Verstappen’s time would not be toppled. Later admitting his final effort was a “terrible lap”, Russell ended up second on the grid, however, and Hamilton third – just 0.005s off his team mate. Bottas starred throughout qualifying Perez settled for fourth, but was backed to recover by his team mate as the crowd cheered for the Mexican long after the chequered flag flew, while Sainz rounded out the top five, more than half a second off the pace. Bottas took P6 to split the Ferraris in a stunning performance for Alfa Romeo, while Leclerc settled for seventh, 0.780s off pole. That left Norris in eighth, with Alpine’s Alonso ninth and Ocon rounding out the top 10. Verstappen now holds the advantage, but not since 2016 has the pole-sitter won in Mexico City.

STRATEGY GUIDE: What are the possible race strategies for the 2022 Mexico City Grand Prix?, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.strategy-guide-what-are-the-possible-race-strategies-for-the-2022-mexico.iwBXK5vp0itVJpwUJlwaM.html, So here are some of the different options that are available to the teams on race day in Mexico City… What’s the quickest strategy? But the quickest is the one available to the top three teams, which is a two-stop strategy. Crucial to this strategy is how the soft tyres hold up in the first stint, with some pace management needed to protect them from too much wear. If a driver can extend that first stint to Lap 40 on the medium tyre, then doing the latter part of the race on the softs is possible. There’s also a two-stop strategy that can be considered by teams that don’t have two sets of mediums, but traffic will be the main concern., There’s a slightly different look to the grid this weekend in Mexico and tricky conditions for the drivers to tackle even if it remains dry and sunny, due to the altitude. So here are some of the different options that are available to the teams on race day in Mexico City… What’s the quickest strategy? In what is often the recipe for an exciting strategic race, there are two options that stand out that are closely-matched in terms of time, and they are of differing numbers of pit stops. But the quickest is the one available to the top three teams, which is a two-stop strategy. READ MORE: Verstappen fends off Mercedes pair for maiden Mexico City pole The key to this strategy is having two sets of medium tyres available – something Red Bull, Mercedes, Ferrari, Williams and Haas all have – allowing them to run two stints on this compound as it’s deemed the best race tyre. A run of over 800 metres from pole position to the braking zone for Turn 1 makes the launch off the line particularly crucial, and is likely to see many of the above teams opting for the soft compound to try and either protect their position or gain places. The first pit window would then be between Lap 16 and Lap 22, switching to mediums until between Lap 42 and 48, and then another set of mediums to the end of the race. Crucial to this strategy is how the soft tyres hold up in the first stint, with some pace management needed to protect them from too much wear. Graining hasn’t been a major issue but could be a factor if there’s cloud cover that makes track temperatures lower, but at the same time that still makes the soft the better tyre to be on for warm-up reasons. How about a different option for the top 10? For those without two sets of mediums available – Valtteri Bottas in seventh being the highest-place driver – then a one-stopper is not much slower than the two-stop above. The downside is starting on the mediums, giving up a bit of performance off the line compared to the soft, but then being able to run a much longer opening stint and not have to worry about pitting early into traffic. READ MORE: Mercedes in the hunt and Bottas between the Ferraris – What To Watch For in the Mexico City GP The medium tyre has been consistent and close to a second per lap quicker than the hard compound (though that delta often reduces in race trim when drivers aren’t pushing flat out at all times), so the aim will be a first stint of at least 28 laps. If the pit stop comes before Lap 35, then the hard compound is the more likely option for the second part of the race, especially for teams that are able to switch the tyre on. The hard is still a consistent tyre but does lack performance in the middle sector with high-speed changes of direction, and can be tough to warm-up. If a driver can extend that first stint to Lap 40 on the medium tyre, then doing the latter part of the race on the softs is possible. That would provide a big pace advantage over the hard compound in the same stint, but would need more management in the first part of the race. Plus, if it’s hotter than expected then the soft might degrade a bit too quickly to make such a long stint feasible, but teams will have that data from those who start on the softest compound. FACTS AND STATS: Verstappen starting P1, but no pole-sitter has finished on the podium here since 2016 These one-stop strategies are particularly attractive given the high likelihood of a Safety Car based on previous races, as a well-timed interruption for a driver yet to make a pit stop could gain them multiple positions, just as Charles Leclerc managed when starting on mediums last week in Austin. What are the options for the bottom half of the field? There’s also a two-stop strategy that can be considered by teams that don’t have two sets of mediums, but traffic will be the main concern. Starting on the softs, a first stint that mirrors the quickest strategy – as close to 22 laps as possible – would then be followed by a switch to mediums for the middle part of the race. Some management would be required here, but the medium’s consistency should allow drivers to target a stint of around 30 laps, then returning to the soft for the final part of the race when the car is at its lightest and the track rubbered in even more, as the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez often sees a high level of track evolution even through the race itself. READ MORE: Mexico City pole-sitter Verstappen expects ‘good fight’ for victory as home hero Perez rues costly qualifying issue The hard tyre is not a suitable tyre for the first part of the race because it provides too big a disadvantage off the line compared to the softer compounds, plus will be tough to switch on for drivers on high fuel on the low-grip surface. Low tyre temperatures combined with the lower levels of downforce due to the altitude is a recipe for sliding around, which is slow and damages the tyres.
Mercedes in the hunt and Bottas between the Ferraris – What To Watch For in the Mexico City GP, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.mercedes-in-the-hunt-and-bottas-between-the-ferraris-what-to-watch-for-in.1Til9uCyL6n0zg8tXzGdrU.html, They are in real danger of suffering the same fate this year, but in Mexico City the team look as competitive as they have all season. READ MORE: Verstappen fends off Mercedes pair for maiden Mexico City pole The challenge ahead of them is a clear one: beat Max Verstappen. 2022 Mexico City GP Qualifying: Max Verstappen seals pole position ahead of Mercedes pair2. The long run to Turn 1 Crucial to any driver’s hopes of a good race is the start in Mexico City, and we’ve often seen it impact matters at the front. Bottas between the Ferraris For another driver, just having a quiet start appears to be the target, with Valtteri Bottas finding himself on the third row., From Mercedes going for their first win of the year to the home favourite in the mix; and from Valtteri Bottas threatening the frontrunners to the unique challenge of the circuit’s altitude, we pick out some key areas to keep an eye on when the lights go out at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez… 1. Can Mercedes finally win in 2022? It has been over a decade since Mercedes last endured a winless season in Formula 1, with 2011 the last time they failed to get at least one driver on the top step of the podium over the course of the year. They are in real danger of suffering the same fate this year, but in Mexico City the team look as competitive as they have all season. READ MORE: Verstappen fends off Mercedes pair for maiden Mexico City pole The challenge ahead of them is a clear one: beat Max Verstappen. The double world champion spoiled Mercedes’ party on Saturday when he took pole position, beating George Russell – who had been fastest in FP2 and FP3 – and Lewis Hamilton, who had topped Q1 and Q2. Verstappen has to be the favourite given his form and the pace of the Red Bull all year but this is certainly a circuit that has suited Mercedes, because the high altitude means they suffer less from their high levels of drag, even when keeping the car’s high downforce level. Hamilton so nearly won in Austin and Mercedes showed they are getting closer to the front with an upgraded car, so Mexico is probably their best chance to date. 2022 Mexico City GP Qualifying: Max Verstappen seals pole position ahead of Mercedes pair 2. The long run to Turn 1 Crucial to any driver’s hopes of a good race is the start in Mexico City, and we’ve often seen it impact matters at the front. In each of the past four races, the pole-sitter has failed to win the race and that is in no small part to the slipstream effect that leaves you vulnerable off the line. With the 2022 cars the tow has been reduced because the car in front is not punching the same type of hole in the air as in the past, but it still has its benefits and with over 800 metres between pole position and the first braking zone, there is plenty of opportunity for a following car to gain. READ MORE: 'It was our pole to have' says Russell as he and Hamilton rue Q3 mistakes in Mexico City While admitting it’s going to be difficult, Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff says: “Starting second and third can be advantageous and I hope we can stick our nose, or both noses, into Turn 1 and then disappear into the distance.” Russell and Hamilton won’t be the only drivers aiming to make gains, though, as home hero Sergio Perez has a chance of making moves from fourth on the grid as he goes in search of what would be a massively popular victory among the passionate Mexican crowd. Could Mercedes pick up their first win of the year this weekend? 3. Bottas between the Ferraris For another driver, just having a quiet start appears to be the target, with Valtteri Bottas finding himself on the third row. Bottas has seen his brilliant early-season form hit by a less competitive Alfa Romeo as the year has gone on, but his one-lap pace was clear to see as he was regularly near the top of the timing screens throughout qualifying. The Finn believed seventh place was the best he could target – behind the Red Bull, Mercedes and Ferrari cars – but instead he managed to get the better of Charles Leclerc to secure sixth on the grid. READ MORE: 'It’s really uplifting for the whole team' – Bottas revels in P6 performance at Mexico City qualifying It’s a crucial time for Alfa Romeo, too, as they have seen their advantage in sixth place in the constructors’ championship whittled away by Aston Martin, to the point they now sit just three points ahead Mike Krack’s team. But with Sebastian Vettel starting from 16th place and Lance Stroll 20th, there’s a big opportunity for Bottas to earn them a little bit more breathing room. All smiles for Bottas who was in top form in qualifying 4. Alpine and McLaren resuming battle It’s a similar story when it comes to Alpine and McLaren, who appear to be intent on ensuring their fight for fourth overall goes down to the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi. Every time one team appears to have got the upper hand, the other soon pegs them back, and McLaren just chipped away at the Alpine advantage in Austin when Lando Norris overtook Fernando Alonso late on to close the gap to 11 points. FACTS AND STATS: Verstappen starting P1, but no pole-sitter has finished on the podium here since 2016 Norris is again leading the way in the battle this weekend in Mexico, starting from eighth ahead of Alonso in ninth and Esteban Ocon in tenth, but Daniel Ricciardo is also right in the fight at this stage as well as he lines up directly behind the Alpine pair in 11th. Strategies are likely to come into play in a race where the Alpine straight line speed advantage is lessened, and the French constructor could be the more nervous of the two teams when it comes to reliability, having seen both cars retire in Singapore to provide McLaren with a big chance to close the gap a few races ago. The McLaren/Alpine fight will continue here in Mexico

READ MORE: 5 things we learned from Friday practice at the Mexico City Grand Prix Max Verstappen and Red Bull were Mercedes’ nearest challengers, but the Dutchman – almost half a second off the pace – was left to rue a “terrible” first sector during an early lap on soft tyres and “the same problem again” at the start of his second run, which prompted him to back off, recharge and have another go. Behind, the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz took P4 and P6 respectively, sandwiching the other Red Bull of home favourite Sergio Perez, who sparked roars in the grandstands every time he completed a lap.
Mexico City Grand Prix: George Russell believes as Mercedes eye win, https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/63443267, The Mexico City Grand Prix is live on 5 Live and the BBC Sport websiteGeorge Russell believes Mercedes have a "reasonable shot" of winning the Mexico City Grand Prix. "The car has been feeling very good all weekend, and then my first lap in Q1, it was just awful. "The lap in Q3 was not a banker, but a good lap, a clean lap and I knew there was a lot more to come," Russell said. Russell felt Mercedes' competitiveness was a consequence of the altitude. Russell will have to get ahead - and stay ahead - of champion Verstappen (right)Why is pole not such a good thing?, The Mexico City Grand Prix is live on 5 Live and the BBC Sport website George Russell believes Mercedes have a "reasonable shot" of winning the Mexico City Grand Prix. That might not sound like the most overwhelming level of confidence, but in the context of a season Max Verstappen and Red Bull have taken almost total control of, it is really saying something. This has been a difficult year for Mercedes. With just three rounds to go, they are still to win a race. This could be their best chance yet - just a week after Lewis Hamilton came as close as he has done all year at the US Grand Prix in Austin, Texas. Russell and Hamilton start second and third, behind world champion Verstappen, for a race that has not been won from pole position since 2016, when Hamilton did it. Verstappen will still start as favourite. If he wins on Sunday, it will be his 14th victory of the season - a new all-time record. But Mercedes have looked competitive all weekend at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, and Russell felt the 0.304-second gap by which Verstappen beat him to pole - a lot on one of the shorter laps of the season - flattered the Red Bull driver. "It was a very difficult session," Russell said. "The car has been feeling very good all weekend, and then my first lap in Q1, it was just awful. I was driving terribly and I just had no rhythm whatsoever." By the start of the final session - Q3 - Russell seemed to have his rhythm back. He was 0.143secs off Verstappen on their opening laps and felt he could do substantially better. "The lap in Q3 was not a banker, but a good lap, a clean lap and I knew there was a lot more to come," Russell said. "And when I started pushing more, I got bitten by the car." This was the problem with the Mercedes car that Hamilton described in the interview he did with BBC Sport and three selected other outlets in Austin last weekend, and which was published on Thursday. "Taking the car to the limit," Hamilton said, "is like creeping up behind a horse - you're trying to get as close as possible. What's the breaking point before it kicks you in the face? And you know it's going to hurt when it hits your face." Russell said after qualifying: "I am disappointed because I felt like the team deserved pole position, but ultimately the points are on Sunday and we will be going for the win. "It's a shame but we are starting P2, second best quali of the year, and there are a lot of positives to take away. "We think we have a reasonable shot, and having Lewis at the front as well gives us the opportunity to do something different on the strategy." Hamilton, too, felt he was in with a shot of what would have been his first pole of the year. Fastest in both first and second qualifying, Hamilton had good reason to be confident going into the final session. But he was judged to have cut the third corner on his first lap, and his time was disallowed. That meant he had to be a little cautious on his final run, because messing that up would have meant starting 10th. On top of that, he was suffering engine problems that slowed him out of the corners. "No real major issues," Hamilton said. "Some engine issues; some performance left on the table with that, unfortunately. "Losing the first lap made it a bit more difficult because I had to keep it clean, so not able to push as hard as I would have liked. "[The engine problem] started to appear in Q2 and then it was every run in Q3. "Basically I was dropping out of power on exits of corners, so I definitely think we were losing quite a bit of time. It felt like an ignition issue but I will find out from the team." Mercedes said the problem was oscillation in the driveline. Overall, though, Hamilton was happy. "Second and third is not a bad position to start," he said. 'People choose narrative that suits' - Horner on budget cap fine Why are Mercedes so competitive? Russell felt Mercedes' competitiveness was a consequence of the altitude. Mexico City is more than 2,200m above sea level, so the air is thin, which has a significant effect on F1 cars. Although the track has long straights, teams run their cars in the highest downforce configuration possible because the low air density reduces the effectiveness of their aerodynamics. It also reduces drag - and this is the key for Mercedes, for whom one of the most significant problems this year has been the draggy nature of their car. Russell said: "Red Bull have a very efficient car and have been taking a huge amount of time out of us on straights. This weekend, that has been less and it's probably why we have had the fastest car this weekend." Russell will have to get ahead - and stay ahead - of champion Verstappen (right) Why is pole not such a good thing? This race was won from third on the grid last year, from fourth in 2019, and second in 2018 and 2017. Why is it so difficult to win from pole in Mexico, and why is qualifying second and third almost considered an advantage? Part of the explanation is that the run to the first corner from the grid is more than 800m, one of the longest of the year, which gives the drivers behind a good opportunity to gain ground using the tow. This is how Verstappen managed to grab the lead at the start last year, despite Mercedes having a front-row lockout - although some of that was Valtteri Bottas, Russell's predecessor in the team, not doing his job properly and failing to block the Red Bull. The problem for Russell and Hamilton, though, is that the Red Bull remains a quicker car, and it is still prodigiously fast on the straights. Mercedes might have less of a drag disadvantage than usual, but overtaking the Red Bull will remain a problem. Hamilton said: "It is always a tough race around here with track temperatures and tyres but these guys have been rapid all year and even when we are at our best, we are still losing out on straight-line speed. "It will be difficult to get past them but we will give it our best shot and Turn One is an opportunity." Verstappen, who has won three of the last four races in Mexico, said: "I started everywhere except pole here and we won races so it is always important to have a good start. "Our top speed is not too bad to defend when people are in the draft. We just need to focus. If we have good race pace it will be a good fight, anyway."
Ricciardo radio silence says everything, https://www.news.com.au/sport/motorsport/formula-one/ricciardo-radio-silence-says-everything-after-mexico-grand-prix-slap/news-story/d4bcd236adc580908b7ebce6998427db, , 
Max Verstappen takes high ground over Lewis Hamilton as Brit "doesn't use my name", https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/verstappen-hamilton-rivalry-mercedes-redbull-28362591, There were suggestions across the off-season that Hamilton was so disillusioned by it that he would quit. "People have told me that he doesn't use my name," Verstappen told the Mail on Sunday. But while he seems to think Hamilton holds a grudge, Verstappen insists he has nothing but respect for the seven-time world champion. He added: "I was always taught that you have to respect what people have achieved in sport. We all know that, but you still have to beat your team-mate and Lewis has done that consistently., In a fresh interview, newly-crowned double F1 world champion Verstappen suggested he feels a lack of respect from his old title rival Hamilton after their epic tussle for the 2021 crown Max Verstappen revealed he is aware of the general belief that Lewis Hamilton goes out of his way to avoid saying his name. The relationship between the two Formula 1 drivers – if there was one to begin with – deteriorated last year as they went all-out to beat each other in the title race. And, of course, it ended on a highly controversial note as Verstappen snatched the title on the last lap thanks to race director Michael Masi's botched implementation of safety car rules. There were suggestions across the off-season that Hamilton was so disillusioned by it that he would quit. While that turned out not to be the case, many believe the Brit still harbours ill-feeling towards the Dutchman, who romped to the title this year with little challenge from others. Hamilton even appears to avoid referring to him by name in interviews, preferring instead to speak about Red Bull in general and using "they" instead of "he" whenever he praises their dominance. "People have told me that he doesn't use my name," Verstappen told the Mail on Sunday. But while he seems to think Hamilton holds a grudge, Verstappen insists he has nothing but respect for the seven-time world champion. He added: "I was always taught that you have to respect what people have achieved in sport. I have no problem with what Lewis has achieved. He is one of the best ever. "I know it is not only the car he has been driving. That helps. We all know that, but you still have to beat your team-mate and Lewis has done that consistently. I think you have to acknowledge the person has done an amazing job as well." Image: REUTERS) REUTERS) The circumstances of his first victory mean Verstappen is a divisive character. Many adore him, while he also has his fair share of critics. The boos he received from some American fans in Texas last weekend helped to illustrate that, and it hasn't been helped by Red Bull's cost cap saga. He does not particularly care for either extreme. "Fame was not anything I looked into when I was a kid. I never wanted to be known. I wish I could walk around and nobody would know me," said the Dutchman. "Actually before Suzuka, I went to Tokyo and was not recognised too much. It was amazing. I can hardly think of the last time I could do that in a major city. "People are always nice and I understand they want something from me. But from my perspective it would be nice to be left alone. I am not here to be liked and it's not going to ruin my day. I am having a great time with my team. People can say what they like, but I am here to perform."

Ricciardo cops brutal miss but still lands best quali result in five races, https://www.foxsports.com.au/motorsport/formula-one/formula-1-2022-mexican-grand-prix-qualifying-results-times-blog-live-updates-stream-start-time-practice/news-story/83264ad786e849bf983e29b40888fc77, Daniel Ricciardo secured his best qualifying result in five races, but narrowly missed out on an appearance in the third qualifying session for top-ten drivers at the Mexican Grand Prix. In an incredibly close and dramatic session, Ricciardo made it out of Q1 for the first time in five races, only to be dumped out as the 11th-fastest driver in Q2 by just 0.053s. “That was a good qualifying,” the Dutchman said. “I feel good… I feel really, really good,” he said. “I generally had a really good session today., Daniel Ricciardo secured his best qualifying result in five races, but narrowly missed out on an appearance in the third qualifying session for top-ten drivers at the Mexican Grand Prix. It comes after the Australian opened up on the “most challenging year” ahead of qualifying. In an incredibly close and dramatic session, Ricciardo made it out of Q1 for the first time in five races, only to be dumped out as the 11th-fastest driver in Q2 by just 0.053s.

Start your free trial now > But Max Verstappen, already confirmed as the World Champion this season, soared to pole ahead of the Mercedes duo George Russell and Lewis Hamilton. His 1m 17.775s left Russell second by 0.304s – after he had his final run rubbed off for exceeding track limits – and Hamilton a marginal 0.005s off in P3. Verstappen took control on his first run in Q3 and then trimmed his time to resist the threat from the much-improved Mercedes team. He will be hunting a record 14th win in a single season on Sunday. “That was a good qualifying,” the Dutchman said. “It was a close one, but we made a few adjustments to the car and got into a better rhythm so to be on pole here is, of course, amazing. “It’s a very long run down to Turn One here, so we need a good start, but I think we have a quick car and that’s what is most important. The passion of the fans here is really incredible and, in the stadium, it is just amazing to drive there.” Sergio Perez was fourth in the other Red Bull for his home Grand Prix. Ricciardo finished the third and final practice session in P14, the same result as the second practice session as the Australian’s struggles at McLaren continued. But he found pace in qualifying, and will be disappointed not to have reached Q3 as one of the top 10 drivers. Audi get partner for 2026 F1 play | 00:27 It has been a tough year for Ricciardo, who admitted in an interview with The Daily Mail ahead of this week’s race that he was not his normal “bubbly self” as results slipped. “My confidence was being eaten away driving a car that wouldn’t dance with me and would bite back,” Ricciardo said. “Whenever we thought we found a solution, along would come another set of challenges. When you put so much into something and it doesn’t work out, there is sadness. It gets to you. “Last year it affected me a little bit too much. I wouldn’t be my usual bubbly self. I would be reluctant if someone said let’s go out for dinner. I would need some cajoling. I let it get to me. “I started to speak to a psychologist last year, the most challenging year I have had.” Ricciardo will have a fresh start next year, with the Australian expected to take up a reserve driver role either at Mercedes or Red Bull. It comes after McLaren’s decision to axe Ricciardo earlier this year, something which the 33-year-old admits came as a surprise. “It is fair to say it was unexpected, given I was on a three-year deal that had a year to run,” he said. “It is not something you can prepare for. But I’d already had some honest discussions with Andreas (Seidel, team principal) and Zak (Brown, chief executive) earlier in the year to see what we could do to improve things. “It was a concern on both sides.” Qualifying disappointment for Ricciardo | 01:24 In other news, having set the pace with a leading time of 1.19.970, Mercedes’ George Russell is hoping he and teammate Lewis Hamilton can continue their success in qualifying. “I’d like to think it’s definitely [a] podium [that’s] possible, at least. It’s probably one of, if not our best Friday of the year,” Russell told the Formula 1’s official website when asked of his expectations for the weekend. “Between the two of us [Russell and team mate Lewis Hamilton], we’ve got 14 podiums [so far this season], so that’s absolutely what we’ll be going for. But not having the normal FP2 running, where you get to understand the long run, the consecutive laps of your rivals, it’s going to be difficult to know.” Hamilton finished the day in fourth and having settled for second place at the United States Grand Prix, he too is also keen to potentially shoot for top spot this weekend. “I feel good… I feel really, really good,” he said. “I generally had a really good session today. I really enjoyed driving around the track. The car is feeling better and better as we work more through it, and we understand it more.” George Russell is pretty confident. (Photo by Jared C.

Leclerc though did not seem too worried about the damage impacting his chances ahead of qualifying and Monday morning’s race. “I don’t think any of it will compromise us,” he said. “I think we have enough [parts] now with all the penalties we’ve had in the past, so it should be fine.” Follow all the action with the live blog below!

The five F1 drivers that shocked us during Mexico City GP qualifying, https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1015979/1/five-f1-drivers-shocked-us-during-mexico-city-gp-qualifying, Charles Leclerc - 7thIt was a rare off day in qualifying for Charles Leclerc - the man with nine pole positions to his name in 2022. Speaking after qualifying in Mexico, Leclerc hinted at a potential engine issue which hampered his performance in qualifying. Sebastian Vettel - 17thAfter an impressive run of races for Aston Martin, Sebastian Vettel was knocked out in Q1 in Mexico City. Max Verstappen - 1stThe reigning world champion saved his best for last in qualifying in Mexico. It’s timely considering Aston Martin’s remarkable run of results, putting Alfa Romeo under immense pressure in the race for sixth., Charles Leclerc - 7th It was a rare off day in qualifying for Charles Leclerc - the man with nine pole positions to his name in 2022. Leclerc ultimately qualified a disappointing seventh, even losing out on a position to Alfa Romeo’s Valtteri Bottas in the dying stages of Q3. While their pace has often looked to be on par with Red Bull and Mercedes, the driveability of the Ferrari has looked very tricky, particularly in the middle part of the lap. Both Leclerc and Carlos Sainz have been seen on countless occasions correcting oversteer moments and struggling with the rear of their car. Speaking after qualifying in Mexico, Leclerc hinted at a potential engine issue which hampered his performance in qualifying. “It was a difficult session but there is a problem I am sure. We need to look into it. It was mostly engine-wise, we were losing a lot of time down the straights. And there were lots of problems with driveability, the engine was not responding to the throttle. Especially at high speed it was extremely difficult. “I really hope we can fix that for tomorrow, if yes, I feel confident we can have a good result. If not, I am not sure how it will go. I think this is really a one off. For me it was really strange. So we need to look into it and I hope we can find something for tomorrow.” Issue or not, it was a surprise to see Leclerc so far down the order. Sebastian Vettel - 17th After an impressive run of races for Aston Martin, Sebastian Vettel was knocked out in Q1 in Mexico City. The shock wasn’t particularly Vettel or teammate Lance Stroll’s performance, but more Aston Martin’s lack of performance at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez. Aston Martin have scored 24 points in the last three races, allowing them to move within three points of Alfa Romeo for sixth in the constructors’ standings. Seeing both Aston Martins out in Q1 was surprising but a testament to how quickly things can change in F1’s midfield. Which F1 drivers had a great day? Max Verstappen - 1st The reigning world champion saved his best for last in qualifying in Mexico. His pole margin was an enormous three-tenths - something that looked very unlikely in the earlier sessions. Verstappen will go in search of his 14th victory of the year, and if he wins on Sunday, it will be a record for the most wins in a season. “It was a good qualifying, I think it was a close one," Verstappen said “I think after FP3 we made a few adjustments on the car and got into a better rhythm, and to be on pole here is of course amazing. “Of course, it's a very long run to Turn 1, so we do need a good start. Anyway, I think we have a quick car, and that's, of course, what's most important.” George Russell - 2nd It was the first time since the summer break that George Russell out-qualified Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton. Without a mistake in the final sector, a second pole of the year could have been his. Regardless, it was a welcome return to form for Russell, who by his own admission, has been below par since the summer break. While Hamilton had his own issues in qualifying, it was important for Russell to get back ahead of his teammate and be in a position to attack Verstappen on the first lap. Valtteri Bottas - 6th The overall star of qualifying was Bottas. Since introducing several upgrades at Suzuka, Alfa Romeo appear to be back to being a top 10 contending outfit. It’s timely considering Aston Martin’s remarkable run of results, putting Alfa Romeo under immense pressure in the race for sixth. Bottas hasn’t finished inside the top 10 since the Canadian Grand Prix but he’s in a great position to end his drought on Sunday.
Verstappen: "Very hard to nail" pole lap at low-grip Mexico F1 track, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/verstappen-very-hard-to-nail-mexico-f1-pole-lap-/10392499/, That put him clear of George Russell and Hamilton by 0.304s and 0.309s, taking his sixth pole of the 2022 campaign. Speaking in the post-qualifying press conference, Verstappen was delighted with his result after coming back against the Mercedes pair in qualifying. “Of course, I’m very happy with them because around here it’s very hard to – for me at least – to nail the lap. Verstappen replied: “Honestly, I think everywhere I just gained a little bit – it was not like I made a mistake on my first lap. “It was just a couple of corners where [there] was maybe tiny track evolution as well., Listen to this article Verstappen trailed Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton in both Q1 and Q2 in qualifying at the low-grip Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez track, but then led from the off in the final segment before sealing pole with a fastest time at the death in Q3. That put him clear of George Russell and Hamilton by 0.304s and 0.309s, taking his sixth pole of the 2022 campaign. Speaking in the post-qualifying press conference, Verstappen was delighted with his result after coming back against the Mercedes pair in qualifying. He was also pleased his team produced a smooth effort to seal pole at a track where the high altitude reduces the available downforce and leaves cars sliding on a surface some drivers have described as ‘like ice’. “It was a bit of a tricky start to qualifying because the track was a bit warmer than FP3 – so I think everyone was sliding around a bit more and it was a bit more difficult to find your rhythm,” Verstappen explained. “So, it was really about [learning changes from] Q1-to-Q2-to-Q3 – trying to find the balance in the car again. “At the end of the session it got a little better and I think in Q3 we finally could push a little bit more with the car and [I did] two decent laps, I think. “Of course, I’m very happy with them because around here it’s very hard to – for me at least – to nail the lap. “It’s just very low grip and there are a few kerbs you have to perfectly hit to actually gain time. “So, it’s definitely not the easiest of qualifyings or races. And the same for the tyre warm-up. But it seems like in Q3 we had the right picture.” Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing Photo by: Carl Bingham / Motorsport Images Verstappen also said that he and Red Bull were just “just fine-tuning a few things on the [steering] wheel [that] everyone is allowed [to do]” to find “a good balance” in time for the critical Q3 runs. After setting a 1m17.947s on his opening Q3 effort, Verstappen improved to a 1m17.775s on the lap that secured pole – his first at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez after he lost the accolade in 2019 for a yellow flag infringement. When asked where he had improved between the two runs by Autosport/Motorsport.com. Verstappen replied: “Honestly, I think everywhere I just gained a little bit – it was not like I made a mistake on my first lap. “It was just a couple of corners where [there] was maybe tiny track evolution as well. Just trying to nail it the whole time.”

Perez: F1 Mexican GP qualifying "a total mess" due to electrical problem, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/perez-f1-mexican-gp-qualifying-a-total-mess-due-to-electrical-problem/10392488/, The electrical issue also created a DRS problem that left him seventh in Q1, although that problem was rectified for the later sessions. He then got through Q2 in fifth place before improving by one spot in the final part of qualifying. "It was a mess, a total mess," he said of qualifying. So it was a total mess, but in the end I think P4 is not the worst bit, but I think certainly we could have been quite a lot higher than we are." Asked by Motorsport.com about his Q1 DRS problem, Perez said: "It was all to do with the electrical issue that we had throughout the quali., Listen to this article The local driver was left without information on his dashboard, including laptimes, and in the end he was relieved to recover to earn fourth on the grid for Sunday's race. The electrical issue also created a DRS problem that left him seventh in Q1, although that problem was rectified for the later sessions. He then got through Q2 in fifth place before improving by one spot in the final part of qualifying. "It was a mess, a total mess," he said of qualifying. "We had an electrical issue from the beginning but, if I look back at my quali, I was nearly knocked out in Q1, nearly in Q2, I had no reference to progress, I had no lap times. "Sometimes I could not figure out where I was with my brake balance either. So it was a total mess, but in the end I think P4 is not the worst bit, but I think certainly we could have been quite a lot higher than we are." Asked by Motorsport.com about his Q1 DRS problem, Perez said: "It was all to do with the electrical issue that we had throughout the quali. "Basically I had no reference with lap times and so on. [DRS] came back, the only thing that didn't come back was my electrical. They are confident that they can sort that out [for the race]." Sergio Perez, Red Bull Racing Photo by: Mark Sutton / Motorsport Images Perez admitted that it was particularly painful to endure such a difficult session at his home event. "Obviously if there's a quali that you want to have everything perfect, it's this one, especially given how close we were to pole, I think certainly we would have progressed much more than what we did," he said. But Perez did acknowledge that he could use the traditional Mexico City tow off the grid to gain ground on the first lap. "I think there's a lot of things we can do for tomorrow, so we will try our very best," he added. "Tomorrow I just want to win and I will do my best into Turn 1, and see what happens." Asked if he will be aggressive, he said: "Yeah. Mainly into Turn 1! Because, after that, it can be a bit chaotic, and at the stops, it will be all about that."
Hamilton puzzled by Q3 issue in Mexican GP qualifying, https://racingnews365.com/hamilton-puzzled-by-q3-issue-in-mexican-gp-qualfying, Lewis Hamilton believes an issue with his Formula 1 power unit hindered any further progress up the grid for the Mexican Grand Prix. With Mercedes on the pace in Mexico, Hamilton was a threat for Pole Position, and topped both Q1 and Q2 on Saturday but had his first effort deleted in Q3 for exceeding track limits at Turn 3. His sole effort was then only good enough for third, just 0.005s behind teammate George Russell but 0.309s slower than pole-man Max Verstappen. However, the seven-time World Champion believes an issue with the car cost him., Lewis Hamilton believes an issue with his Formula 1 power unit hindered any further progress up the grid for the Mexican Grand Prix.

Russell "kicking" himself after "terrible" lap that cost F1 pole shot, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/russell-kicking-himself-after-terrible-lap-that-cost-f1-pole-shot/10392465/, But Russell endured a scrappy final lap, struggling with oversteer at Turn 5 before running wide at Turn 12 at the end of the back straight. Verstappen found more time on his final lap to take pole by three tenths of a second from Russell, but the Briton was left ruing his scruffy last effort. I feel like it was our pole to have, and it was just a terrible lap from my side, so I'm sort of kicking myself. Russell felt Mercedes "didn't really get an opportunity to show what it was truly capable of" over the United States Grand Prix weekend, but felt the high altitude conditions were allowing it to show more of its potential. Asked about Mercedes' long run pace heading into the race, Russell felt the team was "looking competitive" and has a "reasonable shot" in the battle at the front., Listen to this article Russell topped both FP2 and FP3 for Mercedes at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, and looked to be in the fight for pole after sitting just 0.132s off Verstappen following the opening runs in Q3. But Russell endured a scrappy final lap, struggling with oversteer at Turn 5 before running wide at Turn 12 at the end of the back straight. This caused him to run wide and ultimately lose time. Verstappen found more time on his final lap to take pole by three tenths of a second from Russell, but the Briton was left ruing his scruffy last effort. "The team deserved more today, they've produced a really great car this weekend, and I think it's testament to them for the hard work they've been putting in for so long," said Russell. "We saw last week Lewis showed what the car was capable of. I feel like it was our pole to have, and it was just a terrible lap from my side, so I'm sort of kicking myself. "But at the end of the day, no points for qualifying and I'm excited to be back on the front row." Russell will line up just ahead of teammate Lewis Hamilton as Mercedes enjoyed its best qualifying result of the 2022 season on Saturday. George Russell, Mercedes W13 Photo by: Steven Tee / Motorsport Images The team has three races remaining to try and end its winless campaign, and looked to boost its late-season chances while aiding its development for next year with its final W13 car update in Austin. Russell felt Mercedes "didn't really get an opportunity to show what it was truly capable of" over the United States Grand Prix weekend, but felt the high altitude conditions were allowing it to show more of its potential. "With this high altitude, the drag is less of a factor, and that is where we get outscored by Red Bull, let's say," said Russell. "They're always taking like three tenths out of us on the straight. Here it's less of a factor, so that's probably why we're a little bit more competitive." Asked about Mercedes' long run pace heading into the race, Russell felt the team was "looking competitive" and has a "reasonable shot" in the battle at the front. "Having Lewis at the front gives us the chance to do something different with the strategy," he said. "We'll see what we can do."

Mexican Grand Prix qualifying results: Verstappen on pole from Russell What happened in Mexican Grand Prix Q1? Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc set the early pace at 1m19.505s before Verstappen beat him by 0.283s with 1m19.222s. Valtteri Bottas was next up for Alfa Romeo, 0.004s ahead of Hamilton. Hamilton ran again and improved the quickest time to 1m19.169s, 0.053s faster than Verstappen. Falling at the first hurdle were Mick Schumacher (Haas, who lost a top-six laptime due to exceeding track limits by chopping the apex kerb at Turn 2), the Aston Martins of Sebastian Vettel and Lance Stroll (who has a three-place grid drop), and the Williams duo of Alex Albon and Nicholas Latifi. Mexican Grand Prix Q1 results: Hamilton fastest from Verstappen What happened in Mexican Grand Prix Q2?

Knocked out at this point were Daniel Ricciardo (McLaren), Zhou Guanyu (Alfa Romeo), the AlphaTauris of Yuki Tsunoda and Pierre Gasly, and Kevin Magnussen (Haas, who has a five-place grid penalty). Mexican Grand Prix Q2 results: Hamilton fastest from Sainz What happened in Mexican Grand Prix Q3?

Mexican GP: Verstappen storms to F1 pole ahead of Russell Hamilton, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/mexican-gp-verstappen-storms-to-f1-pole-ahead-of-russell-hamilton/10392422/, Following Perez, the two Ferrari drivers could not recover from slow opening sectors on their last laps, with Sainz unable to improve his personal best from the first runs and the Spaniard ending up fifth. While the focus was on the frontrunners, Bottas slipped in a 1m18.401s having been in the top six in both Q1 and Q2 in a strong showing for Alfa. Daniel Ricciardo was the highest-placed faller in Q2, the Australian the only driver not to set a personal best on their final flier, missing out behind Alonso in the middle segment by just 0.053s. Sebastian Vettel ended 17th but behind Schumacher because the younger German driver set his identical 1m20.491s first, with Lance Stroll just behind in the other Aston Martin. Stroll will start last as a result of his penalty for his incident with Alonso in Austin., Listen to this article Home hero Sergio Perez took fourth, while Alfa Romeo's Valtteri Bottas was a surprise star of qualifying to split the Ferrari drivers and secure sixth on the grid for Sunday's race at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez. After Hamilton had led Q1 and Q2, he lost his opening time in Q3 for cutting Turn 3, with Verstappen leading at the head of the times after those first runs in the final segment, his 1m17.947s breaking into the 1m17s bracket for the first time all session. Perez, like he had in the first runs, led the pack around for the final fliers and he improved with his last go, but not by enough to topple his teammate nor Russell, who trailed by 0.132s after the opening goes. Following Perez, the two Ferrari drivers could not recover from slow opening sectors on their last laps, with Sainz unable to improve his personal best from the first runs and the Spaniard ending up fifth. Leclerc did improve but not by enough to trouble the top positions, which left the focus on the Mercedes drivers after Verstappen then flashed through to improve the best time to a 1m17.775s. That became the pole lap when Hamilton finally registered a Q3 time that was 0.309s behind Verstappen's new best and still not quicker than Russell, who lost his final time for sliding off track beyond the Turn 12 exit kerbs entering the stadium but had done enough already to secure second. While the focus was on the frontrunners, Bottas slipped in a 1m18.401s having been in the top six in both Q1 and Q2 in a strong showing for Alfa. Behind Leclerc came Lando Norris and Fernando Alonso, who completed just a single run in Q3 during the action lull between the two efforts completed by all the rest, with Esteban Ocon rounding out the top 10 in the other Alpine. Daniel Ricciardo was the highest-placed faller in Q2, the Australian the only driver not to set a personal best on their final flier, missing out behind Alonso in the middle segment by just 0.053s. Behind Ricciardo came Zhou Guanyu, then the AlphaTauri pair of Yuki Tsunoda and Pierre Gasly – both frustrated by their lap of grip and the latter particularly annoyed to end up out after completing a clean final run. The final driver eliminated in Q2 was Kevin Magnussen, who will drop five places on the grid for Sunday's race for Haas having to fit a sixth internal combustion engine of the year to his car after it ground to a halt during FP1 with Pietro Fittipaldi aboard. In Q1, Zhou's last-gasp improvement knocked out Mick Schumacher, the Haas driver losing his penultimate lap that would have easily been fast enough to get through for cutting the kerbs at Turn 2. Although Schumacher, who ended up just behind his grid-penalty-addled teammate at the end of Q1, set a personal best on his final flier, it was 0.8s slower than his deleted previous time and left him vulnerable as the final laps in the opening segment were completed. Sebastian Vettel ended 17th but behind Schumacher because the younger German driver set his identical 1m20.491s first, with Lance Stroll just behind in the other Aston Martin. Stroll will start last as a result of his penalty for his incident with Alonso in Austin. The Williams pair of Alex Albon and Nicholas Latifi brought up the rear of the field, with the former the only driver knocked out in Q1 not to set a personal best on his final lap – thanks to an off-track moment at Turn 8, having had to catch a rear axle slide in the preceding corner.

Will Red Bull’s aero penalty really hurt as much as it claims?, https://the-race.com/formula-1/will-red-bulls-aero-penalty-really-hurt-as-much-as-it-claims/, Christian Horner says Red Bull will lose up to half a second of laptime thanks to its cost cap penalty, but rival Formula 1 teams think he’s overstating the potential impact. The knock-on impact of Red Bull penalty that’s upset Ferrari Read moreMcLaren has reiterated calls for stricter punishments for cost-cap breaches since the FIA announced Red Bull’s sanctions, and it has been suggested by some that it would take at least a 20% reduction in Red Bull’s ATA to offset a two-tenth lap time gain. Red Bull’s ATA was already set to be 5% less than whichever team finishes second in the 2022 constructors’ championship, but that gap grows to 12% with the cost-cap penalty factored in. Read moreShovlin also said the scale of Red Bull’s penalty is “not as big as the penalty if you’re positioned two places higher” in the championship, and he is right. Is Red Bull’s F1 cost cap penalty adequate?, Christian Horner says Red Bull will lose up to half a second of laptime thanks to its cost cap penalty, but rival Formula 1 teams think he’s overstating the potential impact. Ferrari has already said it believes Red Bull’s F1 overspend in 2021 equates to performance gain of 0.2s, and does not “understand how 10% reduction of the ATA [Aerodynamic Testing Allowance] can correspond to the same amount of laptime” according to sporting director Laurent Mekies. The knock-on impact of Red Bull penalty that’s upset Ferrari Read more McLaren has reiterated calls for stricter punishments for cost-cap breaches since the FIA announced Red Bull’s sanctions, and it has been suggested by some that it would take at least a 20% reduction in Red Bull’s ATA to offset a two-tenth lap time gain. Horner has described the 10% penalty as “significant”, “enormous” and “draconian”, saying it “represents anywhere between quarter and half a second worth of laptime” and pointing out that Red Bull uses an outdated windtunnel that compounds the damage. But Mercedes’ trackside engineering director Andrew Shovlin said “the scale of that penalty isn’t much more than what you would lose if you’re just one place higher in the championship”. Red Bull’s ATA was already set to be 5% less than whichever team finishes second in the 2022 constructors’ championship, but that gap grows to 12% with the cost-cap penalty factored in. This means Red Bull will get 38 fewer windtunnel runs and 240 fewer CFD test items allocated per eight-week aero testing period for 2023 than its nearest rival. That deficit would have been only 16 windtunnel runs and 100 CFD items had Red Bull not been punished for exceeding the cost cap. Is Red Bull’s ‘relic of Cold War’ F1 windtunnel claim valid? Read more Shovlin also said the scale of Red Bull’s penalty is “not as big as the penalty if you’re positioned two places higher” in the championship, and he is right. Mercedes would be 32 windtunnel runs and 200 CFD items better off than Red Bull next year under the standard ATA – so 22 windtunnel runs and 140 CFD runs extra reduction equates to roughly 1.5 championship positions. “I think describing it as ‘draconian’ is an exaggeration,” Shovlin said. “Reducing the number of runs does limit your freedom when you’re developing a concept, but we’re in reasonably well explored regulations now. “You definitely have to be more efficient, but if it was half a second then a team at the back of the grid would have an advantage of over three seconds to one at the front – and that’s simply not the case. “But it depends on how well you make decisions in the year. I’d have thought a tenth or maybe a bit more than a tenth, maybe two tenths at the upper end, is realistically what that would cost you.” This assessment is consistent with the one Mattia Binotto made ahead of this season, when asked to quantify the development advantage Ferrari enjoyed under the ATA from finishing only sixth in the 2020 constructors’ championship and third in 2021. Is Red Bull’s F1 cost cap penalty adequate? Our verdict Read more “If you look at the amount, it’s a couple of sessions on the entire year, it’s maybe a tenth per lap, if you are very good,” Binotto said in February. “And then it’s all how you manage priorities, how good you are and how efficient in your activities.” Shovlin made a rough estimate of the 10% penalty costing Red Bull “four to five runs” per week in the windtunnel, but said actually the penalty would only really hurt if Red Bull has “chosen an incorrect concept and you need to backtrack. It’s removing that freedom to explore different avenues”. Dividing the number of wind tunnel runs extra Red Bull loses under its penalty by eight, to give a weekly figure, suggests Red Bull will be three runs per week worse off and 18 CFD items per week worse off under the terms of its cost cap penalty. Given Red Bull has already developed a very effective and efficient concept under F1’s new rules, there is also less likelihood it will suddenly start developing in the wrong direction in the season to come. Alfa Romeo boss Fred Vasseur feels the bigger punishment for Red Bull is the reputational and PR damage done by being found to be in breach of the cost cap in the first place. “I think the biggest punishment is to accept they were overspending in terms of image – we don’t have to underestimate this one for your employees, for your sponsors and so on,” said Vasseur, whose team is fighting to reach the current cost cap spending limit. He supported Shovlin’s suggestion that Red Bull is overestimating the effect of a 10% further reduction in its ATA – saying “I’m not sure we are making [that] advancement with 10% of your allocation, or we are very stupid…”

Not that Verstappen was not brilliantly quick, bursting the 1min 18sec barrier - the only man to do so. He had just set the third best lap before it was scrubbed. Mercedes had thought their best chance might be in Austin for the US Grand Prix and they brought a host of upgrades to that race. Sportsmail's Ryan Walker provided live blog updates for qualifying at the Mexican Grand Prix., Max Verstappen took pole position for the Mexican Grand Prix - setting himself up for a record-breaking 14th win of the season on Sunday. Mercedes had looked strong all day but you can never discount the Red Bull juggernaut and so it proved in the thin air of Mexico City. Not that Verstappen was not brilliantly quick, bursting the 1min 18sec barrier - the only man to do so. He ended up on 1min 17.775sec, 0.304sec ahead of second-quickest George Russell, who made a mistake on his final flying lap, and 0.0309sec ahead of Lewis Hamilton, who was third fastest. Max Verstappen has taken pole position ahead of the Mexico Grand Prix on Sunday evening Hamilton (left) starts third, Russell (right) starts second, while Verstappen (centre) takes pole The two-time world champion stormed to a sixth pole of the season in Mexico City So it is Red Bull-Mercedes-Mercedes on the grid at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, with its long run into the first corner. Interesting. Hamilton did well to recover third spot on the grid after having his first Q3 time deleted for exceeding track limits. He had just set the third best lap before it was scrubbed. He came back out and held his nerve but could not pip Russell or in any way match Verstappen. Lewis Hamilton suffered power issues on his flying lap in the final qualifying session in Mexico Sergio Perez was fourth best for Red Bull, but three-and-a-half-tenths off Verstappen's pace. Mercedes had thought their best chance might be in Austin for the US Grand Prix and they brought a host of upgrades to that race. Hamilton led there when Verstappen was trapped in his pit box as the wheel gun misfired, but he was easily passed by the Dutchman and finished runner-up. Hamilton lead for the majority of qualifying as Mercedes looked fast throughout the weekend Mercedes have come to Mexico City armed with a new front wing and that seems to be working well. They are helped by the thin air, 7,740ft above sea level, reducing the car's drag. Lando Norris qualified eighth for McLaren.

Russell leads Mercedes 1-2 as rivals struggle in practice, https://the-race.com/formula-1/russell-leads-mercedes-1-2-as-ferrari-and-red-bull-struggle/, George Russell led a Mercedes 1-2 in final practice for the Mexican Grand Prix, relegating Formula 1 world champion Max Verstappen to a distant third. Russell looked rapid on both of his soft-tyre runs and finished up well clear of Red Bull and Ferrari. Russell went massively quicker on his second run, setting a 1m18.399s lap that stood as the fastest of the session, the car looking particularly strong through the low-speed corners at the start and finish of the lap. His Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton was actually quicker across the first two-thirds of the lap on his own second run, but he lost time through the final sector and wound up 0.154s down. These two then slipped out of the top six when Carlos Sainz made a late improvement in the second Ferrari, with a lap which was still a full nine tenths off the impressive pace set by Russell., George Russell led a Mercedes 1-2 in final practice for the Mexican Grand Prix, relegating Formula 1 world champion Max Verstappen to a distant third. Key moments – Russell leads Mercedes 1-2 – Verstappen nearly half a second off – Ferrari only fourth and sixth Mercedes expects to go well on such a high-altitude F1 circuit, knowing it can run the W13 at its highest downforce settings without the car being compromised by excessive drag in the way it usually is. Russell looked rapid on both of his soft-tyre runs and finished up well clear of Red Bull and Ferrari. His initial 1m19.405s benchmark was bettered twice by Verstappen’s Red Bull, which did a 1m19.296s lap – which Verstappen described as “terrible with the kerbs” in sector one – and then a 1m19.118s before Russell took charge on his second set of new red-walled Pirellis and inflicted the damage. Russell went massively quicker on his second run, setting a 1m18.399s lap that stood as the fastest of the session, the car looking particularly strong through the low-speed corners at the start and finish of the lap. His Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton was actually quicker across the first two-thirds of the lap on his own second run, but he lost time through the final sector and wound up 0.154s down. Verstappen made another attempt, but went too deep at Turn 4 so backed out of his first flying lap, then could only manage a time just under half a second slower than Russell’s Mercedes when he tried again. Charles Leclerc languished outside the top 10 in his repaired Ferrari until a late effort lifted him to fourth, but the best of the Ferrari drivers was still seven tenths off the ultimate pace, complaining of the car being very difficult to drive and having too much understeer. Home hero Sergio Perez was a tenth further back in fifth, requiring a late flourish to vault ahead of the McLaren of Lando Norris and the Alfa Romeo of Valtteri Bottas. These two then slipped out of the top six when Carlos Sainz made a late improvement in the second Ferrari, with a lap which was still a full nine tenths off the impressive pace set by Russell. Yuki Tsunoda’s AlphaTauri and Alex Albon’s Williams rounded out the top 10, while Alpine could only manage 11th (Esteban Ocon) and 13th (Fernando Alonso) on what looked to be a very slippery track.

The technical dilemmas facing Ferrari and Red Bull in Mexico, https://racingnews365.com/the-technical-dilemmas-facing-ferrari-and-red-bull-in-mexico, The main peculiarity of the Mexico City circuit is the altitude at which it is located. In fact, the venue is 2250 metres above sea level, and this leads to a high rarefaction of the air, which is around 30 percent less dense compared to the air at sea level. In Austin, the performance of the car in practice and in qualifying passed with flying colours. From rumours gathered, however, it seems that their current situation is not entirely attributable to a deficit in aerodynamic balance, instead this can be constituted by a more rigid suspension set-up, adopted from mid-season. In practice, since Directive 39 was introduced, it would not be correct to say it directly affected the performance of the Ferrari F1-75, but it may have worsened their tyre management., The main peculiarity of the Mexico City circuit is the altitude at which it is located. In fact, the venue is 2250 metres above sea level, and this leads to a high rarefaction of the air, which is around 30 percent less dense compared to the air at sea level. The impact is relevant for many aspects, this affects the performance of the engines, the cooling of the power unit, the cooling of the brakes and, last but not least, the aerodynamic loads. The teams, consequently, adopt an aerodynamic configuration which replicates that of Monaco, but these aggressive wing configurations obtain a level of vertical load that is just over half of the downforce levels generated in the Principality. In these conditions, the evaluation of the effectiveness of some solutions is of significant importance. Ferrari's development opportunities It is interesting for the Ferrari engineers to evaluate the performance of their new floor, which arrived in Suzuka, in terms of the actual load produced by this new component. In Austin, the performance of the car in practice and in qualifying passed with flying colours. However, in the race, the balance shown was not as effective, revealing an excessive and rapid deterioration of the new tyres after a few laps. From rumours gathered, however, it seems that their current situation is not entirely attributable to a deficit in aerodynamic balance, instead this can be constituted by a more rigid suspension set-up, adopted from mid-season.

F1 Mexican GP: Russell leads Hamilton for Mercedes 1-2 in FP3, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/f1-mexican-gp-fp3-report-russell-hamilton-mercedes-1-2/10392326/, Charles Leclerc took fourth for Ferrari but ended up even further back from the dominant Mercedes pair, complaining about understeer aboard his F1-75. A few minutes later, Hamilton was the first of the frontrunners to emerge – his Mercedes fitted with softs from the off, as was the case for all his rivals. The Monegasque subsequently complained on his radio of “so much understeer” and that the car is “not turning at all”. Schumacher finished 17th after having another wild moment running hard over the kerbs at Turn 9 mid-way through the session, finishing behind Lance Stroll and Pierre Gasly. F1 Mexican Grand Prix free practice 3 results, Charles Leclerc took fourth for Ferrari but ended up even further back from the dominant Mercedes pair, complaining about understeer aboard his F1-75. If Ferrari can solve that, F1 may get a three-team fight for pole on Saturday at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, with Red Bull also needing to ease Verstappen’s path over the kerbs around the track that held him back in this session. Mercedes, conversely, looks to have a smoother build up towards qualifying with the W13s looking more planted in FP3 at a venue where the thin air at high altitude negates the impact of that package's extra drag, which is a hinderance at other circuits. As the one-hour session commenced, Valtteri Bottas led the pack out of the pits – the Alfa Romeo running the medium tyres for the initial laps – and he duly set the first place benchmark at 1m21.462s. A few minutes later, Hamilton was the first of the frontrunners to emerge – his Mercedes fitted with softs from the off, as was the case for all his rivals. Hamilton’s opening effort moved him into first place, although he had to beat Bottas’s second flying lap of his opening run that had brought the best time down to a 1m21.041s. With a 1m20.505s, Hamilton moved ahead – but only for a few seconds as Leclerc, looking to make up for his costly FP2 crash, was following closely behind and going quicker. Leclerc’s opening effort moved him into first on a 1m20.487s, which stood as the best time until the end of the first 10 minutes when Sainz slotted in ahead to break the 1m20s bracket on 1m19.884s. After Perez put in Red Bull’s first softs flier that left him 0.354s adrift before Leclerc’s second flying lap meant he squeezed in behind his team-mate, Russell produced a smooth opening effort to shoot to the top of the times on a 1m19.405s. After Mick Schumacher had spun off after hitting the kerbs too hard at Turn 10 – as Verstappen did in FP1 – and briefly come to a tyre-smoking stop in the runoff behind Turn 11, Verstappen emerged as the session’s opening third was about to end. As is so often the case with the world champion in practice sessions, he immediately went fastest with a 1m19.296s – but was unhappy with his handling over the kerbs at the first corners, as his RB18 had snapped left with oversteer exiting Turn 3. Mick Schumacher, Haas VF-22 Photo by: Sam Bloxham / Motorsport Images After a few cooldown laps and a trip through the pits, Verstappen completed his second flier on the softs – benefitting from a tow from Perez down the main straight, possibly foreshadowing tactics Red Bull will deploy in qualifying at a venue where that strategy badly backfired in 2021. Verstappen roared to a purple sector one and then although he lost a touch of time in the middle sector, he had enough tyre life left to improve the top time to a 1m19.118s. The flurry of fast times ended through the middle part of the session, where the Ferrari drivers – by this stage down to fourth and fifth in the standings – each completed a high-fuel race-data-gathering run on the softs. Just before the start of the final third, Russell rumbled back to the top spot with a 1m18.399s – to forge ahead of Verstappen by 0.7s with a sudden big gain that broke the pack into the 1m18s bracket for the first time. Hamilton was following just behind his team-mate and slotted into second 0.144s adrift, but did lose a chunk of time through the third sector having set the pace in the middle part of the lap. This was followed by a short lull in action with the majority of the cars in the pits and only Lando Norris circulating, before Verstappen was among those heading back out with just over 15 minutes remaining. The Dutchman started a third flier on the softs but abandoned it after going carefully and too slowly over the kerbs of the first corners and then having a small lock up into Turn 4 – after which he reported the “same problem again” regarding his problems over the early kerbs. Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB18 Photo by: Zak Mauger / Motorsport Images After another preparation lap, Verstappen went again on his latest set of softs and improved his personal best to close to 0.477s off Russell’s leading time, but remained third, with Perez also setting a personal best and moving into sixth – the home hero losing time with a lock-up and slide deep at Turn 13 in the stadium section. Just ahead of the final five minutes, Perez improved again to move up to fourth – albeit 0.842s slower than Russell – before the Ferrari drivers re-emerged for a final qualifying simulation run, with the leading Mercedes drivers and Verstappen back in the pits. Both Leclerc and Sainz improved here in the closing minutes, but only enough to jump the former ahead of Perez to take fourth 0.724s behind Russell, with Sainz taking sixth 0.902s down. The leaders did emerge with a few seconds of FP3 left to complete post-session practice starts, where Leclerc had enough time for one final flier that ended up being 0.4s off his personal best with no improvements in any sectors. The Monegasque subsequently complained on his radio of “so much understeer” and that the car is “not turning at all”. Norris ended up seventh behind Sainz, ahead of Bottas and Yuki Tsunoda, who had a brief off-track moment at Turn 1 later in the session. Schumacher finished 17th after having another wild moment running hard over the kerbs at Turn 9 mid-way through the session, finishing behind Lance Stroll and Pierre Gasly. Gasly improved from the foot of the times only late-on after struggling with oversteer in the early part of the lap that, at one stage in the final 10 minutes, had him catching a huge slide exiting Turn 4.

Wolff satisfied with ‘rigourous’ Cost Cap process as Shovlin calls Horner’s ‘draconian’ penalty claim ‘an exaggeration’, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.wolff-satisfied-with-rigourous-cost-cap-process-as-shovlin-calls-horners.7b2VoA9Ev2ghKwGezw96Kr.html, On Friday, Horner sat in front of the media to discuss his team’s penalties for breaching the Cost Cap. The team were given a fine of $7m and a further 10% reduction in allocated Restricted Wind Tunnel Testing and Restricted Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) limits. Horner said: “It’s a hit, it’s a handicap, and we are going to have to work incredibly hard. The teams, certainly we’re getting more efficient… I’m sure we’re not alone in that and it is quite a constraint. So whether the overspend is completely mitigated by the penalty, to be honest it depends how efficiently they develop going forward.”‘I don’t feel we need to apologise’ – Horner defiant after reaching cost cap breach agreement with FIA, Mercedes Trackside Engineering Director Andrew Shovlin has said that the penalty issued to Red Bull for breaching the Financial Regulations is not “draconian”, after Team Principal Christian Horner gave a press conference addressing the punishment on Friday. On Friday, Horner sat in front of the media to discuss his team’s penalties for breaching the Cost Cap. The team were given a fine of $7m and a further 10% reduction in allocated Restricted Wind Tunnel Testing and Restricted Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) limits. Horner said: “It’s a hit, it’s a handicap, and we are going to have to work incredibly hard. It gives an advantage to our competitors, which is why they were pushing so hard for a draconian penalty.” READ MORE: Horner on why he feels Red Bull’s Cost Cap breach penalties were ‘draconian’ – and why his team have accepted them Shovlin was asked for his opinion on the penalty on Saturday morning in Mexico City, and said: “I mean, the scale of that penalty isn’t much more than what you would lose if you’re just one place higher up in the championship, so it’s not as big as the penalty if you’re positioned two places higher. So, I think, describing it as ‘draconian’ is an exaggeration. Shovlin was speaking during Saturday’s team bosses press conference in Mexico City “Reducing the number of runs does limit your freedom when you’re developing a concept, but we’re in reasonably well-explored regulations now. But you definitely have to be more efficient. If it were half a second, which I’d heard mentioned, then a team at the back of the grid would have over three seconds’ advantage to one at the front, and that simply isn’t the case. “It depends on how well you make decisions early in the year; I’d have thought a tenth [of a second], a bit more than a tenth, maybe two-tenths at the upper end, is maybe more realistically what that would cost you.” READ MORE: 5 things we learned from Friday practice at the Mexico City Grand Prix On the wind tunnel penalty, Shovlin estimated that would cost “four or five runs” per week, and added: “Where it would be costly is if you’d chosen an incorrect concept and you need to backtrack: it’s removing that freedom to explore different avenues.” Max Verstappen and Red Bull recently secured both 2022 world titles, following on from the Dutchman’s triumph last season The Mercedes engineering chief added, however, that a breach of $400,000 – Red Bull having breached the Cap by $432,652 – could still make a difference to a team. “From an engineer’s point of view day in, day out, we’re making decisions of what we don’t do, that are of the orders of one, two, £3,000. That’s a normal part of our jobs. And we’re having to weigh up what we spend versus what performance it’s going to give us and we simply don’t have enough money; we’ve got to choose where it goes very carefully… The reality is money buys performance,” he commented. READ MORE: Home hero Perez expects ‘tough’ Mexico City qualifying battle after ‘tricky, tricky day’ “In terms of the cost of an update kit, that [$432,652] could easily be a major update kit.

So whether the overspend is completely mitigated by the penalty, to be honest it depends how efficiently they develop going forward.” ‘I don’t feel we need to apologise’ – Horner defiant after reaching cost cap breach agreement with FIA
Mercedes: Red Bull calling aero penalty ‘draconian’ is ‘an exaggeration’, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/mercedes-red-bull-calling-aero-penalty-draconian-is-an-exaggeration/10392307/, Red Bull F1 boss Christian Horner said the team had accepted the FIA’s proposed penalty begrudgingly, citing mitigating factors, but called the sanction “draconian” due to the impact on its car development for both 2023 and 2024. It means Red Bull will only get 63% of the windtunnel testing time that the team finishing seventh in this year’s championship will enjoy next year. Main rivals Ferrari and Mercedes should get 75% and 80% respectively, should they keep second and third in the standings. But you definitely have to be more efficient.”Christian Horner called Red Bull's cost cap penalty "draconian" but rivals teams have a different view. Speaking in the press conference, Alfa Romeo team boss Frederic Vasseur thought the bigger punishment for Red Bull was “in terms of image”, and was coy about the impact of the sporting penalty., Listen to this article Red Bull was hit with a $7 million fine and a 10% reduction in its aerodynamic testing allocation for the next 12 months after the FIA found it had breached the budget cap by £1.8m in 2021. Red Bull F1 boss Christian Horner said the team had accepted the FIA’s proposed penalty begrudgingly, citing mitigating factors, but called the sanction “draconian” due to the impact on its car development for both 2023 and 2024. It means Red Bull will only get 63% of the windtunnel testing time that the team finishing seventh in this year’s championship will enjoy next year. Main rivals Ferrari and Mercedes should get 75% and 80% respectively, should they keep second and third in the standings. Horner claimed the lack of aerodynamic testing could be worth between 0.25 seconds and half a second in terms of performance. But Mercedes trackside engineering director Andrew Shovlin felt the scale of the penalty “isn’t much more than what you would lose if you were just one place higher up in the championship.” “It’s not as big as the penalty if your position is two places higher,” said Shovlin during Saturday’s FIA press conference ahead of the Mexican Grand Prix. “So I think describing it as draconian is an exaggeration. “Reducing the number of runs does limit your freedom when developing a concept, but we’re in reasonably well-explored regulations now. But you definitely have to be more efficient.” Christian Horner called Red Bull's cost cap penalty "draconian" but rivals teams have a different view. Photo by: Carl Bingham / Motorsport Images Shovlin noted that if 10% of windtunnel time were really worth half a second, then “a team at the back of the grid would have a three second advantage to the one at the front, and that isn’t the case.” The team finishing 10th in this year’s championship will get 115% of P7’s windtunnel time next year. “It depends how well you make decisions through the year,” he said. “I would have thought a tenth, maybe two-tenths at the upper end, is realistically what that will cost you.” Asked how many windtunnel runs the 10% drop would cost Red Bull, Shovlin thought it “would only be about four or five runs different.” “I don’t know the exact number, I haven’t worked it out,” he said. “Where it would be costly is if you’ve chosen an incorrect concept and need to backtrack, it’s removing that freedom to explore different avenues.” The severity of the penalty has been questioned by a number of teams, including Ferrari, which said it would have a “very limited” impact on Red Bull, while McLaren team principal Andreas Seidl said he did not think the penalty fit the breach. Speaking in the press conference, Alfa Romeo team boss Frederic Vasseur thought the bigger punishment for Red Bull was “in terms of image”, and was coy about the impact of the sporting penalty. “If we speak about technical or sporting decision or penalty, it’s a bit different for me,” he said. “I’m not sure that we are making half a second with 10% of the allocation. Or we are very stupid.”
McLaren: Red Bull F1 cost cap penalty “not harsh enough”, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/mclaren-red-bull-f1-cost-cap-penalty-not-harsh-enough/10392259/, "But of course, from our point of view, if you look at the penalty, it just doesn't fit the breach. Seidl also downplayed Horner's explanations of why Red Bull went over the cap, although he insisted that he hadn't watched the Red Bull boss's press conference. McLaren CEO Zak Brown, who became embroiled in a war of words with Horner after writing a letter to the FIA calling for a strong punishment for Red Bull, echoed Seidl's sentiments. "There was a breach of the cost cap by one team, with the other nine operating in line with the rules. Alfa Romeo team principal Fred Vasseur cautioned that the Red Bull penalty might urge others to gamble on going over the cap., Listen to this article On Friday, the FIA announced that Red Bull had been fined $7m and docked 10% of its aero testing for the next 12 months, while Aston Martin was fined $450,000 for a procedural breach. Seidl stressed that it was encouraging to see that the FIA's process worked effectively, but he questioned the size of the penalties and urged that future sanctions should be harsher. "It's mixed feelings, to be honest," he told Motorsport.com. "I think on the positive side, it's actually good that we have confirmation that the audit process the FIA has done with all the teams has been done in a very thorough and diligent way. "And which in the end, also confirmed that one team was in breach. "It's positive as well, that actually a penalty has been applied, which hopefully, is in the end, good for the sport we're in, because it hopefully discourages teams in the future to go in the red zone, independent of if it's financial, sporting or technical regulations. "But of course, from our point of view, if you look at the penalty, it just doesn't fit the breach. So it's not harsh enough. And we obviously hope that moving forward for similar breaches, the penalties are a lot harsher." Asked about the impact of the aero reduction, he said: "Of course, 10% makes a difference on the development side. But again, if you compare it with the breach, it just doesn't fit the breach." Seidl also downplayed Horner's explanations of why Red Bull went over the cap, although he insisted that he hadn't watched the Red Bull boss's press conference. "I didn't watch it," he said. "I didn't like fairy tales as a kid. That's why I wasn't interested to listen to Christian's press conference today! "I think, as the findings of the FIA have confirmed for all 10 teams, in the end it's a confirmation that the budget cap works. "Nine teams managed to stay within the cap, and as far as I understand also managed to get close to the cap, which was the idea of the introduction of the budget cap. "And therefore I guess, from my point of view, it will be completely wrong to blame room for interpretations or whatever happened there." McLaren CEO Zak Brown, who became embroiled in a war of words with Horner after writing a letter to the FIA calling for a strong punishment for Red Bull, echoed Seidl's sentiments. Zak Brown, CEO, McLaren Racing, Andreas Seidl, Team Principal, McLaren Photo by: Glenn Dunbar / Motorsport Images "I'm pleased the truth is out there now and it is the result is as we expected," said the American. "There was a breach of the cost cap by one team, with the other nine operating in line with the rules. "It is therefore only right that punitive action is taken. If the FIA is to be most effective and its punishments serve as a lesson to others when rules are broken in this way, the sanctions have to be much stronger in the future. 'We hope that the lessons learned through this process will now mean all teams have a clear understanding of the rules in order to avoid any future breaches. "While we are pleased to see them act, we would hope the FIA take stronger action in future against those that wilfully break the rules." Haas principal Gunther Steiner agreed that neither the fine nor the aero testing penalty was strong enough. "The money doesn't mean anything to the other teams, it's good for the FIA to get money!," he told Motorsport.com. "The 10% wind tunnel cut doesn't mean a lot, because there is not a real penalty. Yeah, you do less wind tunnel, but you can do something else. It's as simple as this. "What they need to do is give a penalty in money, a reduction of the budget cap basically, in dollars, that would make much more sense than 10% wind tunnel." Steiner agreed that the late timing of the decision wasn't helpful for any team. "That's the next problem. We need to have these things before. I mean, we cannot wait until September, we need to have them in June." Alfa Romeo team principal Fred Vasseur cautioned that the Red Bull penalty might urge others to gamble on going over the cap. "It's quite a small penalty on the sporting side from my point of view," he said. "And we have to be sure that these won't encourage teams to overspend in the future, because everybody will do his own calculation to know if it makes sense to spend X millions more one year and to have a 10% less wind tunnel allocation. "I'm not in this case and it's not an issue for me. And I don't have the choice, but I'm putting myself in their position." Regarding Horner's emphasis on conflicting interpretations of the rules, he said: "You don't have to underestimate also the fact that it was difficult, it was a challenge. However, we were allowed to ask questions. We all asked I think something like couple of thousand questions altogether."

The FIA announced on Friday that Red Bull has been fined $7m and hit with a 10% reduction in aero testing for the next 12 months after being found guilty of exceeding last year's budget cap. The fact that debate over the disputed 2021 items intensified in the past few weeks – with the 2022 season nearly over – has inevitably provoked speculation that it may be too late for the team to change its approach and stay under this year's cap. However, Horner says that many of the issues related to the team's 2021 spend won't be factors in the 2022 accounts. "The effects that we've had this year, the material effect that they carry over into 2022, a lot of these costs are one-off costs," he said when asked by Motorsport.com about this year's spending. "Whether it was a redundancy cost, leaver costs, sick pay, they are one-off costs. We will continue to feed our people, and their costs will be apportioned within the cap." Christian Horner, Team Principal, Red Bull Racing, in a press conference regarding the recent findings of the cost cap breach. The FIA have handed Red Bull a $7m fine and an aero testing reduction Photo by: Carl Bingham / Motorsport Images Horner insisted that he believes that rival teams have spent more in key areas such as development and crash damage this year. "If I look at the 2022 rate of development, I think that other teams have put significantly more components on the car than us this year. "If you look at crash damage alone, which again, is hugely expensive, and something I think that needs personally looking at within the cap - when you look at the quantum of some of the crashes this year, some of which are not the fault of your driver or your team, Max Verstappen is the driver that has incurred the least amount of damage this year. In terms of parts used, again, we are at the lower end. "So one can never say with 100% confidence that we're comfortably within the cap, particularly after the process that we've just been through. "But we feel that there are a lot of one-off costs that have been included within this. And we are confident and hopeful that with the process of these regulations being tidied up for future, it will become less of an accounting world championship." Asked about likely penalties for future breaches by teams, Horner suggested that several of his rivals could go over the limit this year. "I think what we have set is a precedent," he said. "And it sets a precedent for 2022. And a danger for 2022 is that there could be six teams in breach of the cap. Energy prices have been exponential, but thankfully we've been protected from that. "But there is that chance that several teams, many of which have stated it during F1 commission meetings, will break the cap this year. "We do not believe that we will break the cap in 2022, for the reasons I explained earlier. But these penalties set precedent for the future. So if you get 10% for 0.37% breach, what is the 5% breach going to be?"

Lewis Hamilton and Michael Schumacher's titles have “less value” than Max Verstappen's says Fernando Alonso | F1 ..., https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1015873/1/alonso-verstappen-titles-better-hamilton-s-or-schumacher-s, Verstappen won his first F1 championship by edging Hamilton at the controversial 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and has claimed the 2022 title amid Red Bull’s F1 cost cap saga. Lewis Hamilton VS Fernando Alonso - THE RIVALRY! | F1 2022 Video of Lewis Hamilton VS Fernando Alonso - THE RIVALRY! Alonso later said via social media, about his own previous comments: "Please, all the titles are amazing, well deserved and inspiring. Verstappen will begin the F1 Mexico City Grand Prix in pole position ahead of the Mercedes duo, with Alonso ninth., Verstappen won his first F1 championship by edging Hamilton at the controversial 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and has claimed the 2022 title amid Red Bull’s F1 cost cap saga. Hamilton and Schumacher hold the all-time joint record for the most championships. Lewis Hamilton VS Fernando Alonso - THE RIVALRY! | F1 2022 Video of Lewis Hamilton VS Fernando Alonso - THE RIVALRY! | F1 2022 "I have a lot of respect for Lewis, but still it is different when you win seven world titles when you only had to fight with your teammate," two-time champion Alonso told De Telegraaf. "Then I think a championship has less value than when you have fewer titles but have had to fight against other drivers with equal or even better material. "In 2005 and 2006, I had a good start to the year myself and was able to create a lead. Then others might have had a better car, but I was able to manage that gap. "I never had to fight with my teammate to win those titles. Nor did I see Max fighting with Sergio Perez or Alex Albon to win races. "But Schumacher in particular fought with his teammate to become champion five times in a row and Hamilton fought with Nico Rosberg and Valtteri Bottas. That's different, I think." Hamilton’s teammate in his first F1 season was Alonso and they have endured a tumultuous relationship, of which the latest chapter came at this year’s Belgian Grand Prix when they collided and the Spaniard called the Brit “an idiot”. Alonso later said via social media, about his own previous comments: "Please, all the titles are amazing, well deserved and inspiring. Incomparable to each other and let’s enjoy champions and legends of our current time." Alonso was the F1 champion in 2005 and 2006 with Renault. Hamilton battled with Mercedes teammate Rosberg for three seasons in particular, winning the championship in two of those. Bottas, also Hamilton’s teammate, finished behind him in 2019 and 2020. Verstappen has won this year by seeing off Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc who is second in the F1 standings. Verstappen will begin the F1 Mexico City Grand Prix in pole position ahead of the Mercedes duo, with Alonso ninth.
F1 teams bring tech updates to manage Mexico’s high-altitude challenge, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/f1-tech-updates-mexico-high-altitude-challenge/10391984/, The Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez sits at 2.2km above sea level, comfortably making it the highest altitude race of the season. The next-highest track that F1 visits is Interlagos in Brazil, which stands at just 700m. Of the 10 new updates for teams detailed by the FIA in its usual pre-race technical document, just two of them were not related to improving cooling for the demands of the track in Mexico. Daniel Ricciardo, McLaren MCL36, leaves the garage Photo by: Steven Tee / Motorsport ImagesAlphaTauri has opted for three cooling-related upgrades for Mexico. Williams also has some new cooling louvres for this event but said it would “only be used if required” given the detrimental impact on aerodynamic performance., Listen to this article With the 2022 season winding to a close and the majority of teams now fully focused on developments for next year, few are bringing many new parts to races. But there has been a big focus on cooling for this weekend’s Mexican Grand Prix as teams look to get on top of the high-altitude conditions that make it a race unlike any other. The Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez sits at 2.2km above sea level, comfortably making it the highest altitude race of the season. The next-highest track that F1 visits is Interlagos in Brazil, which stands at just 700m. The thinner air and lack of oxygen means that teams face an increased challenge to keep their cars cool and prevent any overheating issues that could force unwanted retirements or problems. Of the 10 new updates for teams detailed by the FIA in its usual pre-race technical document, just two of them were not related to improving cooling for the demands of the track in Mexico. McLaren is running with some additional winglets on its rear brake duct assembly of the MCL36 car in a bid to increase local suction and therefore downforce on the rear corner assembly. The only other performance upgrade comes courtesy of Aston Martin, which has adjusted the design of the lower edge of the rear deflector with the aim of improving flow towards the rear of the floor. Red Bull has enlarged the design of the top-body central spine on the engine cover, revising the exit geometry so there is an increased cooling capacity within the area. Along with its new rear brake duct winglets, McLaren informed the FIA of three cooling upgrades for this weekend, adding more slots in the engine cover, installing some more cooling louvres and adjusting the coke exit gurney to increase airflow through the rear of the car. Daniel Ricciardo, McLaren MCL36, leaves the garage Photo by: Steven Tee / Motorsport Images AlphaTauri has opted for three cooling-related upgrades for Mexico. The exit area of the front brakeduct scoop has been enlarged on each of the front corners, improving airflow through to the brake disc and calliper. It has also introduced some new cooling louvres, as well as opting for a redesign of the engine cover, enlarging the cooling exit by using a flatter and wider top deck that should again help rear airflow. Williams also has some new cooling louvres for this event but said it would “only be used if required” given the detrimental impact on aerodynamic performance. Besides cooling updates, Alfa Romeo informed the FIA that it had brought an update floor to this event with a reprofiled front geometry and modified cuts outs, although this was first spotted in Austin. Mercedes also submitted that it had a new floor edge detail for Mexico, although this was only to be used as a test item on an older specification of floor for Nyck de Vries’ car in FP1. On top of the cooling challenge that teams face in Mexico, the high altitude means all teams will be running high downforce packages this weekend in a bid to improve grip, with drag being far less of a problem due to the thinner air.
FIA set to reduce use of F1 black-and-orange flag warnings, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/fia-reduce-use-of-black-and-orange-flag-warnings-after-2022-controversies/10391934/, The black-and-orange flag is used as an instruction to competitors ordering them to pit for repairs if they suffer damage and their continued participation is deemed unsafe, with drivers required to come in at the end of the lap after they receive the warning. This followed Haas driver Kevin Magnussen receiving the black-and-orange flag instruction at three races earlier in 2022 – Canada, Hungary and Singapore – after he sustained damage to his front wing endplate in each of those races that left the part waving loose. This was deemed unsafe by the FIA officials at those races and he duly came in for repairs. In the announcement that Alonso’s Austin penalty had been annulled, it was revealed that FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem had initiated a review into the future use of the black-and-orange flag. Motorsport.com understands that this has been enacted in unanimous agreement with the F1 teams and follows the Austin stewards declaring that they were “concerned” that Alonso was allowed to continuing circulating with his wing mirror hanging loose., Listen to this article Instead, the onus will be on the teams to ensure their cars remain operating in a safe manner even after sustaining damage in incidents and then prove this is the case to in-competition enquiries raised by the governing body. The black-and-orange flag is used as an instruction to competitors ordering them to pit for repairs if they suffer damage and their continued participation is deemed unsafe, with drivers required to come in at the end of the lap after they receive the warning. Its use in the 2022 season has made headlines since the 2022 US Grand Prix after the Haas team protested the results of Red Bull’s Sergio Perez and Alpine driver Fernando Alonso because it believed they had each finished the race while running with damage, contravening safety rules. This followed Haas driver Kevin Magnussen receiving the black-and-orange flag instruction at three races earlier in 2022 – Canada, Hungary and Singapore – after he sustained damage to his front wing endplate in each of those races that left the part waving loose. This was deemed unsafe by the FIA officials at those races and he duly came in for repairs. But Haas was incensed, feeling it is being treated differently to other teams in this matter, when this did not happen for Perez in the race at Austin (his damaged endplate fell off five laps after his opening tour contact with Alfa Romeo driver Valtteri Bottas) and Alonso finished the race despite running for several laps with his right-side wing mirror bouncing loose and then falling off. Haas’s protest against Perez was dismissed because Red Bull had supplied photos to the FIA to show the shorn endplate damage was not moving unsafely, which the FIA accepted and the stewards’ agreed with that call. But the American squad’s protest against Alonso was initially found to be admissible and he was later handed a 30-second time addition that cost him his seventh-place finish last weekend. Fernando Alonso, Alpine A522, collides with Lance Stroll, Aston Martin AMR22 Photo by: Carl Bingham / Motorsport Images That was later rescinded following a long saga into the decisions around why Haas’s protest was allowed to proceed in the first place. In the announcement that Alonso’s Austin penalty had been annulled, it was revealed that FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem had initiated a review into the future use of the black-and-orange flag. Motorsport.com understands that this has been enacted in unanimous agreement with the F1 teams and follows the Austin stewards declaring that they were “concerned” that Alonso was allowed to continuing circulating with his wing mirror hanging loose. This is central to the controversy of the use of the black-and-orange flag in 2022, as the incidents involving Magnussen follow the wording of the rule around its usage in the FIA’s sporting code, but confusion and anger has followed after it was not shown to Alonso at the Circuit of The Americas. The FIA’s International Sporting Code on the flag’s usage states: “This flag should be used to inform the driver concerned that his car has mechanical problems likely to endanger himself or others and means that he must stop at his pit on the next lap. “When the mechanical problems have been rectified to the satisfaction of the chief scrutineer, the car may rejoin the race.” The black-and-orange flag usage was discussed at a meeting of the F1 team managers at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez track ahead of opening practice for the 2022 Mexico City GP on Friday. The ongoing discussion concerns how the flag will be used at coming events, with the understanding that officials will now be less inclined to automatically give the warning as F1 teams have so much data to prove a part, even if damaged, is not going to suddenly become a safety problem. This leaves F1 in a different arrangement with other categories covered by the ISC, where the corresponding lack of data means drivers may be running unaware they have damage and so the onus is on race officials to get them to stop for repairs to ensure safety. It is understood that no rule changes for F1 are planned as a result of the FIA review, with the governing body instead set to leave the onus on the teams to ensure their cars are running in safe manners at all times – although it will step in and make immediate enquiries in cases where damage is clearly visible. One problem with this approach could be where disagreements arise in how safe damaged cars continue to be following incidents such as Alonso’s with Lance Stroll at Austin, with competitors naturally inclined to push the limit of the rules and other teams likely to object to gain a competitive edge.
F1 results: George Russell fastest in Mexican GP practice for Mercedes, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/f1-results-fastest-mexican-gp-practice-russell/10391857/, But Russell set the time on 2022-spec soft tyres, as he didn’t run in FP1, so it was a competitively legitimate lap. Mexican Grand Prix FP1 results: Sainz fastest from LeclercWhat happened in Mexican GP Free Practice 1? Two-time champion Max Verstappen set the early pace at 1m23.292s on hard tyres, six tenths clear of Red Bull stablemate, and local hero, Sergio Perez. Mexican Grand Prix FP2 results: Russell fastest from TsunodaWhat happened in Mexican GP Free Practice 2? Hamilton was fastest on the test tyres, over 1.5s off Russell’s pace, and less than a tenth clear of Perez and Verstappen., Listen to this article Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz was fastest in FP1 before Russell topped FP2, which doubled as a 2023 Pirelli prototype tyre test and so was unrepresentative in the main. But Russell set the time on 2022-spec soft tyres, as he didn’t run in FP1, so it was a competitively legitimate lap. Mexican Grand Prix FP1 results: Sainz fastest from Leclerc What happened in Mexican GP Free Practice 1? Two-time champion Max Verstappen set the early pace at 1m23.292s on hard tyres, six tenths clear of Red Bull stablemate, and local hero, Sergio Perez. Verstappen lowered that to 1m22.779s before Perez briefly nicked P1 off him with 1m22.702s to the home crowd’s delight. Verstappen then worked down to 1m22.291s, 0.382s ahead of Perez. Sainz was best of the rest for Ferrari on the hards, half a second off, while teammate Charles Leclerc was first to run on softs. Leclerc duly leapt to the top with 1m21.546s, and then improved to 1m20.753s on his second push lap. Verstappen was on course to beat Leclerc when he spun at the Esses, while Sainz did manage to pip his teammate with 1m20.707s, the fastest time of the session. Perez and Verstappen set exactly the same laptime on softs, 0.12s off the pace, with the Mercedes of Lewis Hamilton in fifth, a further 0.02s in arrears, with another 0.05s back to Fernando Alonso’s Alpine. There were plenty of incidents: On a dusty track early on, Williams’ FP1 rookie Logan Sargeant ran wide on the entry to the Foro Sol stadium section, while Alonso also briefly went off track in the Esses. The session was red flagged with 22 minutes remaining when Pietro Fittipaldi’s Haas ground to a smoky halt at Turn 2 on an out lap. Meantime, Zhou Guanyu’s Alfa Romeo needed retrieving from the end of the pit lane when his gearbox failed to upshift. Of the FP1 rookies, AlphaTauri’s Liam Lawson was fastest in 16th but had a moment and visited the escape road at Ese del Lago. In the closing minutes of the session he caused a red flag when his car suffered a technical failure and, as he didn’t have time to cool the brakes, the front-left corner caught fire. Sargeant was 17th, ahead of Nyck de Vries in his final outing for Mercedes. Jack Doohan (Alpine) hit engine trouble on his way to 19th, with Fittipaldi only managing nine laps before his day also ended early. Mexican Grand Prix FP2 results: Russell fastest from Tsunoda What happened in Mexican GP Free Practice 2? As in Austin last weekend, FP2 was a lengthened 90-minute 2023 Pirelli prototype tyre test for the majority of runners. Only those who skipped FP1, due to rookie drivers taking their place, got to run as normal. AlphaTauri’s Pierre Gasly set the early bar at 1m22.186s before Sainz lapped in 1m21.943s. Mercedes’ George Russell was back in for this session, taking over from de Vries, and leapt to the top of the times on 1m21.742s on mediums. After a Red Bull interlude – Verstappen took P1 with 1m21.588s, before Perez pipped him by 0.009s on 1m21.579s – Russell switched to softs and unleashed 1m19.970s. Yuki Tsunoda was second quickest for AlphaTauri, ahead of Alpine’s Esteban Ocon – both also on the 2022 softs. Just after the 30-minute mark Leclerc crashed heavily on the exit of Turn 8, backing his Ferrari backwards into the barriers. Hamilton was fastest on the test tyres, over 1.5s off Russell’s pace, and less than a tenth clear of Perez and Verstappen. The session ended two minutes early when Zhou pulled off with a hydraulic failure in the Foro Sol.
Mexico City Grand Prix: Ferrari 'not happy' with size of Red Bull budget cap penalty, https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/63438890, The Mexico City Grand Prix is live on 5 Live and the BBC Sport websiteFerrari say they are "not happy" with the penalty imposed on rivals Red Bull for breaking Formula 1's budget cap. F1's governing body the FIA said on Friday Red Bull had breached the cap in 2021 by £1.86m and imposed a $7m fine and 10% cut in aerodynamic research. Ferrari racing director Laurent Mekies said Red Bull's breach was "a significant amount" and that "the real effect of the penalty is very limited". Red Bull team boss Christian Horner described the penalty as "draconian". "Furthermore, there is another problem in that, since there is no budget cap reduction in the penalty, the basic effect is to push the competitor to spend the money elsewhere., The Mexico City Grand Prix is live on 5 Live and the BBC Sport website Ferrari say they are "not happy" with the penalty imposed on rivals Red Bull for breaking Formula 1's budget cap. F1's governing body the FIA said on Friday Red Bull had breached the cap in 2021 by £1.86m and imposed a $7m fine and 10% cut in aerodynamic research. Ferrari racing director Laurent Mekies said Red Bull's breach was "a significant amount" and that "the real effect of the penalty is very limited". Red Bull team boss Christian Horner described the penalty as "draconian". Horner claimed that the effect of the aerodynamic reduction on Red Bull's car "represents between 0.25secs and 0.5secs of lap time - it comes in from now and will be in place for a 12-month period". Horner also pointed to a line in the FIA judgement that said had Red Bull applied the correct treatment to a notional tax credit, the team would have exceeded the cap by only £432,652. This, he said, reduced the overspend from 1.6% to 0.37%. But Mekies questioned Horner's assessment of the net impact of the penalty. In an interview with Sky Sports Italia, he said: "We at Ferrari think that this amount (of overspend) is worth around a couple of tenths (per lap), and so it's easy to understand that these figures can have a real impact on the outcome of the races and maybe even a championship. "As for the penalty, we are not happy with it, for two important reasons. The first is that we at Ferrari do not understand how the 10% reduction of the ATA (aerodynamic research allowance) can correspond to the same amount of lap time that we mentioned earlier. "Furthermore, there is another problem in that, since there is no budget cap reduction in the penalty, the basic effect is to push the competitor to spend the money elsewhere. 'People choose narrative that suits' - Horner on budget cap fine "It has total freedom to use the money it can no longer spend on use of the wind tunnel and CFD due to the 10% reduction, on reducing the weight of the car or who knows what else. "Our concern is that the combination of these two factors means the real effect of the penalty is very limited." Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff told Sky Sports: "Overall, it's good to see that there is a penalty, whether we deem it too low or too high. "I think what you see is that beyond a sporting penalty and financial fine, it's also reputational damage," Wolff said. "In a world of transparency and good governance, that's just not on anymore." Mekies' comments follow those from McLaren Racing chief executive officer Zak Brown, who told BBC Sport on Friday: "If the FIA is to be most effective and its punishments serve as a lesson to others when rules are broken in this way, the sanctions have to be much stronger in the future." Horner said in an interview with BBC Sport: "For a 0.37% overspend, I think a 10% reduction is pretty draconian, that's worth potentially quarter to half a second of a season's development, has an impact on our performance next year and makes our challenge even greater as we head into 2023. It's applicable from now so it affects next year's car. "Anyone who diminished that penalty is uneducated in terms of what the actual value of it in terms of performance." He added that the lost time was "an enormous handicap". Horner said: "We didn't spend one penny of this money on making the car go faster." He added: "The FIA have been harsh, they stand by their budget cap, it was important for them. "I believe in now drawing a line under it, take the hit, performance hit. We're going to have to work harder and smart within the time we have in the winter, which is our primary development time." He rejected suggestions that Red Bull driver Max Verstappen should be stripped of last year's title, won in controversial circumstances at the final race of the season after a tight battle with Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton. "We feel we've been chastised enough," he said. "We feel the public slating we had through mud being slung by some of our competitors is penalty enough. "Time to move on - Verstappen is 2021 World Champion, our focus is very much now on (this weekend's) Mexican Grand Prix and trying to finish the season off in a high." And he denied that there was now an asterisk against Verstappen's first title, won after the race director applied the rules incorrectly during a late safety-car period in the final race of the season and in a year in which his team had broken the rules on spending. "Absolutely not," Horner said. "Last year went down in history as one of the most titanic battles in F1 history. Verstappen was a hugely deserving champion. Inevitably there will be partisan support on either side but the reality is he did the job, he won the race at the final Grand Prix of the year and 2021 is now confined to the history books. "People will choose a narrative at the end of the day. I think Max did absolutely nothing wrong last year. He won the race fair and square, as a team we performed out of our skin to break the domination of one team that has dominated in the last seven years, nothing can diminish from what he did last year and that's obviously backed up again in 2022."
Horner believes Red Bull won’t breach 2022 F1 cost cap, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/horner-believes-red-bull-wont-breach-2022-f1-cost-cap/10392047/, Listen to this articleHowever, he admits he can't say with "100% confidence" that Red Bull will be safe, and suggests that six teams are still at risk of breaching the 2022 cap limit. However, Horner says that many of the issues related to the team's 2021 spend won't be factors in the 2022 accounts. Christian Horner, Team Principal, Red Bull Racing, in a press conference regarding the recent findings of the cost cap breach. And a danger for 2022 is that there could be six teams in breach of the cap. "We do not believe that we will break the cap in 2022, for the reasons I explained earlier., Listen to this article However, he admits he can't say with "100% confidence" that Red Bull will be safe, and suggests that six teams are still at risk of breaching the 2022 cap limit. The FIA announced on Friday that Red Bull has been fined $7m and hit with a 10% reduction in aero testing for the next 12 months after being found guilty of exceeding last year's budget cap. The fact that debate over the disputed 2021 items intensified in the past few weeks – with the 2022 season nearly over – has inevitably provoked speculation that it may be too late for the team to change its approach and stay under this year's cap. However, Horner says that many of the issues related to the team's 2021 spend won't be factors in the 2022 accounts. "The effects that we've had this year, the material effect that they carry over into 2022, a lot of these costs are one-off costs," he said when asked by Motorsport.com about this year's spending. "Whether it was a redundancy cost, leaver costs, sick pay, they are one-off costs. We will continue to feed our people, and their costs will be apportioned within the cap."

The FIA have handed Red Bull a $7m fine and an aero testing reduction Photo by: Carl Bingham / Motorsport Images Horner insisted that he believes that rival teams have spent more in key areas such as development and crash damage this year. "If I look at the 2022 rate of development, I think that other teams have put significantly more components on the car than us this year. "If you look at crash damage alone, which again, is hugely expensive, and something I think that needs personally looking at within the cap - when you look at the quantum of some of the crashes this year, some of which are not the fault of your driver or your team, Max Verstappen is the driver that has incurred the least amount of damage this year. In terms of parts used, again, we are at the lower end. "So one can never say with 100% confidence that we're comfortably within the cap, particularly after the process that we've just been through. "But we feel that there are a lot of one-off costs that have been included within this. And we are confident and hopeful that with the process of these regulations being tidied up for future, it will become less of an accounting world championship." Asked about likely penalties for future breaches by teams, Horner suggested that several of his rivals could go over the limit this year. "I think what we have set is a precedent," he said. "And it sets a precedent for 2022. And a danger for 2022 is that there could be six teams in breach of the cap. Energy prices have been exponential, but thankfully we've been protected from that. "But there is that chance that several teams, many of which have stated it during F1 commission meetings, will break the cap this year. "We do not believe that we will break the cap in 2022, for the reasons I explained earlier. But these penalties set precedent for the future. So if you get 10% for 0.37% breach, what is the 5% breach going to be?"

"When you get something done you can then focus on the next thing. This is an important decision for the team, and there is enough to focus on [elsewhere] to get better." Kevin Magnussen is signed up by Haas long-term. The team have publicly considered Daniel Ricciardo as a replacement for Schumacher but the veteran Australian closed the door on the possibility. Nico Hulkenberg remains in the frame to get the nod. Schumacher is 16th in the F1 standings entering the F1 Mexico City Grand Prix. He will start the race in 16th.
F1 teams bring tech updates to manage Mexico’s high-altitude challenge, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/f1-tech-updates-mexico-high-altitude-challenge/10391984/, The Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez sits at 2.2km above sea level, comfortably making it the highest altitude race of the season. The next-highest track that F1 visits is Interlagos in Brazil, which stands at just 700m. Of the 10 new updates for teams detailed by the FIA in its usual pre-race technical document, just two of them were not related to improving cooling for the demands of the track in Mexico. Daniel Ricciardo, McLaren MCL36, leaves the garage Photo by: Steven Tee / Motorsport ImagesAlphaTauri has opted for three cooling-related upgrades for Mexico. Williams also has some new cooling louvres for this event but said it would “only be used if required” given the detrimental impact on aerodynamic performance., Listen to this article With the 2022 season winding to a close and the majority of teams now fully focused on developments for next year, few are bringing many new parts to races. But there has been a big focus on cooling for this weekend’s Mexican Grand Prix as teams look to get on top of the high-altitude conditions that make it a race unlike any other. The Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez sits at 2.2km above sea level, comfortably making it the highest altitude race of the season. The next-highest track that F1 visits is Interlagos in Brazil, which stands at just 700m. The thinner air and lack of oxygen means that teams face an increased challenge to keep their cars cool and prevent any overheating issues that could force unwanted retirements or problems. Of the 10 new updates for teams detailed by the FIA in its usual pre-race technical document, just two of them were not related to improving cooling for the demands of the track in Mexico. McLaren is running with some additional winglets on its rear brake duct assembly of the MCL36 car in a bid to increase local suction and therefore downforce on the rear corner assembly. The only other performance upgrade comes courtesy of Aston Martin, which has adjusted the design of the lower edge of the rear deflector with the aim of improving flow towards the rear of the floor. Red Bull has enlarged the design of the top-body central spine on the engine cover, revising the exit geometry so there is an increased cooling capacity within the area. Along with its new rear brake duct winglets, McLaren informed the FIA of three cooling upgrades for this weekend, adding more slots in the engine cover, installing some more cooling louvres and adjusting the coke exit gurney to increase airflow through the rear of the car. Daniel Ricciardo, McLaren MCL36, leaves the garage Photo by: Steven Tee / Motorsport Images AlphaTauri has opted for three cooling-related upgrades for Mexico. The exit area of the front brakeduct scoop has been enlarged on each of the front corners, improving airflow through to the brake disc and calliper. It has also introduced some new cooling louvres, as well as opting for a redesign of the engine cover, enlarging the cooling exit by using a flatter and wider top deck that should again help rear airflow. Williams also has some new cooling louvres for this event but said it would “only be used if required” given the detrimental impact on aerodynamic performance. Besides cooling updates, Alfa Romeo informed the FIA that it had brought an update floor to this event with a reprofiled front geometry and modified cuts outs, although this was first spotted in Austin. Mercedes also submitted that it had a new floor edge detail for Mexico, although this was only to be used as a test item on an older specification of floor for Nyck de Vries’ car in FP1. On top of the cooling challenge that teams face in Mexico, the high altitude means all teams will be running high downforce packages this weekend in a bid to improve grip, with drag being far less of a problem due to the thinner air.
FIA set to reduce use of F1 black-and-orange flag warnings, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/fia-reduce-use-of-black-and-orange-flag-warnings-after-2022-controversies/10391934/, The black-and-orange flag is used as an instruction to competitors ordering them to pit for repairs if they suffer damage and their continued participation is deemed unsafe, with drivers required to come in at the end of the lap after they receive the warning. This followed Haas driver Kevin Magnussen receiving the black-and-orange flag instruction at three races earlier in 2022 – Canada, Hungary and Singapore – after he sustained damage to his front wing endplate in each of those races that left the part waving loose. This was deemed unsafe by the FIA officials at those races and he duly came in for repairs. In the announcement that Alonso’s Austin penalty had been annulled, it was revealed that FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem had initiated a review into the future use of the black-and-orange flag. Motorsport.com understands that this has been enacted in unanimous agreement with the F1 teams and follows the Austin stewards declaring that they were “concerned” that Alonso was allowed to continuing circulating with his wing mirror hanging loose., Listen to this article Instead, the onus will be on the teams to ensure their cars remain operating in a safe manner even after sustaining damage in incidents and then prove this is the case to in-competition enquiries raised by the governing body. The black-and-orange flag is used as an instruction to competitors ordering them to pit for repairs if they suffer damage and their continued participation is deemed unsafe, with drivers required to come in at the end of the lap after they receive the warning. Its use in the 2022 season has made headlines since the 2022 US Grand Prix after the Haas team protested the results of Red Bull’s Sergio Perez and Alpine driver Fernando Alonso because it believed they had each finished the race while running with damage, contravening safety rules. This followed Haas driver Kevin Magnussen receiving the black-and-orange flag instruction at three races earlier in 2022 – Canada, Hungary and Singapore – after he sustained damage to his front wing endplate in each of those races that left the part waving loose. This was deemed unsafe by the FIA officials at those races and he duly came in for repairs. But Haas was incensed, feeling it is being treated differently to other teams in this matter, when this did not happen for Perez in the race at Austin (his damaged endplate fell off five laps after his opening tour contact with Alfa Romeo driver Valtteri Bottas) and Alonso finished the race despite running for several laps with his right-side wing mirror bouncing loose and then falling off. Haas’s protest against Perez was dismissed because Red Bull had supplied photos to the FIA to show the shorn endplate damage was not moving unsafely, which the FIA accepted and the stewards’ agreed with that call. But the American squad’s protest against Alonso was initially found to be admissible and he was later handed a 30-second time addition that cost him his seventh-place finish last weekend. Fernando Alonso, Alpine A522, collides with Lance Stroll, Aston Martin AMR22 Photo by: Carl Bingham / Motorsport Images That was later rescinded following a long saga into the decisions around why Haas’s protest was allowed to proceed in the first place. In the announcement that Alonso’s Austin penalty had been annulled, it was revealed that FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem had initiated a review into the future use of the black-and-orange flag. Motorsport.com understands that this has been enacted in unanimous agreement with the F1 teams and follows the Austin stewards declaring that they were “concerned” that Alonso was allowed to continuing circulating with his wing mirror hanging loose. This is central to the controversy of the use of the black-and-orange flag in 2022, as the incidents involving Magnussen follow the wording of the rule around its usage in the FIA’s sporting code, but confusion and anger has followed after it was not shown to Alonso at the Circuit of The Americas. The FIA’s International Sporting Code on the flag’s usage states: “This flag should be used to inform the driver concerned that his car has mechanical problems likely to endanger himself or others and means that he must stop at his pit on the next lap. “When the mechanical problems have been rectified to the satisfaction of the chief scrutineer, the car may rejoin the race.” The black-and-orange flag usage was discussed at a meeting of the F1 team managers at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez track ahead of opening practice for the 2022 Mexico City GP on Friday. The ongoing discussion concerns how the flag will be used at coming events, with the understanding that officials will now be less inclined to automatically give the warning as F1 teams have so much data to prove a part, even if damaged, is not going to suddenly become a safety problem. This leaves F1 in a different arrangement with other categories covered by the ISC, where the corresponding lack of data means drivers may be running unaware they have damage and so the onus is on race officials to get them to stop for repairs to ensure safety. It is understood that no rule changes for F1 are planned as a result of the FIA review, with the governing body instead set to leave the onus on the teams to ensure their cars are running in safe manners at all times – although it will step in and make immediate enquiries in cases where damage is clearly visible. One problem with this approach could be where disagreements arise in how safe damaged cars continue to be following incidents such as Alonso’s with Lance Stroll at Austin, with competitors naturally inclined to push the limit of the rules and other teams likely to object to gain a competitive edge.
F1 results: George Russell fastest in Mexican GP practice for Mercedes, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/f1-results-fastest-mexican-gp-practice-russell/10391857/, But Russell set the time on 2022-spec soft tyres, as he didn’t run in FP1, so it was a competitively legitimate lap. Mexican Grand Prix FP1 results: Sainz fastest from LeclercWhat happened in Mexican GP Free Practice 1? Two-time champion Max Verstappen set the early pace at 1m23.292s on hard tyres, six tenths clear of Red Bull stablemate, and local hero, Sergio Perez. Mexican Grand Prix FP2 results: Russell fastest from TsunodaWhat happened in Mexican GP Free Practice 2? Hamilton was fastest on the test tyres, over 1.5s off Russell’s pace, and less than a tenth clear of Perez and Verstappen., Listen to this article Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz was fastest in FP1 before Russell topped FP2, which doubled as a 2023 Pirelli prototype tyre test and so was unrepresentative in the main. But Russell set the time on 2022-spec soft tyres, as he didn’t run in FP1, so it was a competitively legitimate lap. Mexican Grand Prix FP1 results: Sainz fastest from Leclerc What happened in Mexican GP Free Practice 1? Two-time champion Max Verstappen set the early pace at 1m23.292s on hard tyres, six tenths clear of Red Bull stablemate, and local hero, Sergio Perez. Verstappen lowered that to 1m22.779s before Perez briefly nicked P1 off him with 1m22.702s to the home crowd’s delight. Verstappen then worked down to 1m22.291s, 0.382s ahead of Perez. Sainz was best of the rest for Ferrari on the hards, half a second off, while teammate Charles Leclerc was first to run on softs. Leclerc duly leapt to the top with 1m21.546s, and then improved to 1m20.753s on his second push lap. Verstappen was on course to beat Leclerc when he spun at the Esses, while Sainz did manage to pip his teammate with 1m20.707s, the fastest time of the session. Perez and Verstappen set exactly the same laptime on softs, 0.12s off the pace, with the Mercedes of Lewis Hamilton in fifth, a further 0.02s in arrears, with another 0.05s back to Fernando Alonso’s Alpine. There were plenty of incidents: On a dusty track early on, Williams’ FP1 rookie Logan Sargeant ran wide on the entry to the Foro Sol stadium section, while Alonso also briefly went off track in the Esses. The session was red flagged with 22 minutes remaining when Pietro Fittipaldi’s Haas ground to a smoky halt at Turn 2 on an out lap. Meantime, Zhou Guanyu’s Alfa Romeo needed retrieving from the end of the pit lane when his gearbox failed to upshift. Of the FP1 rookies, AlphaTauri’s Liam Lawson was fastest in 16th but had a moment and visited the escape road at Ese del Lago. In the closing minutes of the session he caused a red flag when his car suffered a technical failure and, as he didn’t have time to cool the brakes, the front-left corner caught fire. Sargeant was 17th, ahead of Nyck de Vries in his final outing for Mercedes. Jack Doohan (Alpine) hit engine trouble on his way to 19th, with Fittipaldi only managing nine laps before his day also ended early. Mexican Grand Prix FP2 results: Russell fastest from Tsunoda What happened in Mexican GP Free Practice 2? As in Austin last weekend, FP2 was a lengthened 90-minute 2023 Pirelli prototype tyre test for the majority of runners. Only those who skipped FP1, due to rookie drivers taking their place, got to run as normal. AlphaTauri’s Pierre Gasly set the early bar at 1m22.186s before Sainz lapped in 1m21.943s. Mercedes’ George Russell was back in for this session, taking over from de Vries, and leapt to the top of the times on 1m21.742s on mediums. After a Red Bull interlude – Verstappen took P1 with 1m21.588s, before Perez pipped him by 0.009s on 1m21.579s – Russell switched to softs and unleashed 1m19.970s. Yuki Tsunoda was second quickest for AlphaTauri, ahead of Alpine’s Esteban Ocon – both also on the 2022 softs. Just after the 30-minute mark Leclerc crashed heavily on the exit of Turn 8, backing his Ferrari backwards into the barriers. Hamilton was fastest on the test tyres, over 1.5s off Russell’s pace, and less than a tenth clear of Perez and Verstappen. The session ended two minutes early when Zhou pulled off with a hydraulic failure in the Foro Sol.
Mexico City Grand Prix: Ferrari 'not happy' with size of Red Bull budget cap penalty, https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/63438890, The Mexico City Grand Prix is live on 5 Live and the BBC Sport websiteFerrari say they are "not happy" with the penalty imposed on rivals Red Bull for breaking Formula 1's budget cap. F1's governing body the FIA said on Friday Red Bull had breached the cap in 2021 by £1.86m and imposed a $7m fine and 10% cut in aerodynamic research. Ferrari racing director Laurent Mekies said Red Bull's breach was "a significant amount" and that "the real effect of the penalty is very limited". Red Bull team boss Christian Horner described the penalty as "draconian". "Furthermore, there is another problem in that, since there is no budget cap reduction in the penalty, the basic effect is to push the competitor to spend the money elsewhere., The Mexico City Grand Prix is live on 5 Live and the BBC Sport website Ferrari say they are "not happy" with the penalty imposed on rivals Red Bull for breaking Formula 1's budget cap. F1's governing body the FIA said on Friday Red Bull had breached the cap in 2021 by £1.86m and imposed a $7m fine and 10% cut in aerodynamic research. Ferrari racing director Laurent Mekies said Red Bull's breach was "a significant amount" and that "the real effect of the penalty is very limited". Red Bull team boss Christian Horner described the penalty as "draconian". Horner claimed that the effect of the aerodynamic reduction on Red Bull's car "represents between 0.25secs and 0.5secs of lap time - it comes in from now and will be in place for a 12-month period". Horner also pointed to a line in the FIA judgement that said had Red Bull applied the correct treatment to a notional tax credit, the team would have exceeded the cap by only £432,652. This, he said, reduced the overspend from 1.6% to 0.37%. But Mekies questioned Horner's assessment of the net impact of the penalty. In an interview with Sky Sports Italia, he said: "We at Ferrari think that this amount (of overspend) is worth around a couple of tenths (per lap), and so it's easy to understand that these figures can have a real impact on the outcome of the races and maybe even a championship. "As for the penalty, we are not happy with it, for two important reasons. The first is that we at Ferrari do not understand how the 10% reduction of the ATA (aerodynamic research allowance) can correspond to the same amount of lap time that we mentioned earlier. "Furthermore, there is another problem in that, since there is no budget cap reduction in the penalty, the basic effect is to push the competitor to spend the money elsewhere. 'People choose narrative that suits' - Horner on budget cap fine "It has total freedom to use the money it can no longer spend on use of the wind tunnel and CFD due to the 10% reduction, on reducing the weight of the car or who knows what else. "Our concern is that the combination of these two factors means the real effect of the penalty is very limited." Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff told Sky Sports: "Overall, it's good to see that there is a penalty, whether we deem it too low or too high. "I think what you see is that beyond a sporting penalty and financial fine, it's also reputational damage," Wolff said. "In a world of transparency and good governance, that's just not on anymore." Mekies' comments follow those from McLaren Racing chief executive officer Zak Brown, who told BBC Sport on Friday: "If the FIA is to be most effective and its punishments serve as a lesson to others when rules are broken in this way, the sanctions have to be much stronger in the future." Horner said in an interview with BBC Sport: "For a 0.37% overspend, I think a 10% reduction is pretty draconian, that's worth potentially quarter to half a second of a season's development, has an impact on our performance next year and makes our challenge even greater as we head into 2023. It's applicable from now so it affects next year's car. "Anyone who diminished that penalty is uneducated in terms of what the actual value of it in terms of performance." He added that the lost time was "an enormous handicap". Horner said: "We didn't spend one penny of this money on making the car go faster." He added: "The FIA have been harsh, they stand by their budget cap, it was important for them. "I believe in now drawing a line under it, take the hit, performance hit. We're going to have to work harder and smart within the time we have in the winter, which is our primary development time." He rejected suggestions that Red Bull driver Max Verstappen should be stripped of last year's title, won in controversial circumstances at the final race of the season after a tight battle with Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton. "We feel we've been chastised enough," he said. "We feel the public slating we had through mud being slung by some of our competitors is penalty enough. "Time to move on - Verstappen is 2021 World Champion, our focus is very much now on (this weekend's) Mexican Grand Prix and trying to finish the season off in a high." And he denied that there was now an asterisk against Verstappen's first title, won after the race director applied the rules incorrectly during a late safety-car period in the final race of the season and in a year in which his team had broken the rules on spending. "Absolutely not," Horner said. "Last year went down in history as one of the most titanic battles in F1 history. Verstappen was a hugely deserving champion. Inevitably there will be partisan support on either side but the reality is he did the job, he won the race at the final Grand Prix of the year and 2021 is now confined to the history books. "People will choose a narrative at the end of the day. I think Max did absolutely nothing wrong last year. He won the race fair and square, as a team we performed out of our skin to break the domination of one team that has dominated in the last seven years, nothing can diminish from what he did last year and that's obviously backed up again in 2022."
Verstappen expects “a lot of crashes” when F1 ditches tyre blankets, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/verstappen-expects-a-lot-of-crashes-when-f1-ditches-tyre-blankets/10391253/, “Of course, I also had the hardest compound, but I think there's a lot more to it. If we have the tyre blankets anyway, why don't we just use them to the fullest because they're there? Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing, talks to the press Photo by: Mark Sutton / Motorsport Images“You either go just full blankets or zero, not middle way because we have them already. “I think we're going to have a lot of crashes. “Your tyre pressures are going to go through the roof, so your tyres are going to degrade a lot more., F1 has been toying with the idea of outlawing tyre blankets since the switch to 18 inch wheels was finalised, with that originally set to go ahead in 2021 before the COVID-19 pandemic forced the new car regulations to be delayed until 2022. The series had already elected against a complete tyre blanket ban for 2021 back in 2019, with the phasing out of the warmers taking place gradually. Teams are currently permitted to a maximum tyre warmer temperature of 70 degrees Celsius this year, down from 100 last year, with that maximum level dropping to 50 in 2023 before a full ban in 2024. Two 2023 Pirelli tyre tests have taken place in the FP2 sessions at the United States and Mexican GPs, when teams ran to the 50-degree setting, which Verstappen said “was not enjoyable”. Asked ahead of this weekend’s Mexican Grand Prix what his thoughts are on the incoming tyre blanket ban in 2024, the Red Bull driver expects the rule change to cause chaos on track. “Yes, it was not enjoyable,” Verstappen said of the Austin tyre test. “I drove on [tyres that were warmed to] 50 degrees, I think it was, and I almost spun in the pitlane already. “Of course, I also had the hardest compound, but I think there's a lot more to it. If we have the tyre blankets anyway, why don't we just use them to the fullest because they're there? Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing, talks to the press Photo by: Mark Sutton / Motorsport Images “You either go just full blankets or zero, not middle way because we have them already. We don't need to buy new ones. “I think we're going to have a lot of crashes. That I know already compared to what we have at the moment. But yeah, it's tough. “Also, your tyre degradation is going to be completely different because your tyres are very cold. You are sliding around a lot in the first few laps. “Your tyre pressures are going to go through the roof, so your tyres are going to degrade a lot more. At the moment I don't really enjoy it but a lot of drivers say the same and we have to find a solution to that. “Austin is still a track where you can easily switch on the tyres because of the high speed cornering. But if you go to like a track like a street circuit or Monaco, can imagine you on like half-half conditions. “I think is going to take like half of the race before you have like temperature on your tyres.” Verstappen also hit back at suggestions outlawing tyre blankets could make the overcut pitstop strategy in races more powerful, as is the case in GT racing. “You have a lot less power [in a GT car],” the Red Bull driver added. “I think with these [F1] cars they are very heavy as well. I mean, I've tried it and it's just really almost impossible to drive. “And I also drive still in my private time. I drive a GT3 car with no tyre blankets, but these cars are a lot more forgiving and it's a lot easier to manage than these kind of [F1] cars, because if you go on power a little bit too much, with the power you have from the engine, it can be a big, big crash.”

Doohan had more nerves chasing Alpine seat than FP1 debut, https://the-race.com/formula-1/doohan-had-more-nerves-chasing-alpine-seat-than-fp1-debut/, Formula 1 free practice debutant Jack Doohan was more nervous lobbying for more opportunities within Alpine than he was actually driving its car at the Mexican Grand Prix. Doohan drove in place of Esteban Ocon in FP1 at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez and will do the same in Fernando Alonso’s car in Abu Dhabi next month. Although Alpine eventually picked Pierre Gasly, it is clear Doohan has succeeded Piastri as the ‘next-in-line’ talent from the Alpine young driver programme, from the 2022 car outings to an enhanced 2021 car testing schedule. Doohan said the process of getting into the position was more daunting than driving the car itself. “I felt for the grip level it just caught me a little bit off guard, and I had that moment., Formula 1 free practice debutant Jack Doohan was more nervous lobbying for more opportunities within Alpine than he was actually driving its car at the Mexican Grand Prix. Doohan drove in place of Esteban Ocon in FP1 at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez and will do the same in Fernando Alonso’s car in Abu Dhabi next month. He is fulfilling Alpine’s ‘rookie driver’ requirement for two Friday practice sessions, an opportunity that should have gone to Oscar Piastri before his controversial exit from the team was agreed. When Piastri’s rift with the team emerged at the start of the summer break, Doohan emerged as a potential alternative for a race drive at Alpine next year to replace Aston Martin-bound Fernando Alonso and actively pitched himself to the team as well. Although Alpine eventually picked Pierre Gasly, it is clear Doohan has succeeded Piastri as the ‘next-in-line’ talent from the Alpine young driver programme, from the 2022 car outings to an enhanced 2021 car testing schedule. Doohan said the process of getting into the position was more daunting than driving the car itself. “There’s been quite a bit of prep leading up to this, and I’ve been preparing myself trying to make my way into this paddock since the news broke at the start of August, and I’ve been aiming towards this,” said Doohan on Friday in Mexico. “So, the nerves that I’d say usually would be from jumping from Formula 2 to Formula 1 and it being such a big thing were a little bit less, just because I was trying to put myself in a position where this is where I want to be. “I want to be driving in Formula 1. I’d say there were more nerves four weeks ago than there were today. “Obviously, when I hopped in the car, and I was pulling out of the garage, there was a lot of excitement, a lot of joy, heaps of emotions going on. “Once I was out on track, that all really kind of flushed away. “It was hard to describe really what I was feeling, but it was a really cool sensation.” Doohan had driven the 2022 car prior to this outing as he completed a filming day at Monza. He said that gave him an idea of how it was heavier and lazier than the 2021 car he has driven in various private tests but the unique conditions in Mexico meant his FP1 outing was tricky. Why Alpine thinks Gasly’s a better fit than Alonso or Piastri Read more Doohan was on a hiding to nothing in terms of headline laptimes as his programme was purely to stay on one set of hard tyres for the entire session and complete a valuable run plan for the team. Unfortunately for him, this was derailed by an engine issue that set in towards the end of his first run and returned when his second run was starting. He did not return to the track after a late red flag, which meant he only completed 13 laps. “I’m happy in a way, not for my running, but that we found this issue now, instead of happening later in the weekend that potentially could have affected us to score points,” said Doohan. He had equipped himself well in the circumstances, though. The first run was about building up tyre temperature and confidence in the car with some flexibility in his run plan to react to how he felt. There was little in the way of feedback beyond pushing the braking zone harder in Turn 4 and tidying up his at-times wayward runs through the Esses, although he complained about the car’s ride quality over some of the kerbs. Ultimately, there is nothing significant to judge Doohan on, beyond the fact he was performing professionally and competently – and adhering to a joking warning from Ocon not to crash his car. “When he last left his car for an FP1 I think it was here in Mexico, in 2017, and the driver [Alfonso Celis Jr] that he let drive his car, put it in the wall in Turn 13,” said Doohan. “And so from last weekend, he was like, ‘Do not crash my car’. “Honestly, every time I came out, exit of Turn 13, and through 14, I had Esteban in my head going, ‘Do not crash this car’. “So, I’d just roll it in, not braking, super easy, keep it like five meters from the exit kerb – just very easy! “So, hopefully, he can take that into consideration that I kept his car clean.” There were moments of mild excitement for Doohan, in particular on his second lap when he had quite a wild kick heading into the sweeps in the middle sector. His sheepish grin when The Race put this to him suggests not many people had noticed this. “That was a little much for what I was liking at that point in time!” he said. Mark Hughes: Ferrari’s Mexico Friday pace edge is deceptive Read more “And it was an area that I was driving super under the limit. If I was wanting to extract laptime, which I wasn’t, as I was doing the whole session on the hard and we were doing sustainable running, I was supposed to be taking it very easy. “I felt for the grip level it just caught me a little bit off guard, and I had that moment. “I thought I’d take it a little bit easier through there next lap.” Given the likes of Alonso, Max Verstappen and Charles Leclerc had their own moments to varying degrees of severity, Doohan can be afforded such minor slips.
The knock-on impact of Red Bull penalty that's upset Ferrari, https://the-race.com/formula-1/the-knock-on-impact-of-red-bull-penalty-thats-upset-ferrari/, Red Bull was fined $7million and had 10% of its aerodynamic testing allowance for the next 12 months removed after it agreed an Accepted Breach Agreement with the FIA for overspending. But Red Bull was the only one of the 10 teams found to have overspent. Is Red Bull’s F1 cost cap penalty adequate? But according to the FIA Cost Cap Administration analysis, its final overspend figure was £432,652 once its ‘Relevant Costs’ (those covered by the cost cap) were recalculated. So while Horner did concede that Red Bull was “aggressive” with its attempt to exclude all catering costs, he indicated it did believe it had some leeway., Sporting director Laurent Mekies says Ferrari believes the “basic effect” of the Accepted Breach Agreement Red Bull reached with the FIA over its 2021 Formula 1 cost cap overspend encourages money that could otherwise have been taken from the team’s budget to be spent elsewhere. Red Bull was fined $7million and had 10% of its aerodynamic testing allowance for the next 12 months removed after it agreed an Accepted Breach Agreement with the FIA for overspending. The cost cap was introduced in 2021 at a baseline figure of $145m, dropping to $140m this year and $135m next year – although the real figures are higher thanks to various extra allowances and inflation adjustments. But Red Bull was the only one of the 10 teams found to have overspent. Mekies said Ferrari believes the overspend equates to a performance gain of two tenths and reiterated the team’s discontent at the “very limited’ penalty its rival had been given. “We at Ferrari do not understand how the 10% reduction of the ATA can correspond to the same amount of lap time,” said Mekies. “Furthermore, there is another problem in that since there is no budget cap reduction in the penalty, the basic effect is to push the competitor to spend the money elsewhere. Is Red Bull’s F1 cost cap penalty adequate? Our verdict Read more “It has total freedom to use the money it can no longer spend on use of the windtunnel and CFD due to the 10% reduction, on reducing the weight of the car or who knows what else. “Our concern is that the combination of these two factors means the real effect of the penalty is very limited.” Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff suggested it was sensible for teams to leave some headroom in spending for 2021 to allow for any variation in interpretation of the regulations. “Yes, absolutely, you need to build a little bit of leeway,” said Wolff, when asked by Sky Sports F1 if Mercedes played it safe because the regulations were new. “You can’t take an aggressive approach in the beginning. It’s a process, it’s learning on the job.” ﻿ Red Bull’s original submission placed it £3.7m under the cost cap, according to team principal Christian Horner. But according to the FIA Cost Cap Administration analysis, its final overspend figure was £432,652 once its ‘Relevant Costs’ (those covered by the cost cap) were recalculated. So while Horner did concede that Red Bull was “aggressive” with its attempt to exclude all catering costs, he indicated it did believe it had some leeway. Alpine team principal Otmar Szafnauer echoed Wolff’s position, indicating that the team had a “buffer” in the early days of the cost cap as it works to maximising the permitted spending once fully comfortable with the regulations. Why unapologetic Red Bull went for cost cap ‘plea bargain’ Read more “The more refined that your processes are, your accounting processes, the closer you can get to the cap and feel comfortable you haven’t missed anything that will put you over,” said Szafnauer. “However, if your processes aren’t very refined, if you don’t have that fidelity, then what you have to do is give yourself a big enough margin that if you did make a mistake you don’t go over. “That’s exactly what we do. As we go on in time, and we get more comfortable, we’ll aim to be right on the cap. But today, we’re millions under just to have that buffer so we don’t go over.” Szafnauer suggested this is an approach shared by several teams, which he hoped will ensure that there isn’t a repeat of the cost cap controversy next year with a team or teams spending too much thanks to the scale of the challenge of the 2022 cars. “Well, I hope not,” he said when asked if he expected to hear more about this at the same time next year. “We put in a buffer so that we assure ourselves that we’re under. People make mistakes and you can make mistakes, that it’s not malicious or it’s not intentional, but then to be able to sleep well at night to say, ‘You know what, we’re going to be under’, we give ourselves that buffer. “And I think maybe some of the other teams do the same.” The 13 ways Red Bull got its cost cap calculation wrong Read more Szafnauer backed the punishment given to Red Bull on the basis that “the punishment is a good one”, while Wolff was non-committal, saying “it’s just good to see that there is a penalty, whether we deem it too low or too high”. But Andreas Seidl, team principal of McLaren, felt that the penalty did not fit the crime. Zak Brown, McLaren CEO, sent a letter to the FIA calling for any cost cap “cheating” to be heavily penalised with the team taking a strong line on the need for significant punishment. “In the end, on the positive side it’s good to see that they did a good job in terms of doing the audit,” said Seidl. M c Laren: Future penalties must be ‘much stronger’ than Red Bull’s Read more “Nine teams got it right, and it was confirmed that one team was clearly in breach, so that’s a positive outcome. But on the negative side, it’s also clear that from my point of view that the penalty clearly doesn’t fit the breach. I just hope that moving forward we have stricter penalties in place.” Wolff said he hoped the penalty will act as “a deterrent”, but in response to suggestions teams could be tempted to overspend deliberately given the size of the Red Bull penalty he said that the negative impact on a team’s reputation plays a part in the desire to avoid an overspend. “What you see beyond the sporting penalty and the financial fine is also reputational damage,” said Wolff. “In a world of transparency and good governance, that’s just not on anymore. “Compliance-wise, whatever team you are, you’re responsible for representing your brand, your employees, your partners. And that’s why for us it wouldn’t be a business case.”
Red Bull principal Christian Horner 'begrudgingly' accepts 'draconian' penalties for exceeding F1 spending cap, https://www.eurosport.co.uk/formula-1/red-bull-principal-christian-horner-begrudgingly-accepts-draconian-penalties-for-exceeding-f1spendin_sto9205372/story.shtml, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has accepted his team’s punishments for going over their spending cap while describing their penalty as ‘draconian’. Speaking ahead of the season’s third-last Grand Prix, in Mexico this weekend, Horner explained why he had decided to accept the penalties rather than appeal them. “We accept the penalties - begrudgingly, but we accept them.”He continued, complaining about the size of the scale of the punishments. Red Bull have enjoyed back-to-back success, with the 2022 campaign already seeing them win the drivers’ and constructors’ championships. Mexican Grand Prix Leclerc unhurt after a severe crash during practice for the Mexican Grand Prix YESTERDAY AT 07:59, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has accepted his team’s punishments for going over their spending cap while describing their penalty as ‘draconian’. With the end of the season closing in, F1’s regulatory body declared that two teams had gone over the limits for the previous campaign. Ad Rival team Mercedes and others in the sport had complained that they had exceeded their allowance, which led to a war of words between Horner and other figures in the sport, claiming that family members of Red Bull's staff had been bullied because of the accusations. Formula 1 'Draconian is an exaggeration' - Mercedes on Red Bull’s budget cap penalty 12 HOURS AGO On Friday the punishment for the Austrian team was revealed, with a $7 million fine as well as a 10% reduction on what the team can spend on aerodynamics. Speaking ahead of the season’s third-last Grand Prix, in Mexico this weekend, Horner explained why he had decided to accept the penalties rather than appeal them. He said: “Why have we accepted it? Had we dragged it out through the administration process, that could have taken months and beyond that the ICA could have taken further months. We could have been looking at a 12-month period to have this closed. "And the amount of speculation and sniping that has been going on, we felt it was in everyone’s interests to close the book. “We accept the penalties - begrudgingly, but we accept them.” He continued, complaining about the size of the scale of the punishments. "$7m is an enormous amount of money and the more draconian part is the sporting penalty which is a 10% reduction in our ability to use our wind tunnel and aerodynamic tools. That represents between 0.25secs and 0.5secs of lap time. “By winning the constructors' championship, we become victims of our own success by having a 5% incremental handicap compared to second and third places, so we will have 15% less than second, and 20% less than third. “That will have an impact on our ability to perform on track." Red Bull have enjoyed back-to-back success, with the 2022 campaign already seeing them win the drivers’ and constructors’ championships.

The advantage handed to Mercedes over Red Bull and Ferrari in Mexican GP practice, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/what-we-learned-in-opening-practice-for-f1s-2022-mexican-gp/10392077/, So too was the additional FP2 running on the 2022 tyres afforded to drivers that sat out FP1 in place of rookie drivers. Nevertheless, this added time that Russell enjoyed will still provide Mercedes with a key advantage against Red Bull and Ferrari. Leclerc’s FP1 best came on a second flier in a three-lap stint, while Sainz’s only qualifying simulation was his first and only flying effort on the softs. At Red Bull, which had topped the early slower running on the hards, Perez ended up third – but also set his best time after the peak condition of his soft rubber had passed. Red Bull has been the dominant package in 2022, but can it keep that status in Mexico?, George Russell topped the times at the end of the opening day of practice for Formula 1’s 2022 Mexican Grand Prix, where Ferrari’s strong start was undone by Charles Leclerc’s FP2 crash during the second in-season Pirelli tyre test in a week. Ferrari led the way in a 1-2 in opening practice on Friday afternoon, but Leclerc’s off mid-way through the second session – elongated to 90-minutes to allow for the extra running on Pirelli’s 2023 compounds – means Ferrari was left with a long repair job after he badly damaged the rear of his F1-75. As it took nearly 20 minutes for the barriers to be repaired after his shunt in FP2, the data Pirelli required for its test was reduced. So too was the additional FP2 running on the 2022 tyres afforded to drivers that sat out FP1 in place of rookie drivers. Nevertheless, this added time that Russell enjoyed will still provide Mercedes with a key advantage against Red Bull and Ferrari. This comes on a weekend where the Silver Arrows squad is hoping the unique high-altitude demands of the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez track will mean it can get among F1 2022’s frontrunners for the win. This, and more, is what we learned at the Mexico City track on Friday. The story of the day: In FP1, Sainz and Leclerc led the way – the former topping the times with a 1m20.707s. Sainz had the easier start to the session of the pair as Leclerc missed the early laps getting up to speed on the hard tyres – used by all the rest of the field on the initially very dirty track surface – due to an early puncture. But Leclerc came back out after 22 minutes of the one-hour practice session immediately using the softs, which he took to the head of the times before Sainz pipped him later on. Leclerc’s FP1 best came on a second flier in a three-lap stint, while Sainz’s only qualifying simulation was his first and only flying effort on the softs. At Red Bull, which had topped the early slower running on the hards, Perez ended up third – but also set his best time after the peak condition of his soft rubber had passed. After missing the Turn 1 apex, the home hero swiftly abandoned his initial effort on that compound, then produced two fliers on laps two and five of a six-lap stint – the latter resulting in his 0.120s gap to Sainz. Red Bull has been the dominant package in 2022, but can it keep that status in Mexico? Photo by: Mark Sutton / Motorsport Images Verstappen finished fourth in FP1 – also 0.120s adrift with an identical best time with his team-mate – after he spun off on his first softs flier, unable to catch a rear wheel slide after hitting the inside Turn 10 kerbs. Despite stamping on the brakes to avoid hitting the wall as he spun off into the runoff, he didn’t pit to change those tyres and then used them to set a personal best two laps later. Hamilton trailed in fifth for Mercedes – 0.142s slower than Sainz with his best effort on the softs, but with a bizarre moment late-on. The Briton, seemingly at the start of a long run he then abandoned, had just entered the track’s sector three stadium section running the softs when he slowed and toured slowly ahead of Pierre Gasly and Daniel Ricciardo, before jinking left out of the McLaren’s way and then pitting. In FP2, Russell initially headed out to complete a long run on the 2022 mediums – reflecting typical work in this session on a ‘normal’ weekend, albeit inverted as his race-data-gathering exercise was followed by his fliers on the softs. After Russell led the way on ultimate pace on Friday, Ferrari should be encouraged by the outcomes of the long-run averages from FP1 – where it and Red Bull completed identical programmes after the qualifying simulations – even if Leclerc’s crash was unfortunate in FP2 That work on the red-walled rubber put Russell top with a 1m19.970s and he was followed by fellow FP1 absentees Yuki Tsunoda and Esteban Ocon, 0.828s and 1.207s back respectively, for AlphaTauri and Alpine. Both of their cars had had to be repaired after a pressure loss and engine issue occurred aboard them when Liam Lawson and Jack Doohan were at the respective wheels in FP1. The FP2 tyre test run plan went along the same lines as it had a week ago at Austin – two stints of five laps with the cars running 20kg of fuel and then longer stints running 100kg fuel. Unlike in America, the longer stints were extended, although confusingly by different lengths across the field as they pitted and then headed back out in the aftermath of Leclerc’s crash. Again, no set-up changes were permitted and DRS could not be used – after some confusion in the Austin test that led to the device’s usage initially being allowed and then stopped by the FIA. The delay for Leclerc’s stoppage at least meant there were plenty of cars running on track to the end, as they had not been at Austin once the test programme there was completed, to ensure they maximised Pirelli’s programme. Having sat out FP1, Russell was one of only a few drivers permitted to run 2022 tyres during FP2 Photo by: Zak Mauger / Motorsport Images Hamilton topped the times for those running the prototypes, which are at the softer end of Pirelli’s planned 2023 range after the harder examples were tested in the USA. This test replaced the missed running in Japan due to the wet weather at Suzuka earlier this month. Why Mercedes’ extra FP2 2022 tyre running will be valuable Although the tyre test dominated FP2, while five squads got extra time to run the 2022 compounds, all making interpreting the times even more fraught than usual – and with all the usual fuel load and engine mode caveats applying – we can assess how things stack up so far for the frontrunners looking towards Sunday’s race. After Russell led the way on ultimate pace on Friday, Ferrari should be encouraged by the outcomes of the long-run averages from FP1 – where it and Red Bull completed identical programmes after the qualifying simulations – even if Leclerc’s crash was unfortunate in FP2. Ferrari led the way by 0.213s on the softs (from a longer stint length of seven laps for Leclerc against five for Perez) in the late-FP1 long-running. And it was just 0.081s slower in comparison over the twin six-lap stints Sainz and Verstappen completed in that session. Russell’s average for his early FP2 long-run on the mediums comes in at 1m22.826s over a seven-lap stint, which compares to Ferrari’s FP1 best on the softs of 1m24.151s and Red Bull edging the hards average at 1m24.698s. Here, Mercedes has a key advantage over Red Bull and Ferrari for the rest of the Mexico this weekend – because it was able to run closer to the conditions likely to occur on Sunday, where temperatures are forecast to be down by 2°C compared to the 26°C peak reached on Friday. The data Russell logged with his medium tyre run early in FP2 came in two hours past the race’s 2pm start time, getting closer to those temperatures on what is set to be a key race tyre on a track where traction and braking demands are high on the low-grip surface. Leclerc's crash in second practice may have put Ferrari on the backfoot Photo by: Andy Hone / Motorsport Images Although Red Bull and Ferrari were able to get long runs in late in FP1, so was Mercedes using Nyck de Vries – although his average on the hards came in 0.794s slower than Verstappen’s best, reflecting his unfamiliarity with the W13 compared to Hamilton and Russell. Red Bull and Ferrari will have to be busy in FP3 gathering additional race-run data, but this extra running for Mercedes in particular will be useful at a track where it has a good chance of getting amongst Red Bull and Ferrari in the victory hunt due to the thin, high-altitude Mexico City air negating the extra drag penalty the W13 usually carries. Ferrari started things strongly here in Mexico City and Red Bull remains the hot favourite given the RB18 has ended the season as the class package It’s also worth remembering here that having the extra time on the 2022 tyres helped Ferrari in an unexpected way at Austin as it was able to fall back on Leclerc’s medium tyre long run after he missed a planned equivalent in FP3 due to the team discovering a small tyre cut just as he was about to head out. That said, Ferrari started things strongly here in Mexico City and Red Bull remains the hot favourite given the RB18 has ended the season as the class package, with a dominant world champion in one car and a home driver keen to please his fans packing the grandstands in the other.

How catering costs contributed to Red Bull’s F1 budget cap overspend, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/how-catering-costs-contributed-to-red-bulls-f1-budget-cap-overspend/10392037/, Red Bull was fined $7m and docked 10% of its aerodynamic testing time in the next 12 months. The FIA’s ruling detailed a number of areas where Red Bull had wrongly excluded costs, which led to an overspend of £1.8m. One of these was catering, which emerged as one of the areas that had been interpreted differently when news first broke out that Red Bull may have breached the budget cap. “Red Bull Powertrains had nothing to do with Red Bull Racing until this year, and their costs are included. So a difference of opinion on how that was applied.”Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB18, Sergio Perez, Red Bull Racing RB18 Photo by: Glenn Dunbar / Motorsport ImagesHorner explained a number of other areas that Red Bull believed could be excluded from the budget cap spend, causing its submission that was over £3m below the budget cap to be deemed as going £1.8m over., Listen to this article The FIA announced on Friday in Mexico that it had struck an Accepted Breach Agreement with Red Bull after finding the team had exceeded the $145 million budget cap last year. Red Bull was fined $7m and docked 10% of its aerodynamic testing time in the next 12 months. Red Bull fiercely denied throughout the saga that it had spent beyond the budget cap, but said on Friday that it accepted the FIA’s proposal in the best interests of F1, ensuring the case did not drag on. The FIA’s ruling detailed a number of areas where Red Bull had wrongly excluded costs, which led to an overspend of £1.8m. One of these was catering, which emerged as one of the areas that had been interpreted differently when news first broke out that Red Bull may have breached the budget cap. Speaking on Friday in Mexico, Red Bull team boss Horner acknowledged that “a lot has been made” about the catering allowance, joking that it had been suggested “we gave our staff too much food this year.” He went on to explain that Red Bull thought catering costs were excluded from the budget cap as it is a company-wide benefit and not something solely related to the F1 team. “Catering within Red Bull has always been a benefit that’s been provided by the group, a benefit of working within the Red Bull group that free food and beverage has always been provided,” said Horner. ‘Therefore, as something as a Red Bull policy, we viewed it as something of an excluded cost. Aggressive, but we felt acceptable. “The FIA took a different viewpoint on that, and said that food was not excludable. Fair enough. But what was included was the entire catering bill of our entire company, so £1.4m worth of food, drink, coffees. “Red Bull Powertrains had nothing to do with Red Bull Racing until this year, and their costs are included. So a difference of opinion on how that was applied.” Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB18, Sergio Perez, Red Bull Racing RB18 Photo by: Glenn Dunbar / Motorsport Images Horner explained a number of other areas that Red Bull believed could be excluded from the budget cap spend, causing its submission that was over £3m below the budget cap to be deemed as going £1.8m over. One was a tax inclusion that Red Bull did not put as part of its submission which would have covered £1.4m of the breach, reducing it to just over £400k, while a change in the status back in June would also have been worth a further £1.2 had Red Bull been able to resubmit, according to Horner. Sick pay was another area that Horner said the team had disagreed with the FIA’s interpretation, with Red Bull excluding payments made to staff whose illness meant they did not work with the race team. “We always took a view that we wanted to support our members of staff in sickness and in health,” he said. “Members of staff who have been on long-term sick, we have supported them, as we will continue to do in the future. “We felt sick pay, because the role played no function in the grand prix team for a period of eight months was an excludable cost. Unfortunately, the regulations can be interpreted in two ways. “Had the person died, which thankfully they didn’t, the cost would have been excludable. Thankfully they didn’t die, but therefore the cost was included for that person.” The final big area that Horner claimed Red Bull and the FIA had disagreed on the interpretation related to outgoing staff, who were placed on projects outside of the F1 team but still had their wages included in the cost cap calculations. “We had a senior member of staff on a lock-in contract, a fixed term contract, that was offered a Hollywood-style offer from another team,” Horner explained. “At that point, you can see that their heart and mind is not within your company, and so they were transferred from the Formula 1 activity into our advanced technology activity. “The individual then left the company from there, but the time that was not spent in Formula 1 activity was included in the cap. So again, something that we vehemently felt was an excludable cost.”
Food parts and sick pay - key areas of FIA/Red Bull dispute, https://the-race.com/formula-1/food-parts-and-sick-pay-key-areas-of-fia-red-bull-dispute/, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has laid out the key areas where the team’s accounting differed from the FIA Formula 1 cost cap administration’s and contributed to Red Bull’s overspend. The first of these areas was how the team’s parts inventory could be accounted for under the cost cap. Red Bull excluded staff catering costs in its submission, which was not accepted by the FIA. Horner admitted Red Bull took an “aggressive” approach in its attempt to discount all catering costs. “Red Bull Powertrains have nothing to do with Red Bull Racing and its activity this year, their costs are included., Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has laid out the key areas where the team’s accounting differed from the FIA Formula 1 cost cap administration’s and contributed to Red Bull’s overspend. The FIA found Red Bull guilty of both a ‘minor overspend breach’ and a ‘procedural breach’’, with the ‘relevant costs’ (ie those limited by the cost cap) exceeding what was permitted by £432,652 once various factors had been taken into account. The first of these areas was how the team’s parts inventory could be accounted for under the cost cap. The 13 ways Red Bull got its cost cap calculation wrong Read more The regulations were clarified in June 2021 to allow the value of “redundant” parts reallocated to heritage divisions not to be counted. Horner suggests this accounted for an over-declaration of more than £1million of relevant costs given the clarification was received after it had made its submission, which could not subsequently be changed. “[Area] two was a change to the regulations in June, after the submission,” said Horner. “Had we been allowed to resubmit, it would have had a benefit to us in the region of £1.2m of unused parts and the way that those unused parts are accounted and treated, and that we believe have been adopted by other teams within their submissions.” The next area was catering costs. Horner said that the Cost Cap Administration considered all catering costs for the year as counting towards its calculation. Red Bull excluded staff catering costs in its submission, which was not accepted by the FIA. As there was no detailed accounting of what catering costs applied to F1 and non-F1 staff, the cost cap administration therefore counted all such costs. Horner admitted Red Bull took an “aggressive” approach in its attempt to discount all catering costs. “Catering costs – a lot has been made about [how] we’ve given our staff too much food this year,” said Horner. “Catering costs, we believed, were excluded. Why unapologetic Red Bull went for cost cap ‘plea bargain’ Read more “To go into context, when we submitted our submission we were £3.7m under the threshold. Catering within Red Bull has always been a benefit that’s been provided by the group. “Therefore, as something of a Red Bull policy, we viewed it as an excludable cost. Aggressive, but we felt acceptable. “The FIA took a different viewpoint on that and said that food was not excludable. Fair enough. But what was included was the entire catering bill of the entire company. So £1.4m pounds worth of food, drink, coffees – any of you [the media] that attended Milton Keynes during the last 12 months have contributed to our overspend. “Red Bull Powertrains have nothing to do with Red Bull Racing and its activity this year, their costs are included. So a difference of opinion on how that was applied.” The next area was related to sick pay. Red Bull attempted to exclude the costs of a member of staff who was unable to work for eight months, but was not permitted to. It should be noted that the financial regulations allow costs for any staff fulfilling the role of a colleague who is off sick to be excluded. They also allow for the costs of the employee to be excluded but only in the case of indefinite absence or not being able to return to work. “We had a difference of opinion on sick pay,” said Horner. “We have always taken the view that we wanted to support our staff in sickness and in health. And when members of staff have been on long-term sick leave, we’ve supported them, as we continue to do in the future. Red Bull thinks breach punishment could make it 0.5s slower Read more “We felt sick pay, because the role paid no function in the grand prix team for a period of eight months, was an excludable cost. “Unfortunately, the regulations can be interpreted in two ways. Had the person died, which thankfully they didn’t, the cost would have been excluded. Thankfully, they didn’t die, but therefore, the cost was included.” The case of Dan Fallows, now at Aston Martin as technical director, was also obliquely referenced by Horner. Although he didn’t name Fallows, he explained that Red Bull attempted to discount the cost of a staff member who was placed at Red Bull Advanced Technologies while still under contract ahead of the move, but that this was rejected. “Another point that we had a differing opinion on was leavers and redundancy and the movement of staff between companies,” said Horner. “This sometimes happens between grand prix teams that have separate entities [within a group]. “So for example, we had a senior member of staff on a lock-in contract, a fixed-term contract, that was offered a Hollywood-style offer from another team. And at that point, you can see that their heart and mind is not within your company. “So were transferred from the Formula 1 activity into our advanced technology activity, which is currently designing the RB17 and America’s Cup projects, amongst myriad other projects. Aston Martin’s ex-Red Bull tech lead highlights what it’s missing Read more “The individual then left the company from there, but the time that he spent not in Formula 1 activity was included in the cap. So again, [it was] something that we vehemently felt was an excludable cost. “So there are a few examples, which added together, probably come in in excess of three to three and a half million worth of value.” The financial regulations allow for what is called a ‘Reassigned Employee’ to have only their costs prior to being moved off F1 activities to be excluded from the cost cap. However, in the definitions section of the financial regulations, their role must be formally reassigned to non-F1 activities “on or prior to 30 June 2021”. Although Red Bull was aware Fallows was leaving before the end of June at the latest, he may not have been reassigned early enough to qualify as an exclusion. Horner also highlighted the impact of what the FIA called its failure to apply “the correct treatment” of its notional tax credit calculation. It stated that this would have eliminated £1,431,348 from its cost cap submission figure. This was an area where Horner said the FIA accepted mitigating factors and that had a significant impact on the overspend figure being reduced. “The FIA accepted that there were mitigating factors, in particular to one specific item where, essentially, we had overpaid within the cap the amount of tax,” said Horner. “We hadn’t excluded £1.4m of tax that was an excludable item. So when you take that into account, that £1.8m breach becomes, as the FIA, clearly states, down to a little over £400,000.” Is Red Bull’s F1 cost cap penalty adequate? Our verdict Read more The ABA summary released by the FIA listed a total of 13 areas where Red Bull’s cost-cap accounting was incorrect in terms of its exclusions and adjustments, many of those touching on elements Horner outlined. But it also covered areas that he did not mention, for example gains on the disposal of fixed assets, power unit costs and travel costs. If nothing else, this illustrates how complex this offence is and the scale of the task of accounting for all relevant spending under the cost cap – and that, while Red Bull only “begrudgingly” accepted its punishment, the breach of the regulations was clear.

Mercedes Mercedes brought along a slightly different floor edge as a test item for Nyck de Vries to try in FP1, evaluating a revised vortex generation.

Red Bull The engine cover spine has been widened to create more cooling space beneath for the extreme cooling demands brought by Mexico City’s high altitude. M c Laren Aside from additional winglets on the rear brake ducts for greater downforce (at a premium in his thin air) without worrying about the extra drag (the penalty for which is reduced here for the same reason), McLaren has brought an extensive cooling package. This comprises extra cooling louvres in the top bodywork and gurney flap on the edge of the coke bottle exit to increase the cooling airflow speed. AlphaTauri A big extra cooling package for AlphaTauri with increased exit area for the front brake ducts, a bigger central cooling exit at the rear of the bodywork and the option of extra louvre cooling area on the top of the sidepods. Aston Martin Just a small tweak to the profile of the rear deflector around the lower bodywork to improve airflow exiting the underfloor. Williams Williams registered an option to increase the cooling louvres atop the sidepods to be used if necessary.

Ferrari unhappy with “very limited” impact of FIA F1 penalty against Red Bull, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/ferrari-red-bull-fia-f1-penalty-unhappy/10391981/, Listen to this articleThe FIA announced on Friday it had reached an Accepted Breach Agreement with Red Bull over its alleged breach of last year’s financial regulations. The agreement saw Red Bull receive a $7 million fine and a 10% reduction in its aerodynamic testing time for the next 12 months. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner called the penalty “enormous” and “draconian”, claiming a number of mitigating factors had led to its breach. But Mekies noted the impact the extra money that Red Bull was found to have exceeded the cap by £1.8m could have on car developments. Since there is no cost cap reduction in the penalty, the basic effect is to push the competitor to spend the money elsewhere., Listen to this article The FIA announced on Friday it had reached an Accepted Breach Agreement with Red Bull over its alleged breach of last year’s financial regulations. The agreement saw Red Bull receive a $7 million fine and a 10% reduction in its aerodynamic testing time for the next 12 months. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner called the penalty “enormous” and “draconian”, claiming a number of mitigating factors had led to its breach. Ferrari has been clear in its calls for a strict sanction for any possible budget cap breach over recent months, saying it was crucial to protect the integrity of the financial regulations. Speaking on Sky Italia after second practice in Mexico, Ferrari’s sporting chief Laurent Mekies praised the FIA for its transparency in the decision, calling it a “very clear conclusion”. But Mekies noted the impact the extra money that Red Bull was found to have exceeded the cap by £1.8m could have on car developments. “We have talked a lot in recent weeks about what one can do with half a million more, or a million or two or three,” said Mekies. “Two million [euros] is a significant amount and we have given our opinion several times on this topic. “We at Ferrari think that this amount is worth around a couple of tenths [per lap] and so it’s easy to understand that these figures can have a real impact on the outcome of the races, and maybe even a championship.” Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB18, Charles Leclerc, Ferrari F1-75 Photo by: Red Bull Content Pool Mekies explained that Ferrari did not feel the aerodynamic testing reduction would make up for the possible gain of the overspend. He also noted that with the lack of impact on Red Bull’s budget cap, the need not to spend money on extra aerodynamic testing would allow for more to be spent elsewhere. “As for the penalty, we are not happy with it, for two important reasons,” said Mekies. “The first is that we at Ferrari do not understand how the 10% reduction of the ATR can correspond to the same amount of lap time that we mentioned earlier. “Furthermore, there is another problem in that. Since there is no cost cap reduction in the penalty, the basic effect is to push the competitor to spend the money elsewhere. “It has total freedom to use the money it can no longer spend on use of the wind tunnel and CFD due to the 10% reduction, on reducing the weight of the car, or who knows what else. “Our concern is that the combination of these two factors means the real effect of the penalty is very limited.” But Mekies felt it was important for F1 to accept the ruling and move on from the case without it dragging on much longer. He expressed his hope there would be no repeat of the saga dragging on next year, offering a quicker resolution. “We have no choice but to move on and I believe it is very important for us and also for the whole of F1 and the fans, that for 2022, we do not have to wait until next October to see the outcome of the accounts,” he said. “We will support the FIA to do what is needed to reach a conclusion as quickly as possible.”
Aussie Formula 1 prodigy Jack Doohan laments loss of Daniel Ricciardo for 2023 season, https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/f1/aussie-formula-1-prodigy-jack-doohan-laments-loss-of-daniel-ricciardo-for-2023-season-c-8695234, Daniel Ricciardo’s McLaren exit may have offered another young Aussie speed demon a golden Formula 1 opportunity, but another rising racing prodigy has lamented the loss of one of the sports role models. By the time Ricciardo attempts to make a return to the grid in 2024, there may well be three Aussies in the field after Jack Doohan continued his remarkable rise through the ranks. The 19-year-old made his practice debut in Mexico behind the wheel for Alpine, where he is an Academy driver, on Saturday morning. Doohan recorded the 19th fastest time and put himself in a prime position to take the reserve driver spot previously occupied by fellow countryman Oscar Piastri.

By the time Ricciardo attempts to make a return to the grid in 2024, there may well be three Aussies in the field after Jack Doohan continued his remarkable rise through the ranks. The 19-year-old made his practice debut in Mexico behind the wheel for Alpine, where he is an Academy driver, on Saturday morning. Son of five-time legendary MotoGP champion Mick, Doohan slotted into Esteban Ocon’s seat for the opening practice session of the Mexico City Grand Prix as the paddock took a gander at the rising stars of racing. Doohan recorded the 19th fastest time and put himself in a prime position to take the reserve driver spot previously occupied by fellow countryman Oscar Piastri. Doohan’s rise through the ranks has been inspired by legends such as his father and Michael Schumacher, who kickstarted his karting career, but he also told Sky Sports he was disappointed Ricciardo did not have a seat for next season. “There’s a lot of sadness for Daniel. He’s been the sole Australian on the grid for many years now since Mark left,” he said. “A lot of people are devastated. They’re really behind Daniel, his character inside and outside the car, and the enthusiasm he brings to the paddock and the fans is really good for our sport. “Hopefully (Ricciardo’s time off) is for the right reasons, and he can come back in a year or two, and it will be for the better.” Doohan revealed he attempted to follow in his father’s footsteps, but a broken leg convinced him to stick to four wheels.

I’d had a kart luckily gifted to me by Michael Schumacher because he and dad were quite close friends; they were neighbours in Monaco. “He came one time to our home in Australia, and we had a kart track there, so he gifted myself and my sister a go-kart for, I think … my third birthday; it was quite cool. “Once I was seven, I got back on the four wheels, and I’m quite thankful for it, obviously because I’m way too big and wide to be on two wheels.” Ricciardo’s practice sessions continued the disappointing trend of the season, finishing 11th fastest in FP1, fifth slowest of the regular drivers. FP2 was not much better, with both McLarens outside the top 12.

Leclerc was narrowly behind after his day got off to a less than ideal start, a slow puncture on his first set of hard compound tyres limiting his higher fuel running. But worse soon followed, the Monegasque losing the rear of his car in FP2 and slamming into the barriers, bringing out the red flags and ending his session much earlier than planned. MUST-SEE: Leclerc walks away from heavy FP2 crash in Mexico City Charles Leclerc - FP1: 1:20.753, P2; FP2: 1:21.618, P7 "Not the best of Fridays, as we didn’t complete a great number of laps. Unfortunately, we had a puncture straight out of the box in FP1, so we had to pit and did just a few laps on the Soft tyres after that. "In FP2, we completed some short runs. When we started with the long runs, I spun which ended my session. I don’t expect it to affect the rest of the weekend in any way and I am confident that we will have a good day tomorrow, as the feeling in the car is good." Carlos Sainz - FP1: 1:20.707, P1; FP2: 1:21.693, P8 "In general, it was a positive day here in Mexico. We completed the two sessions without any issues and managed to change the car quite a lot between the sessions to test different approaches. "It’s not an easy circuit, we’re naturally lacking downforce here due to the altitude but we’re having fun out there. "Thanks to all the Mexican fans for their great support! It’s always impressive to drive through the arena zone and hear them cheer! We’ll try to put on a good show for everyone this weekend."

He had a much quieter second session during the tyre test. As for Perez, he managed to lap in the exact same time as his team mate in FP1, sending the crowd wild every time he took to the track. But can the atmosphere and support lift him to greater heights across the weekend? TIMELINE: How the FIA Cost Cap story unfolded as Red Bull and Aston Martin enter Agreements over breaches Max Verstappen - FP1: 1:20.827, P4; FP2: 1:21.588, P6 "I had a little spin this morning in FP1, as soon as I came off the track it felt like ice and I was drifting left and right. On the soft tyres, everything felt okay but we only had one run on them. In FP2 we had to do the Pirelli tyre test, so it makes it a little bit more difficult as there are a lot of unknowns again, similar to last weekend. We have very little information, but from what we tried; everything was working okay. Let’s see what we can do come qualifying tomorrow." Sergio Perez - FP1: 1:20.827, P3; FP2: 1:21.579, P5 "It was a tricky day to get a read on things, as is typical in Mexico with the altitude, everything is floating around. It is very easy to make mistakes in these conditions so overall I think we had an ok day. I think we got up to speed fairly quickly and got into a rhythm so it should hopefully be quite straight forward tomorrow. The tyre test means you basically lose FP2 but that’s how it is for everyone and in FP1 we got a good pace and we seemed to be competitive. Ferrari look strong, as do Mercedes, so it is going to be a tough battle tomorrow in qualifying."

That meant that Russell was allowed to run the 2022 tyres in the second session, and used the soft rubber to put himself top of the leader board by quite some margin. Hamilton was also de facto top of the prototype-shod runners, but with those tyre compounds an unknown, it is difficult to draw too many conclusions as to where Mercedes are in the pecking order. READ MORE: Russell hails ‘one of our best Fridays’ as Mercedes push for breakthrough victory in Mexico Lewis Hamilton – FP1: 1:20.849, P5; FP2: 1:21.509, P4 "I had a good session today, so generally feel good about our performance so far. I really enjoyed driving around the track, because the car is feeling better and better as we learn to understand it in more detail. The tyre test in FP2 we used to get as much practice in as possible. I don't know yet where exactly we stand compared to other teams, because everyone was running different programmes and I try to mainly focus on my own programme. The 2023 tyres seem very similar to the current ones, maybe a little bit more consistent on the long runs and easier to manage in terms of overheating. Of course, we will do plenty of work tonight, to see if we can compete with the front, but you never know with this car how the rest of the weekend will go, but I hope we are able to continue to build on our positive conclusion from today." George Russell - FP2: 1:19.970, P1 "Today was one of our better Fridays, if not the best of the year so far - the car is working well and it felt good driving on this track. The pace was relatively strong, but we know the challenges at this circuit. For qualifying, the difficulty will be to get the tyres in the right window for the single lap run. And on Sunday, it will be difficult to manage temperatures for the engine and for the brakes. A podium finish should hopefully be possible for us this weekend, so that's what we will be aiming for. Not having the normal FP2 running, where we get to assess the long run performance of our rivals, doesn't allow us to understand where our competitors are and that can become a big challenge if we will struggle with tyre temperatures during the race. We take some very useful learnings about tyre temperature management for next year and will be working hard overnight as it's not going to be a straightforward weekend for sure, but positive learnings for us today." Nyck de Vries - FP1: 1:24.582, P18 "I enjoyed the session and driving the car, we did a good job in FP1. We ran a bit of a different programme today, focused on developments for next year and I'm happy with my performance, feeling more and more comfortable in the F1 environment. It was also a very emotional session for me, as it marks the end of my time in the car for the team. But I'm happy, as we ended it well and we had a great time working together. I'm grateful for the opportunity Mercedes has given me, allowing me to learn a lot and build relationships within the team and now I'm looking forward to the next chapter." Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director "We had a bit of a messy first session as we were bumping into a few limits on system temperatures, but we managed to get that much better under control in the second session. Nyck was driving in place of George for the first session. The programme was never going to flatter him as we were only running the hard tyre and working through a sequence of test items, but he did another very solid job. That finishes off his planned driving duties for our team and we are looking forward to seeing him race next year. The second session was focused on the 2023 tyres, although the regulations allowed George to do a few laps on medium and soft compounds. From what we can tell the car is working well on both single lap and long run. The balance isn't perfect so we've got areas to work on overnight, but a reasonable start at what is normally a very challenging circuit."

That transpired to be a PU problem, leading to a change between sessions but the team completed it swiftly enough for Ocon to be able to head straight out in FP2. Running the 2022 tyres, he put himself third on the leaderboard. As for Alonso, he looked quick all day and seemed to be enjoying himself as he power slid out of a fair few corners. READ MORE: FP1 debutant Doohan reflects on ‘emotional’ Mexico City outing as De Vries signs off with Mercedes Esteban Ocon - FP2: 1:21.177, P3 “It was good to test ourselves on this challenging track, which is quite low on grip but with long fast straights and challenging corners. I didn’t run in the first session with Jack driving my car. I’ve been in his position before, so well done to him on doing his first session. For Free Practice 2, we completed a lot of laps where we were able to learn quite a lot. It was slightly interrupted, but we have plenty of data to go through tonight and I’m looking forward to seeing what we can do across the next two days.” Jack Doohan - FP1: 1:24.615, P19 “It was a fantastic experience to drive in Free Practice 1 today, so thanks to Alpine for giving me that opportunity. I put in a lot of preparation for today including working with the engineers at Enstone and at the circuit as well as driving on the simulator. We had more running planned but, unfortunately, we had to stop early due to a small issue on the car. These things happen in motorsport, but to drive 13 laps here on a Grand Prix weekend was an incredible experience and something I’ll remember forever. I’m looking forward to furthering my learning experience with the team this weekend where hopefully both Esteban and Fernando can score some points.” Fernando Alonso - FP1: 1:20.899, P6; FP2: 1:22.337, P11 “I’d say it was a solid Practice for us today and it’s nice to be back here in Mexico. The track in Mexico City always has varying levels of grip and the unique high altitude puts pressure on both the car and driver. We need to adjust and adapt to these challenging conditions, which we will no doubt face all weekend. Overall, we completed our Friday programme, and we head into tomorrow feeling confident of a strong result.” Alan Permane, Sporting Director “Jack did a great job today in his first official Formula 1 session. The track here in Mexico City is not easy to drive, especially on debut, and he certainly gave a good account of himself. Unfortunately, his session ended slightly early with a power unit issue but, during his running, he was very sensible, built up the speed lap by lap and gave us some good feedback. Thereafter, he observed a lot by just watching. Fernando had a smooth day and the car looked reasonable across both sessions. Esteban wasn’t able to complete a full programme on race tyres due to the red flag midway through the session and Pirelli prototype tyre testing, but we have enough data to assess in preparation for the rest of the weekend where the aim, as usual, is to have both drivers inside the top ten.” Next Previous Enlarge 1 / 3 MEXICO CITY, MEXICO - OCTOBER 28: Esteban Ocon of France driving the (31) Alpine F1 A522 Renault on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Mexico at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez on October 28, 2022 in Mexico City, Mexico.

But he fared better in FP2, with 27 laps to his name. Norris had a quiet day, but will be going all out tomorrow to try and secure a good grid slot and get McLaren into a strong position from which to fight with Alpine on Sunday. Daniel Ricciardo - FP1: 1:21.762, P11; FP2: 1:22.763, P15 "It was nice to be back, so a good day. We had a couple of issues here and there but I think, nonetheless, a good day. We found a few things to work on but also, I think we made steps on some set-up stuff, so I think all we need is a smooth day tomorrow. It’s hard to know competitor-wise, where we are compared to the others, but I think for the most part I had a decent feeling, and when the car was in a good place, I had enough confidence in it. So, hopefully, as I said, a smooth day tomorrow, and we can just build and get ourselves a good qualifying." Lando Norris - FP1: 1:21.120, P8; FP2: 1:22.738, P14 "It wasn’t a bad day. We made some progress on the car but we’re still not where we need to be with the pace. The track has a very low downforce and is a slippery surface, but I'm feeling more confident with it after today’s sessions. Overall, we learnt a lot, but we’ll keep working hard overnight as a team to get ready for qualifying tomorrow." Andrea Stella, Executive Director, Racing "As usual, the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez presents some challenges to Formula 1 cars because of the low-density air at this altitude. The good thing today is that we acquired plenty of data. We know where we are and understand that we have some work to do overnight. Using FP2 for a mandatory Pirelli tyre test means the competitive situation is not as clear as usual – we expect to fight again in a close midfield battle and we’ll try to get through to Q3 tomorrow and have a good Mexico City Grand Prix on Sunday."

His brakes then caught fire, the first victims of the high altitude here that makes cooling the car so critical. The team did well to ready the car for Tsunoda in the afternoon, who only missed a few laps' worth of running. One of four drivers on the 2022 tyres, the Japanese racer grabbed second. As for Gasly, frustration at traffic in FP1 soon mellowed as he completed a decent number of laps in FP2. Pierre Gasly - FP1: 1:21.310, P9; FP2: 1:22.104, P10 “It’s been a great day. In FP1, I felt good in the car, we know it’s quite a unique track as it’s at such high altitude, but usually this works quite well for us. This morning straight away I was on the pace, we know it’s super tight in the midfield so I hope tomorrow, when we put it altogether, we can fight for the top 10. This afternoon we can’t make many conclusions, as we don’t know the compounds we’ve been running, but generally I felt quite good in the car, which is the most important thing. It feels great to be racing back in Mexico, both at the track and away from it it’s absolutely hectic, but it’s fun to be back here and feel the passion of the fans.” Yuki Tsunoda - FP2: 1:20.798, P2 “I’m quite happy after FP2, of course it’s not that representative, but straight away I felt confident in the car and was able to put in some strong laps. It was quite easy to adapt to the circuit, which I wasn’t expecting, so it’s been a positive FP2. I spent the start of the session just building up the pace and then I moved to the test tyres. As I missed FP1, I’ve got a lot of data to look through tonight and some more work to do in FP3, so that I can hopefully put it altogether for Quali tomorrow.” Liam Lawson - FP1: 1:23.861, P16 “It’s been great to be back on track with Scuderia AlphaTauri after my last shot out in Spa. This time we played a bit more with set-up changes, as the more I drive the car the more accurate feedback I can give. Due to the Pirelli test in FP2 we saved a set of tyres for that, so I only ran on one set, which I believe most the juniors did today. It’s a really interesting circuit. I’d been on the sim a lot obviously, but when I first drove it was quite eye opening, there’s very low grip and it’s extremely slippery, especially through some of the high-speed areas. Driving through the stadium though was crazy, the atmosphere is incredible, even when I had to stop the car there, they were all cheering. Sadly, we had to stop because we had a loss of pressure. However, I was able to complete most the session anyway, so it didn’t impact too much.” Jonathan Eddolls, Chief Race Engineer “It was great to have Liam back driving for us in FP1, this time taking over Yuki’s car. He did a very good job, particularly as he only ran a single hard tyre in that session. He got quickly up to speed and was setting competitive lap times even against the experienced drivers. We had several aero test items which we completed with him and captured very good data to help us with the setup direction. His running came to an end just before the end of the session, as we spotted a loss of pressure, but the mechanics did a great job to get the car repaired and ready for Yuki for FP2. Pierre was focusing on general setup work and long run tyre gathering in FP1 - it was a tight programme given the Pirelli test in FP2 - but we gathered enough data to prepare for Quali and the race on Sunday. Yuki was able to run the 2022 tyres at the start of FP2 before switching to the Pirelli test, which had to be cut short for all drivers due to the Red Flag. In general, the car balance was close even at the start of the weekend, so we will use Friday as a good foundation to make any subtle changes overnight. Our competitiveness is looking quite good, and we will do all we can to aim for a place in Q3 tomorrow.” Next Previous Enlarge 1 / 3 MEXICO CITY, MEXICO - OCTOBER 28: Pierre Gasly of France driving the (10) Scuderia AlphaTauri AT03 on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Mexico at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez on October 28, 2022 in Mexico City, Mexico.

Today went pretty smoothly: we could not test anything in the afternoon tyre test, which was a bit of a shame, but hopefully we were able to give some useful information to Pirelli. It is difficult to say where we are at the moment – it looks like we are in our usual positions for a Friday, but I hope we can find something in the set-up and take a step forward for qualifying tomorrow.” Lance Stroll - FP1: 1:21.865, P13; FP2: 1:22.840, P16 “It was a fairly quiet Friday today. There is not much to say about FP2, due to the Pirelli tyre test, but it was certainly good to get some laps in throughout the day. We have improved the car a lot over the year, and it is starting to really show, even if the outright results today do not necessarily reflect that.

His day didn’t improve either as he was forced to park up in the stadium late on in FP2 with an apparent hydraulics issue. Luckily Bottas had a straightforward day for the team, who have their work cut out to get to the root of the issues tonight. Valtteri Bottas - FP1: 1:21.083, P7; FP2: 1:21.993, P9 “The car was feeling pretty good today. Coming into this weekend, I was expecting for it to be a decent track for us, and it seems like so far everything is running smooth, so overall it has been a positive day. We seemed to be in a good place with lap times in both sessions, and hopefully that is a good sign ahead of tomorrow. FP2 was obviously all about learning about the new tyres, which feel very similar to the current ones to me. There is indeed a difference with the tyre pressure, which can clearly be perceived, but apart from that, they feel mostly the same.” Zhou Guanyu - FP1: 1:21.820, P12; FP2: 1:23.369, P20 “Today hasn’t been the easiest day, in fact it has been quite messy out there for me. During FP1 my gear got stuck while I was practicing starts in the pitlane; at first we were okay in FP2, but then we had quite a few small issues in the long run, and eventually at the end of the session I had to stop the car on track because of a hydraulic issue. As a positive, I got to learn the track and our car felt quite strong, so we should be ready for tomorrow and hopefully have a smooth and cleaner day. Upgrades have been working extremely well, especially on the one-lap performance, so I am confident we can have a strong qualifying. Our priority now is to get rid of the issues we experienced today, and then we are good to go.” Next Previous Enlarge 1 / 3 MEXICO CITY, MEXICO - OCTOBER 28: Valtteri Bottas of Finland driving the (77) Alfa Romeo F1 C42 Ferrari on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Mexico at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez on October 28, 2022 in Mexico City, Mexico.

It has been fun though, there have already been a lot of fans here today which is great, so expecting more tomorrow and on Sunday. We still have some work to do, we’re not quite satisfied with our performance overall, but we still have something in us to move up the grid and be able to position ourselves well for the race. I would love some rain, I think it would suit our car very well so yet again we’ll be doing the rain dance.” Kevin Magnussen – FP2: 1:40.084, P11 “We’re back in Mexico and I managed to get some laps in. We had to use the test tires from Pirelli so the running we did today isn’t super relevant, but still I got a good feeling for the track and I got into the rhythm of Mexico City.” Pietro Fittipaldi – FP1: 1:26.766, P20 “It was good to get back in the car – obviously it was only for a few of laps – but it was good to get the feeling of driving a Formula 1 car on a different track, which is an amazing circuit. I’m very happy for the opportunity and I felt very comfortable, very quickly in the car. We weren’t using DRS on the first run and we were running competitively, so I was really happy. Then again, going onto a new tire we were going to make a step but then unfortunately we had the issue. I was happy that I was able to get back into the rhythm quickly in the car and feel good and confident. It was a short FP1 but at least I got a run in, and in Abu Dhabi, I can come back into the car warmed up.” Guenther Steiner, Team Principal “Mick had a very good day today, running through all his test program, so he should be ready for tomorrow. Unfortunately, Pietro’s turbo let go after nine laps which meant he couldn’t do a lot, so we didn’t get that test program going. We had to change the engine afterwards and the team did a fantastic job to get Kevin out with only a 30-minute delay. Kevin could then get a program with the prototype tires in, but there obviously wasn’t enough time to get the race tires on but at least he got back out on track and a little bit of experience.

The Thai driver was then slightly delayed coming out in FP2, and thus didn’t get time to run the medium compound which leaves him playing catch up for tomorrow. Latifi at least managed to gather lots of data for the team after he got his head down and completed a decent amount of laps. Nicholas Latifi – FP1: 1:22.912, P15; FP2: 1:42.317, P20 “Overall today was an okay start to the weekend. It was a little bit disrupted with many yellow and red flags and FP2 having the tyre test which was unrepresentative. A decent Friday to learn about the baseline of the car. There are definitely some clear directions to go into tomorrow to find more lap time.” Logan Sargeant - FP1: 1:24.246, P17 “I was definitely a lot more comfortable coming into today. Everything slowed down a lot and it was easier to build a rhythm and learn the track. All in all, it was a good step forward and good progress from last weekend.” Alex Albon - FP2: 1:41.853, P18 “We did one lap today on the tyres we’re using this weekend so not a very productive day. We’ve got the cooling and the race package ready for the weekend so that’s a positive in terms of getting up to speed. We’re a bit off but that’s expected when considering the one representative lap, so it’s a bit frustrating in some ways but we’ve got a good platform and baseline to work on for tomorrow.” Dave Robson, Head of Vehicle Performance “We have had a very disrupted day, with the red flags costing us some valuable track time. Logan did a very good job this morning in difficult conditions and between him and Nicholas, they were able to evaluate some of the cooling options that we will need this weekend. “Alex was late starting FP2 following an issue with setting the PU cooling system and this meant that he was only able to complete a single timed lap before moving on to the Pirelli tyre testing. Whilst this was frustrating and not ideal preparation for his weekend, he was able to complete the high fuel running and understand what the car limitations will be on Sunday. “With the race car preparation complete, both drivers can concentrate on qualifying preparation during FP3 tomorrow. There is a bit of work to do to tune the car for low fuel, but following some analysis tonight, this will be achievable tomorrow morning.” Next Previous Enlarge 1 / 3 MEXICO CITY, MEXICO - OCTOBER 28: Alexander Albon of Thailand driving the (23) Williams FW44 Mercedes on track during practice ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Mexico at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez on October 28, 2022 in Mexico City, Mexico.

5 things we learned from Friday practice at the Mexico City Grand Prix, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.5-things-we-learned-from-friday-practice-at-the-mexico-city-grand-prix.01OWQ5b2i1j9B5uKjckLwh.html, The atmosphere was electric at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez as practice got under way for the Mexico City Grand Prix, with teams – for the second successive weekend – giving up FP2 to tyre testing for 2023 to pile the focus onto the data gathering in Friday’s opening one-hour session. Usually, low fuel pace has been Ferrari’s domain on a Friday this year, but it was Red Bull who edged it in Mexico, albeit by 0.01s. As a result, though, they are vulnerable on the straights – so it’s likely they will take a little downforce off ahead of qualifying. READ MORE: Alonso’s US Grand Prix penalty overturned after Alpine appeal In low fuel trim, they are fourth best, making Q3 a target for both cars. The race pace is less impressive, as while they are still fourth in the ranking, the data suggests they are just over a second off the pace., The atmosphere was electric at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez as practice got under way for the Mexico City Grand Prix, with teams – for the second successive weekend – giving up FP2 to tyre testing for 2023 to pile the focus onto the data gathering in Friday’s opening one-hour session. So what did we learn? 1. Red Bull pace gives Mexican fans hope of dream result Red Bull arrived in Mexico as the early favourites, the RB18 finding pace on every kind of circuit this year and their two drivers Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez in a fine run of form, having combined to give the team their first constructors’ championship win since 2013. READ MORE: Russell heads second practice in Mexico City as Leclerc crashes out The early signs were positive, with both drivers saying they felt comfortable with the car quickly, and that while there was still work to do, the car was in a good spot upon which to build. Usually, low fuel pace has been Ferrari’s domain on a Friday this year, but it was Red Bull who edged it in Mexico, albeit by 0.01s. In race trim, they fall behind Ferrari, but only by 0.03s. Given they have had better degradation on Sunday, that is unlikely to faze them, and instead give Perez hope he can delight the fans by fighting for a win on home soil. 2. Ferrari in the mix to fight for pole and victory Charles Leclerc’s crash aside, this was one of Ferrari’s strongest Fridays of the year in terms of pure performance, with Carlos Sainz looking very quick straight from the first lap. The Spaniard was very quickly able to find the right spot with the balance of his car, with the focus now on adapting the package to cope best with the high altitude. READ MORE: Leclerc confident FP2 shunt ‘won’t hurt our weekend’ as Ferrari team mate Sainz targets back-to-back poles There’s nothing to choose between them and Red Bull in either qualifying or race trim, with the F1-75 the strongest of all through the high-speed turns. Pole – and maybe the fight for the win – is very much on. 3. Mercedes quickest through slow corners Mercedes took up their now customary position in P3 in both low fuel and race pace metrics on Friday, but they do appear to be at least 0.2s – if not a little more – closer to Red Bull and Ferrari versus Austin. Trackside chief Andrew Shovlin said they were “bumping into a few limits on system temperatures” in the first session, but got things under control for FP2, when George Russell was back in the car after lending it to Nyck de Vries. READ MORE: Russell hails ‘one of our best Fridays’ as Mercedes push for breakthrough victory in Mexico They feel the car is working well on both single lap and long run pace and, according to our data, they seem to have gone hard on the downforce, which has helped them top the slow corner performance charts. As a result, though, they are vulnerable on the straights – so it’s likely they will take a little downforce off ahead of qualifying. 4. Alpine sharpest of the midfield runners Alpine are in a strong position to put some air between themselves and McLaren in the battle for P4 in the constructors’ championship, based on their competitive pace in Friday practice. While Jack Doohan’s maiden Grand Prix weekend track appearance was limited by a power unit issue, it was smoother for race drivers Fernando Alonso and Esteban Ocon – and that meant they have enough data to prepare for the weekend. READ MORE: Alonso’s US Grand Prix penalty overturned after Alpine appeal In low fuel trim, they are fourth best, making Q3 a target for both cars. The race pace is less impressive, as while they are still fourth in the ranking, the data suggests they are just over a second off the pace. 5. Tight fight imminent for lower end points The midfield has been close all year, and that is especially the case here, with Alpine in P4 to Alfa Romeo in P8 – with AlphaTauri, Aston Martin and McLaren in between – separated by just 0.19s in the long runs. Looking at the low fuel efforts, just 0.16s separates the same quintet, with McLaren showing a better turn of pace in this metric and AlphaTauri dropping back from fifth to seventh.

Lawson was driving an AlphaTauri car in the practice session ahead of the Mexico City Grand Prix, but had to pull the car over and climb out before the session was due to end after brakes problems. “I have no brakes, brakes are completely gone,” Lawson said on his radio communications to the team in the pits early in his session, which ended when he stopped the car and climbed out among smoke and flames, with the practice session being red-flagged as a result. Moises Castillo/AP AlphaTauri test driver Liam Lawson, of New Zealand, bails out of his smoking car during a practice run of the Formula One Mexico Grand Prix at the Hermanos Rodriguez racetrack in Mexico City.

Suzuka Super Formula: Nojiri puts one hand on title with pole, https://www.motorsport.com/super-formula/news/suzuka-nojiri-pole-fenestraz-hirakawa/10391961/, He then set a 1m36.020s in the Q2 pole shootout to jump to the top of the leaderboard and boost his chances of becoming Super Formula's first back-to-back champion since Tsugio Matsuda in 2008. Tadasuke Makino (Dandelion) topped his Q1 group but couldn't replicate that speed in Q2, leaving him sixth on the grid ahead of Yuhi Sekiguchi (Impul) and Naoki Yamamoto (Nakajima). Fenestraz's hopes of bridging the points deficit to Nojiri took a major blow when he dropped out of Q1 for the first time this season. Giuliano Alesi likewise recorded his worst grid position of his first full season with TOM'S and will start from 19th place. Suzuka Super Formula (Round 9) - Q2 results:, Listen to this article Mugen driver Nojiri's fifth pole of the season gives him three bonus points, putting him 35 points ahead of nearest championship rival Sacha Fenestraz with 43 left to play for over the remainder of the weekend. With neither Fenestraz nor Ryo Hirakawa scoring any bonus points, it means that a third-place finish on Saturday afternoon would be enough for Nojiri to claim the crown in advance of Sunday's finale. Nojiri struggled to a lowly 16th place in Friday's free practice session, which he described as "really bad", but overnight setup changes appeared to pay dividends as he made it through his Q1 group relatively comfortably in fourth, albeit 0.239s slower than pacesetter Ritomo Miyata. He then set a 1m36.020s in the Q2 pole shootout to jump to the top of the leaderboard and boost his chances of becoming Super Formula's first back-to-back champion since Tsugio Matsuda in 2008. TOM'S driver Miyata proved Nojiri's nearest rival, but lost time in the final sector of his hot lap and fell 0.242s short of a first career pole. Toshiki Oyu, who topped Friday practice, was third-fastest for Nakajima Racing, a further 0.074s back, followed by Sho Tsuboi (Inging) and the second Mugen car of Ukyo Sasahara. Tadasuke Makino (Dandelion) topped his Q1 group but couldn't replicate that speed in Q2, leaving him sixth on the grid ahead of Yuhi Sekiguchi (Impul) and Naoki Yamamoto (Nakajima). Similarly to Makino, title contender Hirakawa outpaced Nojiri in Q1 but managed only the 11th-fastest time in the pole shootout behind Ren Sato (Team Goh) and Nirei Fukuzumi (Drago Corse), the Impul driver ending up almost a full second slower than the points leader. Fenestraz's hopes of bridging the points deficit to Nojiri took a major blow when he dropped out of Q1 for the first time this season. The Franco-Argentine driver could only manage the ninth-fastest time in Q1 Group A, leaving him down in 17th on the grid, one place ahead of his Kondo Racing teammate Kenta Yamashita. Giuliano Alesi likewise recorded his worst grid position of his first full season with TOM'S and will start from 19th place. Saturday's penultimate round of the season is set to get underway at 2.30pm local time (GMT +9). Suzuka Super Formula (Round 9) - Q2 results:

I think we have enough [parts] now with all the penalties we’ve had in the past, so it should be fine.” Sainz, who edged out Leclerc by 0.046s in FP1, was buoyed by his performance in the only representative session of the day as he looks to make it consecutive pole positions after topping qualifying last time out in the United States.

Leclerc lost control at the Esses and spun backwards into the barrier, bringing his session to an end and causing a red-flag for barrier repairs. His team-mate Carlos Sainz topped the first session, while Mercedes' George Russell was quickest in the second. And both Russell and team-mate Lewis Hamilton were happy with their cars after setting strong pace. Russell's fastest overall time in the second session was set on the standard 2022 Pirelli tyres. The session was mainly given over to testing 2023 development rubber on pre-determined blind programmes set by the tyre supplier, but Russell was one of five drivers allowed to use the standard rubber because his car been driven by a young driver in the first session. Hamilton, meanwhile, was fastest of the drivers who exclusively used the 2023 tyres. The seven-time champion was 0.03 seconds faster than Red Bull's Sergio Perez and 0.039secs ahead of the Mexican's team-mate Max Verstappen. In a closely matched field, Leclerc was fourth quickest on the test tyres, just 0.109secs behind Hamilton, with the second Ferrari of Carlos Sainz 0.184secs off the seven-time champion's time. Both Mercedes drivers were positive about their day's work. Hamilton said: "I feel really, really good. Generally had a really good session today. I really enjoyed driving around the track, the car is feeling better and better as we work more through it and understand it more." Russell added: "The car's working well at the moment and I got a good feel around here, the pace is looking relatively strong. "I would like to think it is podium possible at least. It is probably one of if not our best Friday of the year." 'People choose narrative that suits' - Horner on budget cap fine Russell setting the pace on 2022 rubber while most ran on the development tyres repeated a trend from last weekend's United States Grand Prix, when there was also a 2023 tyre test in second practice and the fastest time was also set on the 2022 rubber. Russell headed Alpha Tauri's Yuki Tsunoda and Alpine's Esteban Ocon, all on 2022 tyres, in the second session. In the first session, run on 2022 rubber but on a dusty and dirty track, Sainz was 0.047 seconds ahead of Leclerc, followed by Perez, Verstappen, Hamilton and Fernando Alonso's Alpine. Verstappen had a spin at the Esses in the first session, one corner on from Leclerc's later incident, but managed to stay out of the barriers. The world champion also had an oversteer moment at Turn Five later in the session as he struggled on the low-grip track. Perez and Verstappen, who set identical times to the thousandth of a second, were 0.12secs behind Sainz, with Hamilton 0.142secs off the pace and Alonso 0.192secs behind. The young drivers took part in the first session because all teams are required by regulation to devote two Friday practice sessions in the season to running drivers who have no more than two grands prix experience. The quickest was New Zealander Liam Lawson in the Alpha Tauri in 16th place, followed by Williams' Logan Sargeant, set to be their second driver in 2023 if he qualifies for an F1 licence and Mercedes' Nick de Vries, who is driving for Alpha Tauri next year. Alpine's Mick Doohan and Haas driver Pietro Fittipaldi, who both had their sessions curtailed by technical problems - as did Lawson - were the slowest.
Formula One's governing body hits Red Bull with $7 million fine for exceeding cost cap, https://www.foxnews.com/sports/fia-hands-red-bull-7m-f1-fine-aero-testing-reduction-for-cost-cap-breach, Those are some of the expenditures Red Bull claimed Friday it improperly misrepresented when submitting its 2021 financial report. It led to a breach of Formula One's spending cap, set at $145 million for its debut season, and penalties handed down by the series governing body. The penalties were deliberately delayed one week out of respect of last week's death of Red Bull co-founder Dietrich Mateschitz. Red Bull has already wrapped up both a second F1 title with Verstappen and the constructors' championship with three races remaining this season. Most teams believed that if Red Bull only received a monetary penalty it would encourage others to deliberately overspend and simply pay the fine as punishment., Fancy catering and energy drinks. Social security contributions and medical treatments for an employee that survived an illness. Those are some of the expenditures Red Bull claimed Friday it improperly misrepresented when submitting its 2021 financial report. It led to a breach of Formula One's spending cap, set at $145 million for its debut season, and penalties handed down by the series governing body. The FIA on Friday ordered the F1 championship team to pay a $7 million fine and forfeit wind tunnel time as punishment for overspending by $1.8 million during Max Verstappen’s first championship season. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM The FIA found 13 discrepancies in an audit of over 75,000 line items on Red Bull's 2021 financial report, team principal Christian Horner said. But he was adamant the areas of overspending had zero benefit on team performance. He called the penalties "draconian" and said the cost cap structure inherited by first-year FIA president Mohammed bin Sulayem was "immature." Horner also strongly intimated Red Bull was targeted because of its on-track success and blasted the initial leak that the FIA was investigating a potential spending breach. He said the weeks of paddock sniping and cheating accusations damaged Red Bull's reputation, and the team only "begrudgingly" settled with the FIA to end the saga that has engrossed the world's top motorsports series. MAX VERSTAPPEN TAKES HOME US GRAND PRIX TITLE IN RECORD-TYING VICTORY "Not one penny was spent on performance," said Horner, who shooed away complaints the penalty was too soft. "That's an enormous amount of money that is payable within 30 days," Horner said of the fine. He said the loss of 10% time in the wind tunnel "represents anywhere between a quarter and a half a second worth of lap time. That has direct effect on next year's car. Horner had compulsive note-keeping on the entire process, noting Red Bull was informed it was over the cap exactly 19 minutes after Verstappen won his second F1 title Oct. 9. The FIA on Friday also fined Aston Martin $450,000 for a "procedural" violation on its 2021 expenditure submission. The FIA found Aston Martin had incorrectly excluded or adjusted 12 separate costs, among them a signing bonus, the costs of desks and chairs, and, like Red Bull, financial discrepancies in catering. The FIA noted neither team acted "in bad faith, dishonesty or in a fraudulent manner" in their respective breaches. The penalties were deliberately delayed one week out of respect of last week's death of Red Bull co-founder Dietrich Mateschitz. Coincidentally, Horner argued Friday that the Red Bull drinks consumed by the race team and its guests shouldn't count because they come from a different part of the company. To hear Horner's nearly 50-minute long defense of Red Bull's spending, the saga seems trite. He spent a great deal of time defending high-end catering services and included a reference to Red Bull's sick pay policy. Horner said the team paid sick leave to an employee as an excludable cost, but "had the person died, and thankfully they didn't, the cost would have been excluded." Either way, the penalties in no way satisfied Red Bull rivals, many of whom called for harsh penalties ranging from stripping Verstappen of last year’s title and a reduction in future Red Bull spending. Red Bull has already wrapped up both a second F1 title with Verstappen and the constructors' championship with three races remaining this season. FERNANDO ALONSO, LANCE STROLL INVOLVED IN SCARY CRASH AT F1 RACE McLaren head Zak Brown had accused Red Bull of cheating by breaching the spending cap in a letter Brown sent to the FIA. The cost cap was put in place as a competition equalizer to prevent the larger, heavily-funded teams from outspending the smaller organizations struggling to keep up. Most teams believed that if Red Bull only received a monetary penalty it would encourage others to deliberately overspend and simply pay the fine as punishment. Horner was incensed by Brown's letter, which Horner said was just another baseless allegation that had led to Red Bull employees' children being bullied at school. "It's still a mystery to me how a team can publicly say they submitted comfortably within the cap and what is in contention is some $200,000, when in fact they were $1.8 million over, which is not an insignificant number," said Brown. "There is a competitive advantage that has been gained by that." Horner said the saga has not distracted Verstappen or teammate Sergio Perez, who on Sunday is trying to become the first Mexican driver to win the Mexico City Grand Prix. He's also trying to finish second in the standings behind Verstappen. Horner said Verstappen fairly won his 2021 championship. Verstappen, meanwhile, said he knows there are many who will never accept that title. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Verstappen beat Lewis Hamilton in a controversial finish when the since-fired race director made a late race change in protocol during the season finale that allowed Verstappen to pass Hamilton for the win and the championship. "From my side, I can (accept it), probably they can’t and will never be able to and that’s a problem for them to deal with," Verstappen said.

Having missed FP1 to give outgoing Mercedes reserve driver Nyck de Vries some more track time, Russell led the way on 2022-spec soft tyres in second practice, with the Briton explaining that his W13 is “working well” and has a “good feel” around the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez.

It’s not going to be a straightforward Saturday and Sunday, for sure.”

Formula 1 2022 results - Mexican Grand Prix: Free Practice 2, https://www.planetf1.com/news/formula-1-2022-results-mexican-grand-prix-fp2/, George Russell used his allotted time on the soft tyre to top FP2 in Mexico, a session geared towards testing the Pirelli 2023 prototypes. Russell was one of five drivers who sat out FP1 to make way for a ‘rookie driver’, who all therefore had 45 minutes available to them in the 90-minute FP2 session to run the 2022 tyres. Each driver would need to use 45 minutes of their session though for the Pirelli prototypes. He fortunately walked away fine as the session was red flagged. The session would resume with 38 minutes remaining on the clock, Russell, Tsunoda and Ocon the top three after their stints on the soft rubber., George Russell used his allotted time on the soft tyre to top FP2 in Mexico, a session geared towards testing the Pirelli 2023 prototypes. Russell was one of five drivers who sat out FP1 to make way for a ‘rookie driver’, who all therefore had 45 minutes available to them in the 90-minute FP2 session to run the 2022 tyres. It was Russell then who won that battle on the softs, though it was not a session which passed without drama, Charles Leclerc binning his Ferrari into the barriers to trigger the red flags. As was the case in Austin, FP2 at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez focused on testing the Pirelli 2023 prototype tyres, the session running for 90 minutes rather than the standard 60. Max Verstappen headed a flock of drivers to dive into the action from the start, though Russell and Esteban Ocon began on the current Pirelli rubber having sat out for Nyck de Vries and Jack Doohan respectively in FP1. Russell and Ocon, along with Yuki Tsunoda, Alex Albon and Kevin Magnussen were permitted run time on the 2022 tyres as a result of them all giving up their seats in FP1. Each driver would need to use 45 minutes of their session though for the Pirelli prototypes. Charles Leclerc's mechanics will probably have a long night ahead of them after this crash.#MexicoGP #F1pic.twitter.com/69XsQmSb1h — PlanetF1 (@Planet_F1) October 28, 2022 As the session passed the half-hour mark and all seemed calm out there, Leclerc lost control of his Ferrari at Turn 8, sliding into the barrier and making a mess of the rear end of that F1-75. He fortunately walked away fine as the session was red flagged. The session would resume with 38 minutes remaining on the clock, Russell, Tsunoda and Ocon the top three after their stints on the soft rubber. And that remained the top three as the chequered flag brought an end to FP2, that happening a few minutes early as a hydraulic failure forced Zhou Guanyu to bring his Alfa Romeo to a halt.

Mexican GP: Russell tops second F1 practice Leclerc shunts, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/mexican-gp-russell-second-f1-practice-leclerc-shunts/10391904/, Drivers were required to run identical programmes through the session, comprising two five-lap runs before then going for two eight-lap runs. Russell was joined by AlphaTauri’s Yuki Tsunoda, Alpine’s Esteban Ocon and Williams’ Alex Albon in running the 2022 tyres through the first half of the session. Russell set a fastest lap time of 1m19.970s on the soft compound tyre, finishing eight-tenths of a second clear of Tsunoda in second place. Ocon was a further four-tenths of a second behind in third for Alpine, the trio having completed their initial runs on mediums. Lewis Hamilton set the fastest lap time on the prototype tyre during his third stint after pitting halfway through his second run., Listen to this article The extended 90-minute session saw drivers focus on running Pirelli’s prototype rubber for next year, building on the findings from Austin one week ago with a softer selection of compounds. Drivers were required to run identical programmes through the session, comprising two five-lap runs before then going for two eight-lap runs. Russell was one of only five drivers permitted to use the 2022 tyre compounds during FP2 at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez on Friday afternoon, having sat out FP1 for Mercedes reserve driver Nyck de Vries. Russell was joined by AlphaTauri’s Yuki Tsunoda, Alpine’s Esteban Ocon and Williams’ Alex Albon in running the 2022 tyres through the first half of the session. Russell set a fastest lap time of 1m19.970s on the soft compound tyre, finishing eight-tenths of a second clear of Tsunoda in second place. Ocon was a further four-tenths of a second behind in third for Alpine, the trio having completed their initial runs on mediums. While the rest of the field was focused on Pirelli’s 2023 tyres, the running was interrupted 33 minutes into the session when a red flag was thrown after Leclerc crashed heavily at Turn 7, losing the rear of his Ferrari F1-75 car when turning in. Leclerc had been three laps in to his third stint on the Pirelli prototype tyre, but impacted the barrier at the entry to the esses with the rear of his car, causing damage to the rear wing and left corner. The Monegasque quickly reported over the radio that he was OK, but said: “The car is not.” The damage to the barrier meant it took 20 minutes before running could resume, by which point all drivers were left focusing on Pirelli prototypes through the remainder of the session. Lewis Hamilton set the fastest lap time on the prototype tyre during his third stint after pitting halfway through his second run. The seven-time world champion finished 1.5 seconds down on Mercedes team-mate Russell at the head of the field. He narrowly beat Red Bull driver and home favourite Sergio Perez, who was just seven-hundredths of a second further back having reported struggles with rear locking earlier in the session. Perez was also seen trying a number of different lines at Turn 1 after noting some bouncing at the end of the straight. Perez’s Red Bull team-mate Max Verstappen followed in sixth place, ending the session within a tenth of 2021 title rival Hamilton’s best effort on the prototypes. Leclerc’s lap time set during his second stint on the prototype tyres was still good enough for seventh place ahead of Ferrari team-mate Carlos Sainz, while Valtteri Bottas and Pierre Gasly rounded out the top 10. Fernando Alonso ended FP2 in 11th place for Alpine ahead of Aston Martin’s Sebastian Vettel, while Albon could only muster 13th after only completing a short run on the 2022 softs before switching to the prototype tyres for Williams. McLaren duo Lando Norris and Daniel Ricciardo ended the session 14th and 15th respectively ahead of Lance Stroll in the second Aston Martin, with Mick Schumacher following in 17th for Haas. Kevin Magnussen was limited to 20 laps through the session after losing the opening half an hour due to an engine change by his Haas team following the stoppage in FP1 when Pietro Fittipaldi was in the car. Magnussen will take a five-place grid penalty for Sunday’s race as a result of the engine change, which was outside of his allocation for the season. Due to the lost time, Haas opted against running him on the 2022 tyres and instead focused on Pirelli prototype running, leaving him 18th overall only ahead of Williams’ Nicholas Latifi and Alfa Romeo’s Zhou Guanyu. Zhou brought out a red flag with less than two minutes left on the clock in FP2 after reporting a hydraulic failure, pulling to the side of the track in Foro Sol after being instructed to stop his car.

Seidl not interested in Red Bull 'fairytale' | Penalty doesn't fit their breach, https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1015855/1/seidl-not-interested-red-bull-fairytale-penalty-doesn-t-fit-their-breach, Red Bull “begrudgingly” struck an Accepted Breach Agreement (ABA) with the FIA following extensive talks ahead of the Mexico City Grand Prix, with team principal Christian Horner calling the penalty “enormous” and “draconian”. But Seidl doesn’t feel the punishment fits the crime and hopes any further breaches of F1’s financial regulations are met with more severe sanctions. Nine teams got it right and it was clear one team was in breach, so that’s a positive outcome. Although he did not reference Red Bull directly in the leaked letter, Horner took aim at his rival’s comments during a fiery press conference in Austin last weekend. On Friday, Horner suggested up to six teams could be in breach of this year’s $140m budget cap, but Seidl dismissed his counterpart’s claim., Governing body the FIA announced on Friday that Red Bull have been handed a $7m fine and a 10 percent reduction in aerodynamic testing time for the next 12 months after being found guilty of breaking F1’s $145m spending limit last year.

Is Hamilton No Longer the Best Wet Weather Driver? Video of Is Hamilton No Longer the Best Wet Weather Driver? But Seidl doesn’t feel the punishment fits the crime and hopes any further breaches of F1’s financial regulations are met with more severe sanctions. Asked by Sky Sports’ Ted Kravitz if he had listened to Horner’s news conference ahead of F1 practice in Mexico City, Seidl replied: “No, I didn’t listen to it because I can imagine it was another fairytale hour, probably. Not really interested in that. “In the end, on a positive side I think it’s good to see the FIA did a good job in terms of doing the audit. Nine teams got it right and it was clear one team was in breach, so that’s a positive outcome. “But on a negative side, it’s also clear, from my point of view, that the penalty doesn’t fit the breach. I just hope moving forward we have stricter penalties in place.” McLaren CEO Zak Brown wrote a letter to the FIA two weeks ago in which he stressed that any breach of the cost cap would “constitute cheating” and called for harsh punishments. Although he did not reference Red Bull directly in the leaked letter, Horner took aim at his rival’s comments during a fiery press conference in Austin last weekend. On Friday, Horner suggested up to six teams could be in breach of this year’s $140m budget cap, but Seidl dismissed his counterpart’s claim. “There’s absolutely no reason to be in breach this year,” Seidl said. “We had good discussions earlier this year with all teams, the FIA and F1 regarding these topics. “That’s why the cap was adjusted and it was also made clear from all teams and the FIA’s side that there is absolutely no reason, after this positive decisions in the interests of the sport, that there is any breach at the end of the year. “I just hope if there is any breach, it ends up being appropriate penalties.”

Mark Hughes: Ferrari's Mexico Friday pace edge is deceptive, https://the-race.com/formula-1/mark-hughes-ferraris-mexico-friday-edge-is-deceptive/, Max Verstappen’s sector times suggest he was potentially fastest, had he not suffered a spin in his first push lap on the softs. Even with a flat-spotted set of tyres, his subsequent lap was only around 0.1s off. With de Vries not getting a clean sequence on his three-lap run, there is no representative long run indication from Mercedes. As such Fernando Alonso’s Alpine looks clearly best of the rest in both single lap and long running. Long run averagesLeclerc 1m24.152s – 6 laps – softsPerez 1m24.364s – 5 laps – softsVerstappen 1m24.699s – 5 laps – hardsSainz 1m24.780s – 4 laps – hardsAlonso 1m24.889s – 6 laps – softsNorris 1m25.097s – 5 laps – softsPractice 1 Results, Only the most rudimentary of analysis can be made from Mexican Grand Prix Friday practice one, with the second session again devoted to testing of the 2023 Formula 1 tyres, as at Austin. What was most noteworthy is that no one used the medium tyre. It is expected to be the favoured tyre around here and with only three sets each allocated for the whole weekend no one was prepared to burn a set up. On a circuit so dirty because it sees such little use, the hard was by far the more logical starting tyre. The headline times showing the Ferraris 1-2 should be taken with some caution. Max Verstappen’s sector times suggest he was potentially fastest, had he not suffered a spin in his first push lap on the softs. Even with a flat-spotted set of tyres, his subsequent lap was only around 0.1s off. Sergio Perez – around whom there is a big push from the team to secure its first 1-2 in the drivers’ championship – was also compromised with a big moment on his first push lap and his identical time to Verstappen was not his best potential either. Lewis Hamilton’s fifth-fastest time on the same tenth as the Red Bulls came on a set of tyres which had been partially used, as he’d been forced to abandon his original push lap because of a red flag, so he too likely has time in hand. George Russell’s Mercedes was handled in this session by reserve Nyck de Vries, who didn’t run a set of soft tyres and whose times are therefore totally unrepresentative. The long runs were so short that the drop-off of the soft tyre wasn’t really apparent in the numbers, so flattering its performance relative to the hard, but even on the hards Verstappen was saying his fronts were dropping off by the end of his five-lap run. With two red flags, only about half the field managed to squeeze in any long runs and this didn’t include Hamilton. With de Vries not getting a clean sequence on his three-lap run, there is no representative long run indication from Mercedes. As such Fernando Alonso’s Alpine looks clearly best of the rest in both single lap and long running. Long run averages Leclerc 1m24.152s – 6 laps – softs Perez 1m24.364s – 5 laps – softs Verstappen 1m24.699s – 5 laps – hards Sainz 1m24.780s – 4 laps – hards Alonso 1m24.889s – 6 laps – softs Norris 1m25.097s – 5 laps – softs Practice 1 Results

October 31, 2019 The FIA Cost Cap regulations are announced as part of the provisional 2021 rules. The 2021 Technical Regulations were delayed to 2022 due to the global pandemic, but the Financial Regulations would remain in place. Excluding marketing costs, race driver fees and costs of the teams' three highest-paid personnel, the cap was set at $175 million for the 2021 season – and then on May 27, 2020, it was reduced to $147.4m.

The team voluntarily disclosed their breach of the regulations – they failed to submit annual reports by the deadline of March 31, 2022 – and became the first team to be fined for a breach, to the tune of $25,000.
Horner on why he feels Red Bull's Cost Cap breach penalties were 'draconian' – and why his team have accepted them ..., https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.horner-on-why-he-feels-red-bulls-cost-cap-breach-penalties-were-draconian.nKSHAWUlivKZ4iANOKgSP.html, On Friday in Mexico City, Red Bull's Christian Horner spoke about the penalty handed to his team for breaching the Financial Regulations. Christian HornerHow Red Bull breached the Cost Cap Horner explained that the team had submitted their financial reports as early as April 2021. And the team boss maintained that there was no advantage gained by Red Bull for breaching the Cost Cap. Horner was adamant the overspend hadn't benefitted Red Bull on trackHow tax, catering, sick pay and redundancy caused confusion "Our overspend relates in several areas: one, of course was the tax, that I’ve mentioned. Catering within Red Bull has always been a benefit that has been provided by the group… free food and beverage has always been provided., On Friday in Mexico City, Red Bull's Christian Horner spoke about the penalty handed to his team for breaching the Financial Regulations. Red Bull were found to have exceeded the 2021 Cost Cap by less than 5%, specifically 1.6%, with the FIA having acknowledged that the team did not correctly report their Notional Tax Credit, which would have meant they exceeded the Cost Cap by 0.37%. READ MORE: Red Bull enter Agreement with FIA over breach of 2021 Financial Regulations The 2022 constructors' champions must pay $7 million to the FIA within 30 days, and they face a further 10% reduction in their allocated Restricted Wind Tunnel Testing and Restricted Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) limits. According to Horner, who held a press conference to address the team's penalty, here's how the saga unfolded. I think we have 52 pages of financial regulations and anybody who’s read them… there are elements that are open to interpretation. Christian Horner How Red Bull breached the Cost Cap Horner explained that the team had submitted their financial reports as early as April 2021. He then added: "There was no feedback from that, and so therefore based on that, those policies we felt were adopted as nothing had been spoken up about, and therefore we adopted the same methodology in our March 2022 submission for the 2021 season. "Through April and June, obviously the FIA… had come and looked at our accounts and books and within this submission there is in excess of 75,000 line items – just to give you an idea of the scale of it – that have to be entered. READ MORE: Aston Martin enter Agreement over procedural breach of 2021 Cost Cap "So basically, April and June as I say this year we didn’t hear anything. The first that we actually heard was… on the back end of September for some preliminary findings, where some clarifications were requested, which we officially responded to the 13 points that had been raised. And obviously felt again at that time we’d answered all the questions that had been raised by the FIA in this first year of the cap. Catering costs, we believed, were excluded Christian Horner "I think we have 52 pages of financial regulations and anybody who’s read them… there are elements that are open to interpretation. We’ve applied accounting interpretations that, for example, our auditors have been happy with but that’s had a different treatment from the FIA. If we made a mistake it was assuming that the FIA is like an audit process, and it’s not, an the treatment has been very different to that which you would receive from an auditor. As I say, there’s lessons for all concerned out of this." Horner pointed out that the FIA stated: "There is no accusation or evidence that RBR [Red Bull Racing] has sought at any time to act in bad faith, dishonestly or in fraudulent manner, nor has it wilfully concealed any information from the Cost Cap Administration." He added: "So we haven’t hidden stuff; we’ve made our interim submissions, we’ve been through the process. Perhaps we expected more, perhaps we should have asked more – that’s part of this process. And the team boss maintained that there was no advantage gained by Red Bull for breaching the Cost Cap. "Not one penny was spent on the performance of the vehicle, not one penny was spent on the performance of the car. and I think that I’m astounded that there are no other teams that have found themselves in this position but good for them, that eight of them are fully complied. Did we see any on-track performance? No, we didn’t." Horner was adamant the overspend hadn't benefitted Red Bull on track How tax, catering, sick pay and redundancy caused confusion "Our overspend relates in several areas: one, of course was the tax, that I’ve mentioned. Two, was a change to the regulations in June, after the submission, that had we been allowed to resubmit would have had a benefit to us in the region of £1.2 million of unused parts and the way those unused parts had been accounted and treated and we believe had been adopted by other teams in their submissions. "Catering costs, a lot had been made that we’d given our staff too much food this year. Catering costs, we believed, were excluded. And again just to put into context, when we submitted our submission, we were £3.7 million under the submission, under the threshold. Catering within Red Bull has always been a benefit that has been provided by the group… free food and beverage has always been provided. Therefore… we viewed it as an excludable cost. Aggressive, but we felt it was acceptable. The FIA took a different viewpoint on that and said that food not excludable. "We had a difference of opinion on sick pay; we have always taken a view that we wanted to support our staff in sickness and in health” "We had a difference of opinion on sick pay; we have always taken a view that we wanted to support our staff in sickness and in health, and, when members of staff have been on long-term [leave] we supported them, as we will continue to do in the future. We felt that sick [pay], the role paid no function in the Grand Prix team in the period of eight months, [so it] was an excludable cost. Unfortunately, the regulations can be interpreted in two ways: had the person died, which thankfully they didn’t, the cost would have been excludable. Thankfully they didn’t die; therefore the cost was includable for that period. "Another point that we had a differing opinion on was leavers and redundancy, and the movement of staff between companies. This sometimes happens between Grand Prix teams that have separate entities. So for example we had a senior member of staff on a lock-in contract, a fixed-term contract, that was offered a Hollywood-style offer from another team and, at that point you can see that their heart and mind is not within your company, so they were transferred from the Formula 1 activity into our advanced technology [division]… "The individual then left the company from there, but the time they spent not in the Formula 1 company was included in the cap. Again, something we felt was an excludable cost," explained Horner. We might have lost 10% in ATR, but I think we’ve gained 25% in motivation from every single staff member in Milton Keynes Christian Horner How the penalty may affect Red Bull "It’s a hit, it’s a handicap, and we are going to have to work incredibly hard," said Horner. "It gives an advantage to our competitors, which is why they were pushing so hard for a draconian penalty, and we’re going to have to work incredibly hard within the time that we have available and we're going to have to be efficient with our time, we’re going to have to be efficient with the runs we choose to do within our wind tunnel. So I have full belief in our team, in the capability of our team – I think they’ve demonstrated that time and time again. There were other sporting penalties that were available to the FIA but this one was obviously lobbied hard for by our competitors and they felt this hit us the hardest. Horner said the penalties would have a "material impact" on the team's 2023 car development "I’m sure for [rivals] it won't be enough; I’m sure if you burned our wind tunnel down it wouldn’t be enough. But this is a penalty the FIA, after an awful lot of dialogue with them, they know the impact it has on us… this has a material impact on our car performance for next year. "As I say, it’s difficult to put a lap time figure but one could assume… there could be anywhere between 0.25 and 0.5 of a second. But what we’ve lost in ATR [Aerodynamic Testing Restrictions], we’ve gained in motivation. I’ve never seen a more motivated group of individuals that have done an outstanding job last year and this year, in a regulation change that has probably been the biggest in the last 40 years, and we might have lost 10% in ATR, but I think we’ve gained 25% in motivation from every single staff member in Milton Keynes." I think what we have set is a precedent, and it sets a precedent for 2022 Christian Horner Why Red Bull didn't appeal, and the effect of their punishment on F1 "We accept that this set of regulations is immature, we accept that there are interpretations, we accept that this FIA administration has inherited these regulations, and indeed there’s an awful lot of work that needs to be done for the future. Had we dragged it out through the administration process, to go to effectively appeal, that could’ve taken months, and then beyond that the International Court of Appeal could have taken further months. So we could have been looking at a 12-month period to have this situation closed. "The amount of speculation and commenting and sniping that has been going on in the paddock, we felt it’s in everybody’s interests – in our interests, in the FIA’s interests, in Formula 1’s interests – to say we’ve closed the book. We close the book here and today, we accept the penatlies, begrudgingly, but we accept them. Horner said the team “begrudgingly” accepted the penalties
Wolff: Red Bull's 'reputational damage' a deterrent for rivals breaking cost cap, https://www.espn.com/f1/story/_/id/34897289/red-bull-reputational-damage-deterrent-rivals-breaking-cost-cap, MEXICO CITY -- Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff believes the reputational damage Red Bull sustained after breaching Formula One's cost cap last year is a big enough deterrent to stop teams doing the same in the future. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner referred to the penalty as "draconian" but said his team "begrudgingly" accepted the sanction in the interests of drawing a line under the issue. Wolff indicated that he believed the penalty was somewhat lenient but said the reputational damage suffered by Red Bull as a result of the breach would be enough to deter other teams intentionally breaching the cap to gain an advantage. "We've been in the fortunate situation that we've won the championship so for 18 months we had 7% less than Red Bull for over one and a half year. Asked for his thoughts on the penalty process, Wolff added: "I think the most important thing for me is that there is a robust governance., MEXICO CITY -- Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff believes the reputational damage Red Bull sustained after breaching Formula One's cost cap last year is a big enough deterrent to stop teams doing the same in the future. Red Bull was fined $7 million and had its aerodynamic testing allowance reduced by 10 percent for the next 12 months after it submitted accounts that were found to be 1.6 percent over the $145 million cap in 2021. The FIA issued the penalty on Friday, taking into account Red Bull's omission of a tax credit in its submission that would have reduced the overspend to 0.37 percent had it been accounted for. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner referred to the penalty as "draconian" but said his team "begrudgingly" accepted the sanction in the interests of drawing a line under the issue. Wolff indicated that he believed the penalty was somewhat lenient but said the reputational damage suffered by Red Bull as a result of the breach would be enough to deter other teams intentionally breaching the cap to gain an advantage. "I think what you see is that beyond the sporting penalty and the financial fine there's also a reputational damage and in a world of transparency and good governance that's just not on anymore," Wolff told Sky Sports. "And compliance-wise, in whatever team you are, you're responsible for representing a brand, your employees, your partners, and that's why for us it wouldn't be a business case." F1's aerodynamic testing rules operate on a sliding scale, with the first-placed team getting the least capacity for the following six months and the last-placed team getting the most time. Wolff expects Red Bull to pay a price in performance as a result of the penalty, which will be added on top of the deficit in wind tunnel time Red Bull will already have as the reigning champions next year. Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff. Gongora/NurPhoto via Getty Images "Any reduction on wind tunnel time will have an impact in performance," he added. "We've been in the fortunate situation that we've won the championship so for 18 months we had 7% less than Red Bull for over one and a half year. "Overall it all adds up and if you look at Ferrari at the moment, they were 6th the previous year and got massively more performance from the extra time they had. So, now we're unfortunately benefiting from being 3rd on the road, getting 14% more than the leader and now we have more 10%, so that is quite a lot. But you need to see where you utilize it." Asked for his thoughts on the penalty process, Wolff added: "I think the most important thing for me is that there is a robust governance. "They didn't budge an eyelid, they did just follow the process, how it went, Federico [Lodi, FIA head of financial regulations] and his team, Shaila Ann [Rao, FIA interim secretary general for sport] and Nikolas [Tombazis, single-seater technical head], I think they were absolutely good in assessing -- I know how rigorous they were with us, all throughout the year, "That was a difficult process and when I'm seeing 13 positions that were wrong, with us it wasn't the case. And it's just good to see there is a penalty, whether we deem it to be too low or too high."

Alpine: "Justice prevailed" on Alonso F1 mirror penalty, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/szafnauer-justice-prevailed-on-alonso-f1-mirror-penalty/10391844/, Alpine then protested the decision on the basis that the Haas protest was put in late. The admissibility of the Alpine protest was considered on Thursday in a virtual hearing conducted by the original Austin stewards. They rejected the protest, but Alpine then countered with a request for a right of review. "I think the comparison is more front wing endplate to front wing endplate. Sergio had his front wing endplate come off, and wasn't shown the black and orange flag., Listen to this article Alonso was originally given a post-race 30-second time penalty after a protest by Haas that claimed the Spaniard's car was in a dangerous condition after he drove for many laps with a flapping right mirror, and then finished the race with no rear visibility after it came loose and fell off. Haas also protested the Red Bull of Sergio Perez, which ran for six laps with a damaged endplate that eventually flew off. The Haas protests were sparked by frustration after the team lost points through a series of three black-and-orange flags for Kevin Magnussen at different races, all due to endplate damage. The stewards rejected the Perez protest, but Alonso was excluded from his seventh place. Alpine then protested the decision on the basis that the Haas protest was put in late. In fact, it was late because race director Niels Wittich had erroneously told Haas that it had an hour to get the protest in when the actual limit was 30 minutes. The admissibility of the Alpine protest was considered on Thursday in a virtual hearing conducted by the original Austin stewards. They rejected the protest, but Alpine then countered with a request for a right of review. That was accepted, and late on Thursday evening it was finally decided that Alpine had a good case, and Alonso's penalty was cancelled and the original results reinstated. Asked if the team had got the outcome it deserved Szafnauer said there was a bigger picture. "I think we got the result that F1 deserved, really," he told Motorsport.com. "I believe justice prevailed, even though I have my natural biases, because I'm for this team and wanted to see him in seventh. "But the protest was put in out of time, and it should have never been heard. And that was our argument. And I think the FIA recognised that, and made the right decision." Otmar Szafnauer, Team Principal, Alpine F1, in the team principals Press Conference Photo by: FIA Pool Szafnauer agreed that there were some grey areas in the whole process. "Definitely some anomalies. And I think in the end, when we took our time to look at all the rules, and how they're applied, the right decision was made." The FIA has confirmed that its president Mohammed Ben Sulayem has instigated a review of the use of black-and-orange flags to oblige drivers with damage to pit. Szafnauer acknowledged that there was an issue, but suggested that the Perez situation in Austin was closer to the problems that Haas has experienced this year. "Well, I think that it should be better defined, so that the decisions from the FIA are more consistent. And it's not really, for us. "I think the comparison is more front wing endplate to front wing endplate. Sergio had his front wing endplate come off, and wasn't shown the black and orange flag. I think that happened to Haas before. "So there's some inconsistencies there. But what we have to do is learn from those, and in the future, start becoming more consistent, so that everybody knows what to expect." Szafnauer downplayed any suggestion that cars with mirror damage or missing mirrors should receive the black-and-orange flag. "All that stuff we have to define. I mean, me personally, I've raced in 55 open-wheel races, and I've raced some without mirrors, or a mirror. And I don't think it's that much more dangerous. "Often you use your mirrors to place your car such that the guy behind you can't overtake you. And if you only have one mirror to do that, you're a bit more cautious! "So it's not necessarily that one mirror is much more dangerous. But my point is, we have to define what that danger is."
Why unapologetic Red Bull went for cost cap 'plea bargain', https://the-race.com/formula-1/why-unapologetic-red-bull-went-for-cost-cap-plea-bargain/, The 13 ways Red Bull got its cost cap calculation wrong Read moreThis is why Red Bull believes the issue comes down to a breach of just £432,652 or 0.37% of the budget, and even that has been disputed by Red Bull as its interpretation of the rules resulted in an initial submission that was several million below the cap. “It’s such a new set of regulations, would the information have been any different at an appeal panel?” Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said. “The cost cap is an important part of Formula 1’s success in the future. The rules around an ABA limit what penalties can be applied and do not allow for a points deduction or more significantly a future cost cap reduction, both of which could be possible punishments if a case goes to the Cost Cap Adjudication Panel. “We’ve taken our pounding in public, we’ve taken a very public pounding with the accusations that have been made through other teams., The potential for “even more draconian” punishment and a desire to avoid dragging out the process contributed to Red Bull accepting the FIA’s Accepted Breach Agreement offer after breaching Formula 1’s cost cap. Red Bull has been found guilty of spending more than it was allowed to in 2021, the first year of F1’s new financial regulations, and been punished with a $7million and a 10% reduction in the aerodynamic testing limits it is entitled to for the next 12 months. The FIA determined that Red Bull had exceeded the cost cap by £1.8million but that £1.4m of this would have been correctly accounted for had the team applied the “correct treatment” for a notional tax credit. The 13 ways Red Bull got its cost cap calculation wrong Read more This is why Red Bull believes the issue comes down to a breach of just £432,652 or 0.37% of the budget, and even that has been disputed by Red Bull as its interpretation of the rules resulted in an initial submission that was several million below the cap. Red Bull has previously been adamant that submission was accurate but opted to accept the FIA’s proposal for an ‘Accepted Breach Agreement’ rather than fight its corner and have the matter judged by an independent panel. “It’s such a new set of regulations, would the information have been any different at an appeal panel?” Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said. “And of course the suite of penalties that they have available within that panel could be even more draconian. “Whilst we feel hard done by, and we feel that there were absolutely mitigating circumstances with this, to drag that process out we didn’t feel was in anybody’s interest. “It’s been a huge learning experience for us and I’m sure others have learned watching from the sidelines. “The cost cap is an important part of Formula 1’s success in the future. “But it needs to be applied in the right way, and to potentially blow that apart as well would not be the right thing to do.” Is Red Bull’s F1 cost cap penalty adequate? Our verdict Read more Horner’s admission that the prospect of a harsher penalty influenced the decision to enter an ABA is unsurprising. The rules around an ABA limit what penalties can be applied and do not allow for a points deduction or more significantly a future cost cap reduction, both of which could be possible punishments if a case goes to the Cost Cap Adjudication Panel. This is where the ABA represents an F1 cost cap equivalent of a ‘plea bargain’, whereby the FIA can trade off a slightly more lenient punishment against a rapid conclusion to the process that Red Bull must accept and cannot challenge. Given the focus on Red Bull in recent weeks around its rules breach, initially speculatively and then once it was confirmed, Horner said that drawing a line under the matter was a priority for the team as well. “We accept that this set of regulations is immature, we accept that there are interpretations, we accept that this FIA administration has inherited these regulations,” he said. “And indeed, there’s an awful lot of work that needs to be done for the future. “Had we dragged it out through the administration process, to go to effectively appeal, that could have taken months. “And then beyond that, the International Court of Appeal could have taken further months. “So, we could have been looking at a 12-month period to have this situation closed. “And the amount of speculation, commenting and sniping that has been going on in the paddock, we felt it’s in everybody’s interests – in our interests, in the FIA’s interests, in Formula 1’s interests, to say, ‘we close the book’.” M c Laren: Future penalties must be ‘much stronger’ than Red Bull’s Read more Horner said Red Bull accepts the penalties “begrudgingly, but we accept them”, claiming that part of the rationale was also that there is so much room for interpretation within brand-new regulations. “I think that there are lessons for everybody to learn and to work collectively,” said Horner. “Because I think the cost cap is an important part of Formula 1. It’s an important part of its future. But it has to be in a manner that is consistent and applicable and developed. “And with such a new concept of incredibly complex regulations around different entities, different subsidiary companies, companies that belong to OEMs, companies that are independent, companies that are a subsidiary of an energy drinks manufacturer. “Our structures, our cost base, our apportionment, it’s all different between all of those entities. “So that is why we’ve chosen to accept it. We take it on the chin. But now’s the time to put it to bed.” Horner was asked on Friday if, having been found guilty of breaking the rules, Red Bull should apologise for its actions. He said no and instead turned the focus on Red Bull’s rivals, who he has previously criticised for comments they started making weeks before Red Bull’s breach was official. “To be honest with you, I think we’re probably due an apology from some of our rivals for some of the claims that they’ve made,” said Horner. “We make no apologies for the way that we’ve performed, the way that we’ve acted. “We take it on the chin that there are lessons to be made and potentially mistakes have been made in our submission, which with the benefit of hindsight and 20-20 vision, everybody could be a specialist. What Red Bull aero testing penalty really is, and how it’ll hurt Read more “But there was no intent, there was nothing dishonest, and there was certainly no cheating involved, which has been alleged in certain corners. “I don’t feel that we need to apologise. I think that there are lessons that have been learned. Everybody can look forwards. “We’ve taken our pounding in public, we’ve taken a very public pounding with the accusations that have been made through other teams. “We’ve had our drivers booed at circuits. And the reputational damage made by allegations has been significant. “The time is now for that to stop, and to move on.”
Sainz leads Ferrari 1-2 as Verstappen spins in first practice, https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1015821/1/sainz-leads-ferrari-12-verstappen-spins-first-practice, The time for F1 cost cap talk was over for 60 minutes as the first session of running at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez got underway. The low grip track conditions caught out a number of drivers, including two-time world champion Verstappen. Verstappen was struggling with tyre grip in the middle part of the lap while running on the softs, losing control of his Red Bull and spinning at Turn 11. Verstappen could only manage the fourth-fastest time, slotting in behind Sainz, Charles Leclerc and Sergio Perez. Lewis Hamilton was one of the last drivers to set a lap on the softs, ending the session P5 overall., The time for F1 cost cap talk was over for 60 minutes as the first session of running at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez got underway. The low grip track conditions caught out a number of drivers, including two-time world champion Verstappen. Verstappen was struggling with tyre grip in the middle part of the lap while running on the softs, losing control of his Red Bull and spinning at Turn 11. He complained over team radio afterwards: "It's unbelievable. I couldn't correct it. So little grip." Verstappen could only manage the fourth-fastest time, slotting in behind Sainz, Charles Leclerc and Sergio Perez. It was tight at the top with just under 0.2s separating Sainz and Fernando Alonso in sixth. Lewis Hamilton was one of the last drivers to set a lap on the softs, ending the session P5 overall. Valtteri Bottas was just behind Alonso in seventh, while Lando Norris, Pierre Gasly and Sebastian Vettel rounded out the top 10. Daniel Ricciardo was 11th overall after spending much of the session in the garage with a brake issue. Next up was Zhou Guanyu, Lance Stroll, Mick Schumacher and Nicholas Latifi. Liam Lawson was 16th, replacing Yuki Tsunoda for this session. Lawson caused the second of two red flags, forcing the session to end early. Logan Sargeant (in for Alex Albon) was 17th overall ahead of Nyck de Vries (replacing George Russell). Jack Doohan’s session was cut short due to “anomalies in its PU data.” - ending the day 19th. Pietro Fittipaldi completed the order but a power unit issue halted his session early on.
FP1: Sainz leads Ferrari 1-2 as Mexico City weekend gets under way, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.fp1-sainz-leads-ferrari-1-2-as-mexico-city-weekend-gets-under-way.QkzKsbhR52XSzTx8O2TZ7.html, Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz set the early pace of the Mexico City Grand Prix weekend in FP1, leading team mate Charles Leclerc by 0.046s, ahead of the Red Bull pairing of Sergio Perez and Max Verstappen. Political noise dominated Friday morning in Mexico, as first Red Bull and then Aston Martin entered Agreements with the FIA over breaches of the 2021 Cost Cap. However, come 1300 local time, the principal noise reverberating around the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez was the sound of the V6 hybrid engines as Sebastian Vettel – bedecked in a tribute helmet to the late Red Bull co-owner Dietrich Mateschitz – led the drivers out on track. Fresh from their constructors’ triumph in Austin, Red Bull pair Verstappen and local hero Perez set the early benchmarks on the hard tyres – Verstappen three-tenths quicker than his team mate, backing up the notion that there would be no freebies for Perez this weekend in his pursuit of a maiden home win. Verstappen, meanwhile, would also suffer a bizarre spin on his soft-shod out-lap, perhaps caught out by the reduced air density at this track that sits 2,250m above sea level., Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz set the early pace of the Mexico City Grand Prix weekend in FP1, leading team mate Charles Leclerc by 0.046s, ahead of the Red Bull pairing of Sergio Perez and Max Verstappen.

READ MORE: Red Bull enter Agreement with FIA over breach of 2021 Financial Regulations Among those were a full five FP1 swap-ins: Pietro Fittipaldi replacing Kevin Magnussen at Haas, Logan Sargeant getting another run for Williams in place of Alex Albon, Jack Doohan making his FP1 debut for Alpine (Esteban Ocon moving aside), Liam Lawson taking Yuki Tsunoda’s AlphaTauri for a run, and Nyck de Vries – set to drive for AlphaTauri next year – in for George Russell at Mercedes. Fresh from their constructors’ triumph in Austin, Red Bull pair Verstappen and local hero Perez set the early benchmarks on the hard tyres – Verstappen three-tenths quicker than his team mate, backing up the notion that there would be no freebies for Perez this weekend in his pursuit of a maiden home win. However, when the soft tyres were bolted on, it was Ferrari who turned the tables on the Bulls, with Carlos Sainz stopping the clocks with a 1m 20.707s lap, narrowly ahead of Leclerc, with the Red Bull pair setting an identical time in P3 and P4, Perez ahead of Verstappen but both 0.120s behind Sainz. Verstappen, meanwhile, would also suffer a bizarre spin on his soft-shod out-lap, perhaps caught out by the reduced air density at this track that sits 2,250m above sea level.
Mexican GP: Sainz tops disrupted first F1 practice from Leclerc, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/mexican-gp-sainz-tops-first-f1-practice-from-leclerc/10391803/, As Leclerc lapped narrowly adrift, home hero Sergio Perez ran to third as Max Verstappen's progress was hurt by a rare spin for the newly crowned two-time world champion. He lit up the rears to recover from the tank slapper, having shaken his head and complaining of no grip. That left him 0.12s down on Leclerc but with an identical lap time to his teammate Perez. Sainz, therefore, could provisionally head the order for Ferrari as the Spaniard pounded round in 1m20.707s to sit pretty by 0.046s over his Monegasque teammate Leclerc. That meant Sainz set the pace by 0.046s over Leclerc as Perez and Verstappen wound up in third and fourth - 0.12s in arrears - while Lewis Hamilton led Mercedes in fifth place., Listen to this article A late failure for Liam Lawson - the F1 rookie replacing Yuki Tsunoda in the AlphaTauri - forced the session to be abandoned four minutes before time to leave Sainz to sit pretty in first. As Leclerc lapped narrowly adrift, home hero Sergio Perez ran to third as Max Verstappen's progress was hurt by a rare spin for the newly crowned two-time world champion. With the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez so dirty due to its lack of use and in view of an extended FP2 being dedicated to a 2023 Pirelli tyre test, the entire field soon emerged into the opening hour of running and all 20 drivers circulated with the hardest C2 white tyre. From the busy start, Verstappen ran fastest from the first five minutes as he toured round in 1m23.282s to sit six tenths faster than teammate Perez as Leclerc was forced back to the pits with a suspected left-rear puncture that benched him for 15 minutes. Verstappen would whittle away at his time to find another half second before Daniel Ricciardo came to split the Red Bulls and sit a little over a second adrift of the champion. But Ricciardo would then be forced for a spell on the sidelines while McLaren investigated a brake issue as Perez replaced his stablemate at the top courtesy of a 1m22.702s effort. Verstappen then nicked first place back by 0.411s as he ran to a 1m22.291s before most drivers darted for the pits after a quarter of an hour before bolting on a set of C4 softs. In a bid to make up for lost running, Leclerc headed out on the red-walled tyres somewhat early and became the first driver to lap in the 21s, running to a 1m21.546s to find 0.745s over Verstappen thanks to the quickest second and third sectors of anyone at the time. Verstappen's retaliation had to wait, though, due to a rare error for the Dutch racer, who could not catch a sliding rear to spin the Red Bull RB18 through the Turns 9-10 chicane. He lit up the rears to recover from the tank slapper, having shaken his head and complaining of no grip. He elected not to pit and posted a 1m20.827s that moved him to fourth place. That left him 0.12s down on Leclerc but with an identical lap time to his teammate Perez. Sainz, therefore, could provisionally head the order for Ferrari as the Spaniard pounded round in 1m20.707s to sit pretty by 0.046s over his Monegasque teammate Leclerc. The running was then interrupted by a red flag for the Haas of Pietro Fittipaldi - the Brazilian replacing Kevin Magnussen in the VF-22 - breaking down on the main straight after a puff of smoke from the engine eventually left him to park up out of the first corner. Another red flag might have been called moments earlier when Zhou Guanyu shut down his Alfa Romeo in the pitlane exit to prevent overheating after an upshift failure. But the marshals were soon enough able to push the stricken car behind the exit line to allow the Alfa mechanics to recover Zhou without the need for a session stoppage. However, the session was actually red-flagged for a second and final time with four minutes left on the clock when Lawson's car expired into Turn 13 with a sudden failure. As a result of his pulling over to deprive the AT03 of cool air, the brakes that the Kiwi had complained of throughout the session caught fire to leave FP1 to not be resumed. That meant Sainz set the pace by 0.046s over Leclerc as Perez and Verstappen wound up in third and fourth - 0.12s in arrears - while Lewis Hamilton led Mercedes in fifth place. US GP seventh-placed finisher Fernando Alonso clocked sixth ahead of Valtteri Bottas, while Lando Norris pipped Pierre Gasly and Sebastian Vettel's Aston Martin inside the top 10. Of the five substitute drivers, Lawson ran fastest despite his troubles in 16th, while 2023 Williams driver Logan Sargeant ran to 17th (two places behind Nicholas Latifi). AlphaTauri-bound Nyck de Vries was 18th as he replaced George Russell in the W13 - the Dutch driver notably thanking the team for his three years before his switch. Jack Doohan was hampered by a power unit issue to guide his Alpine to 19th ahead of Fittipaldi.
Aston Martin's Formula 1 Cost Cap Issues Were Due to Desks and Chairs, https://jalopnik.com/aston-martins-formula-1-cost-cap-issues-were-due-to-des-1849716453, This morning, the FIA finally announced penalties for Red Bull Racing after the team overspent Formula 1's cost cap in 2021.

It’ll have its wind tunnel and CFD hours reduced, but at the end of the day — but lost in the online discourse is the fact that Aston Martin also had cost cap filing errors, and possibly for the most hilarious reason in the world. It messed up filing expenditures for office furniture. This fun fact was brought to my attention by Jalopnik’s own Ryan King, who pointed out the concern via Twitter: Advertisement Whereas Red Bull was fined for a “minor overspend breach,” Aston Martin has sustained a $450,000 fine for a “procedural” breach. The FIA noted that Aston’s issues regarded the fact that the team “inaccurately excluded and/or adjusted costs in the calculation of its relevant costs.” As pointed out by the FIA, that included the “cost of desks and chairs,” along with catering services, unrecorded costs and losses regarding sponsor services, signing bonuses, and simulator fees. In essence, the FIA decided that the team just fumbled paperwork and didn’t intend to breach the cost cap in order to gain an advantage. The team did, after all, finish a meager seventh in the constructors’ standings and has only faced more difficulties this year. Inaccurately recording office furniture expenses probably didn’t make the team better or worse than the competition.

Wolff: Penalty "too little" for Mercedes "too much" for Red Bull, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/wolff-penalty-too-little-for-mercedes-too-much-for-red-bull/10391787/, Listen to this articleIt was announced today that Red Bull had signed an Accepted Breach Agreement with the governing body. "I think as for any penalty, for us, it's too little," Wolff told Motorsport.com. Regarding the Red Bull penalties, Wolff added: "I think any reduction in wind tunnel time is going to be detrimental. Toto Wolff, Team Principal and CEO, Mercedes AMG Photo by: Simon Galloway / Motorsport ImagesAsked for his thoughts on Christian Horner's explanation of why Red Bull was over the cap, Wolff said: "Nine teams complied with the regulations and stayed below the cap. Wolff praised FIA for overseeing the cost cap process and ensuring that Red Bull received a stiff penalty, suggesting that the outcome showed that "nothing was brushed under the carpet"., Listen to this article It was announced today that Red Bull had signed an Accepted Breach Agreement with the governing body. As a result, it has been docked 10% of its aero testing for 12 months from now and fined $7 million. "I think as for any penalty, for us, it's too little," Wolff told Motorsport.com. "For them, it will be too much." Regarding the Red Bull penalties, Wolff added: "I think any reduction in wind tunnel time is going to be detrimental. How detrimental is difficult to judge at this stage. "I think in absolute terms, $7m is a lot of money. But maybe in the bigger scheme of things for Red Bull, considering the investment they do on the power unit side and on the team, it's not." Wolff agreed that today's outcome will serve as a suitable deterrent for other teams, and help to ensure that the cost cap will be respected in future. "I think that the sum of the penalties is a deterrent, the sporting penalty, and to a lesser degree, the financial fine. "But reputational damage that is happening is probably the biggest thing, and no team will want to come anywhere near that, because obviously, we are living in a transparent and compliant world. "Our shareholders or our partners demand compliance, and in that respect that's just not on anymore." Toto Wolff, Team Principal and CEO, Mercedes AMG Photo by: Simon Galloway / Motorsport Images Asked for his thoughts on Christian Horner's explanation of why Red Bull was over the cap, Wolff said: "Nine teams complied with the regulations and stayed below the cap. This is a sport of marginal gains, and everything else is just chatter. There's no mitigating factor." Wolff praised FIA for overseeing the cost cap process and ensuring that Red Bull received a stiff penalty, suggesting that the outcome showed that "nothing was brushed under the carpet". "What I take as a positive is the strong governance," he added. "Nothing was brushed under the carpet. The FIA stood by the process. And I think that although the administration has only been in place for 10 months, it's very encouraging to see things executed. "That's the really positive of the process. Mohammed [Ben Sulayem], with a strong group of individuals, Federico [Lodi, head of financial regs], Shaila Ann [Rao, interim secretary general for sport] and Nikolas [Tombazis, single-seater technical head], ensured that the assessment and the policing of the cost cap was robust. And that is what I take as a positive out of the whole process. "What we need to tidy up is the minor and major breaches. I think a breach is a breach. And that's how it should be handled."

Red Bull accepted FIA cost cap breach agreement for good of F1 says Horner, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/red-bull-accepted-fia-cost-cap-breach-agreement-for-good-of-f1-says-horner/10391775/, Listen to this articleThe FIA announced on Friday in Mexico that Red Bull had entered an Accepted Breach Agreement after it was found to have exceeded the $145 million budget cap in 2021. But he said that Red Bull ultimately felt it was in the best interests of F1 as a whole to draw a line under the case and accept the FIA's proposal. Christian Horner, Team Principal, Red Bull Racing, in a press conference regarding the recent findings of the cost cap breach. "The cost cap is an important part of Formula 1. It's important that the cost cap is an important part of Formula 1's success in the future., Listen to this article The FIA announced on Friday in Mexico that Red Bull had entered an Accepted Breach Agreement after it was found to have exceeded the $145 million budget cap in 2021. Red Bull was handed a $7m fine and a 10% hit on its aerodynamic testing allowance for the next 12 months, a sanction that team principal Horner called "enormous" and "draconian." Had Red Bull not accepted the proposal made by the FIA, the case would have been referred to F1's Cost Cap Adjudication Panel, and could potentially have gone as far as the FIA's International Court of Appeal if the team looked to fight it. During a press conference on Friday in Mexico, Horner explained how a different interpretation for areas such as tax exclusions, the status of spare parts, catering costs, sick pay and redundancies had caused the £1.8m breach - £1.4m of which could have covered by tax that was not excluded. But he said that Red Bull ultimately felt it was in the best interests of F1 as a whole to draw a line under the case and accept the FIA's proposal. "Had we dragged it out through the administration process, to go to effectively appeal, that could have taken months," said Horner. "Beyond that, the International Court of Appeal could have taken further months. So we could have been looking at a 12-month period to have this situation closed. "The amount of speculation and commenting and sniping that has been going on in the paddock, we felt it was in everybody's interests, in our interests and the FIA's interests, in Formula 1's interests, to say we close the book. We close the book here and today. "We accept the penalties begrudgingly, but we accept them." Christian Horner, Team Principal, Red Bull Racing, in a press conference regarding the recent findings of the cost cap breach. The FIA have handed Red Bull a $7m fine and an aero testing reduction Photo by: Carl Bingham / Motorsport Images Horner noted the immaturity of the financial regulations, given they were only introduced in 2021 and this was the first year that a full audit was completed, and called for lessons to be learned given the complexity of each team's structure and business. "The cost cap is an important part of Formula 1. It's an important part of its future, but it has to be in a manner that is consistent and applicable and developed," said Horner. "With such a new concept of incredibly complex regulations, around different entities, different subsidiary companies, companies that belong to OEMs, companies that are independent, companies that are a subsidiary of an energy drinks manufacturer." The impact on aerodynamic development and wind tunnel time is set to hurt Red Bull as it looks to defend its F1 titles next year, as well as reaching to its 2024 car given the length of the sanction. But Horner said that fighting the case further could have opened the team up to even harsher penalties outside of the ABA's allowances. "Within a new set of regulations like this, and the suite of penalties that they have available within that panel could be even more draconian," he said. "So whilst we feel hard done by, we feel that there were absolutely mitigating circumstances in this. To drag that process out, we didn't feel was in anybody's interest. "I think it's been a huge learning experience for us. I'm sure others have learned watching from the sidelines. It's important that the cost cap is an important part of Formula 1's success in the future. "But it needs to be applied in the right way. To potentially go down that path as well would have not been the right thing to do."

The FIA noted in its report that Red Bull acted in "good faith", listing a number of areas that the team interpreted incorrectly and led to its breach. Horner held a press conference on Friday in Mexico to discuss the matter, during which he outlined how Red Bull had exceeded the budget cap and why the team accepted the FIA's offer.

Red Bull was slapped with a $7m fine for the breach, which was found to have been £1.8m, as well as a 10% reduction in its aerodynamic testing allowance for the next 12 months. The FIA noted in its report that Red Bull acted in "good faith", listing a number of areas that the team interpreted incorrectly and led to its breach. Horner held a press conference on Friday in Mexico to discuss the matter, during which he outlined how Red Bull had exceeded the budget cap and why the team accepted the FIA's offer. But Horner hit out at the penalty that had been handed down to Red Bull, believing it had been lobbied for by many of its direct rivals. Horner called the $7m fine "an enormous amount of money", but felt the limit on aerodynamic testing and development for next year was "the more draconian part" of the sanction. "I've heard people reporting today that's an insignificant amount," said Horner. "I can tell you now, that is an enormous amount. That represents anywhere between a quarter and half a second's worth of laptime. That comes in from now, that has a direct effect on next year's car, and will be in place for a 12-month period. "By winning the constructors' championship, we become victims of our own success, in addition to that 10%, having 5% incremental disadvantage or handicap compared to the second and third place.

Horner felt the 12-month period of the sanction would impact both the 2023 and the 2024 car, and believed its severity was pushed for by the team's rivals. "It gives an advantage to our competitors, which is why they were pushing so hard for a draconian penalty," said Horner. "We're going to have to work incredibly hard in the time that we have available, and we're going to have to be efficient with our time, we're going to have to be efficient with the runs that we choose to do in our wind tunnel. "I have full belief in our team, in the capability of our team. I think they've demonstrated that time and time again. "There were other sporting penalties that were available to the FIA. But this one was obviously lobbied hard for by our competitors because they felt it hit us the hardest." Horner added: "I'm sure if you burned our wind tunnel down, it wouldn't be enough."
Red Bull thinks breach punishment could make it 0.5s slower, https://the-race.com/formula-1/red-bull-thinks-breach-punishment-will-cost-it-half-a-second/, Red Bull Formula 1 team boss Christian Horner has provided an estimate of the laptime his team will lose as a result of the sporting penalty it’s agreed to for its overspend in 2021.

Addressing the media in Mexico after the news of the ABA, Horner corroborated reporting that he had been informed by the FIA that it was declaring Red Bull to be in breach just over an hour after Verstappen’s second coronation, at Suzuka. Red Bull, however, clearly has a different view of the situation.

Red Bull was officially declared to be in minor breach of the newly-introduced cost cap for last season – in which it won the drivers’ title with Max Verstappen – earlier this month, before entering into a so-called ‘Accepted Breach Agreement’ with F1’s governing body the FIA in the lead-up to this weekend’s Mexican Grand Prix.

Addressing the media in Mexico after the news of the ABA, Horner corroborated reporting that he had been informed by the FIA that it was declaring Red Bull to be in breach just over an hour after Verstappen’s second coronation, at Suzuka. He indicated the team had swiftly accepted the FIA’s proposal to work out an ABA – with the alternative option having been to take the case before the cost cap adjudication panel – and that it has been a back-and-forth process since. It has been suggested by rival teams that Red Bull’s overspend would’ve equated to a laptime gain in the range from a tenth to a quarter of a second for 2021, and that at least a 20% ATR reduction would be required to offset this. Red Bull, however, clearly has a different view of the situation. “We’ve been provided a significant penalty, both financially and sportingly, from the seven million dollars – which is an enormous amount of money, that is payable within a 30-day period – and obviously the more draconian part is the sporting penalty, which is a 10% reduction in our ability to utilise our windtunnel and aerodynamic tools,” Horner said. “And that, I’ve heard people reporting today [that it] is an insignificant amount – let me tell you now, that is an enormous amount. “That represents anywhere between quarter and half a second worth of laptime.” How F1 rivals might view the size of Red Bull’s penalty Read more He explained that the impact would be particularly strong because F1 is only one year into its new aerodynamic regulations, so the potential gains from testing and development are bigger at present. “We cannot do as many windtunnel runs, we cannot run as many simulations,” Horner added. “That will have a material effect on our performance. “It is difficult to put a laptime figure but one assumes that while these regulations are still pretty mature and development is still steep.” The ATR limit kicks in right away – which, as per Horner, means it will “have a direct effect on next year’s car” – and will be in place for the next 12 months. And it goes on top of the restrictions Red Bull already faces as 2022’s top-performing team. “By winning the constructors’ championship, obviously we’ve become victims of our own success by in addition to that 10% having 5% incremental disadvantage, handicap, compared to the second and third place. “So, just for clarity, we will have 15% less windtunnel time than the second-placed team in the constructors’ championship, and 20% [actually 21%] less than the third place. “Again, a draconian amount. So that 10%, put into reality, as I say, will have an impact on our ability to perform on track next year.”
Emerson Fittipaldi slams 'talentless' F1 drivers and makes Mick Schumacher claim, https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/emerson-fittipaldi-mick-schumacher-haas-28354664, For example, three of the last four F2 champions have failed to find a seat after their title-winning seasons, the exception being Mick Schumacher after his 2020 success. And it was while commenting on the German's current situation that Fittipaldi claimed there are still too many pay drivers in the sport. "Unfortunately, in racing today all the way from karting, Formula 4, Formula 3, and Formula 2, money makes the difference. And then you have a possible driver, like Mick Schumacher, who has good talent, is dedicated, and makes a good effort to be in Formula 1. However, it is not believed that the Brazilian is in the running for the 2023 race seat if the team does decide to replace Schumacher with another racer., Despite measures in place to reduce the number of pay drivers in F1, former champion Fittipaldi still believes there are too many who have more cash than talent Two-time Formula 1 world champion Emerson Fittipaldi called for teams and the FIA to work together to make sure talent is a more important factor than money when it comes to securing a seat in the sport. Pay drivers have long been a part of F1. Through the decades there have been scores of racers with a lot of talent, but who have not been given a shot in the series because of other, less capable racers who were able to pay to land a seat. Measures such as the FIA's superlicence system have been taken to reduce this, but it still happens. For example, three of the last four F2 champions have failed to find a seat after their title-winning seasons, the exception being Mick Schumacher after his 2020 success. And it was while commenting on the German's current situation that Fittipaldi claimed there are still too many pay drivers in the sport. Schumacher is in danger of losing his seat next season as Haas consider their options, and the Brazilian believes this is a sign that the team may be hoping to sign someone with cash to burn. "I think Mick this year has done a very good job. He improved a lot – I cannot judge," Fittipaldi told VegasInsider. "Unfortunately, in racing today all the way from karting, Formula 4, Formula 3, and Formula 2, money makes the difference. "We have a tremendous wave of kids with a lot of money and sponsors who come to racing and want to be an F1 driver, but sometimes the talent is not good. And then you have a possible driver, like Mick Schumacher, who has good talent, is dedicated, and makes a good effort to be in Formula 1. Image: REUTERS) REUTERS) "If the team made that comment that he is too expensive for the team [because of his costly crashes this season] that means the team needs someone with money. That is something we have to change for the future. We need more talent and less money in racing. "That's the vision I have for the future. Unfortunately, we all have to work together to achieve that. The FIA, Formula 1, the teams, and the sponsors have to make that change for the future. It has to be a global mutual effort to change that for the future. I hope we can make it work." Fittipaldi's grandson Pietro is a reserve driver for Haas. However, it is not believed that the Brazilian is in the running for the 2023 race seat if the team does decide to replace Schumacher with another racer.
Is Red Bull's F1 cost cap penalty adequate? Our verdict, https://the-race.com/formula-1/is-red-bulls-f1-cost-cap-penalty-adequate-our-verdict/, We finally know the full details of Red Bull’s 2021 Formula 1 cost cap overspend and what the punishment will be. This now sets a precedent for how any cost cap irregularities will be handled in the future and it’s not a good precedent. Protecting the cost cap was what matteredEdd StrawWhile the penalties for the cost cap breach are a little gentle, right from the start of this controversy the priority has always been that whatever the outcome, the cost cap regulations and protocols are shored up. What Red Bull aero testing penalty really is, and how it’ll hurt Read moreWhat matters most, though, is what impact this penalty will have. Red Bull went over the cost cap essentially by a few hundred thousand pounds and will take a 10% hit on aero testing time., We finally know the full details of Red Bull’s 2021 Formula 1 cost cap overspend and what the punishment will be. Is the $7million fine and 10% reduction in aerodynamic testing time for next year fair or excessive? Will this draw a satisfactory line under this latest 2021 controversy? Here are our writers’ initial thoughts: A bad precedent has been set Gary Anderson From my point of view I’m just glad it’s all over, now we can get through these last few races and let the racing grab the headlines. The $7m fine doesn’t come out of next year’s budget cap so in reality if you have the money it’s no problem. Even finishing one position better in the constructors’ championship will pay more than that. As for the 10% deducted from Red Bull’s aerodynamic research time, it just means Adrian Newey and his colleagues will have to scratch their heads that little bit more. This now sets a precedent for how any cost cap irregularities will be handled in the future and it’s not a good precedent. I’m not saying the FIA should have taken away points but the fine should have come out of the following year’s cost cap limit and the aerodynamic research time losses should have been more draconian. If you are going to have a cost cap regulation then it needs to be implemented and executed in such a manner that it removes the temptation to overspend. Protecting the cost cap was what mattered Edd Straw While the penalties for the cost cap breach are a little gentle, right from the start of this controversy the priority has always been that whatever the outcome, the cost cap regulations and protocols are shored up. The summary of the Accepted Breach Agreement runs through an extensive list of areas where the Cost Cap Administration disagreed with Red Bull’s ways of applying the rules when it came to calculating its spending figures under the cost cap. Many will focus on the fact this shows there were plenty of areas where Red Bull breached the rules, but every one of the 13 areas also represents an aspect of the regulations effectively clarified. Why F1’s divisive ‘necessary curveball’ is worth fighting for Read more This is what matters most. This is the first significant test case for the cost cap regulations and the response was always going to be make or break for them. By using this Red Bull breach to create clear examples of how the cost cap regulations can and cannot be applied, it should create a line in the sand. Rivals will be frustrated at the relative leniency of the penalty and doubtless will complain, but the absolute priority always had to be shoring up the cost cap for the long haul. Provided this process has indeed been used to demonstrate exactly where the line is in applying the financial regulations, it will mean that next time there’s an infringement, the penalties can be draconian. Sometimes, the big picture is what matters most and if that has been served, then it will be for the long-term good of F1. Seems like a needless misunderstanding Ben Anderson It’s interesting that the FIA’s report states that had Red Bull had got its tax affairs properly in order, the Cost Cap Administration would have classified Red Bull’s overspend at £1.4million less than it ultimately did. “The FIA acknowledges that had RBR applied the correct treatment within its Full Year Reporting Documentation of RBR’s Notional Tax Credit within its 2021 submission of a value of £1,431,348, it would have been considered by the Cost Cap Administration to be in compliance with Article 4.1(b) of the Regulations and therefore RBR’s Relevant Costs for the 2021 Reporting Period would have in fact exceeded the 2021 Cost Cap by £432,652”. Red Bull doesn’t actually need to breach F1’s cost cap to win Read more So the FIA is basically saying it was within Red Bull’s gift to turn a £1,864,000 breach into one that was ‘merely’ £432,652 without having had to spend less on its cars/people/food or whatever – so having slightly different accounting processes could presumably make all the difference in future. But even £432,652 is £432,652 too much. Red Bull overspent in 2021 whichever way you look at it – even if it later argues that money was being spent on something immaterial to the car/team’s performance last year. Red Bull thus has to accept it broke the rules and must be punished. A $7m fine is small change to a team like Red Bull, so the only thing that really matters is that its windtunnel and CFD time will be further restricted next year – on top of what already applies under F1’s new balance of performance rules in this area. This will no doubt hurt – but when you already have the best car on the grid by a decent margin, will it really hurt all that much? And how significant is all this in the grand scheme of things if, in an alternate reality, Red Bull could account slightly differently, find an additional £500,000 savings from somewhere (surely doable), and avoid this whole sorry mess in the first place? Feels like a needless misunderstanding to me. But breaking the rules by mistake is still breaking the rules, and hopefully the extra aerodynamic testing restrictions will cause enough pain to deter teams from trying to run too close to the cost-cap’s margins. This penalty will hurt Scott Mitchell-Malm Red Bull’s breach has been confirmed, the exact number publicly stated (£1.8m) and an interesting step from the FIA in that it felt the need to point out that an incorrectly accounted tax credit would have slashed the breach to around £400k. These numbers are in line with expectations, and while Red Bull will argue that the money didn’t come out of its development pot, rivals and critics will say that it’s all one pot – so there will be an advantage somewhere. What Red Bull aero testing penalty really is, and how it’ll hurt Read more What matters most, though, is what impact this penalty will have. It was always the number one priority for F1’s budget cap to be reinforced. The penalty had to be enough to deter anyone from an overspend. Now, obviously some will say that a fine and 10% of your windtunnel time is a price worth paying for a world championship. But that is quite a big oversimplification. Focusing on what Red Bull has lost, the drop in windtunnel and CFD work is more than the gap between championship positions. That will be felt at the end of this year all the way through to the end of October in 2023. And the 2023 and 2024 cars will be impacted by this. Clearly, it’s lenient enough that Red Bull can work to offset the loss. Maybe it can mitigate it entirely, and still have a title-winning car in 2023 and 2024. But the penalty will not be easily shrugged off and it would be a surprise if there is no performance hit as a result of it. Whether Red Bull’s rivals feel the same is another matter. There are advantages to be gained from breaching the budget cap, deliberately or not. Now everyone has an idea of what punishment awaits, the question is simple: will anyone think this kind of penalty is worth the risk? This has taken far too long Mark Hughes Thank God this is done and we can get back to racing. Red Bull went over the cost cap essentially by a few hundred thousand pounds and will take a 10% hit on aero testing time. It’s not as big a breach as was feared, but an important point is that it has taken this long to resolve something which relates to the 2021 season. If, as feared, developing the new cars if 2022 has proven more expensive and anyone has breached the ’22 cost cap, there really needs to be a system for a faster resolution than this. Rivals can’t complain too much Valentin Khorounzhiy Even though today marks the joyful occasion of F1’s interminable, increasingly insufferable-in-hindsight 2021 season finally being over (or is it?), it is easy to sympathise with those fans who will feel Red Bull got away lightly for not just bending but breaking the rules. Other F1 teams though? No sympathy there. This is the version of the F1 regulations they helped hash out in the F1 Commission meetings, with the major/minor breaches and the accepted breach agreement mechanism. Ferrari and Mercedes: ‘Minor’ cap breach can have huge impact Read more And they will know the borders of the cost cap are ultimately nebulous, just as much part of ‘the game’ as the tech trickery. They will know that because earlier this year they voted to have those borders shifted mid-season. Should F1 have fixed penalties for cost cap breaches? Maybe. Probably. The argument goes that the FIA and F1 thought a certain vagueness would mean the fear of unknown penalties being huge ones would act as a deterrent. But you have to imagine the teams would’ve liked that vagueness too – a margin for error that protects an outfit from being automatically thrown out for going half a million over. So if Red Bull’s rivals don’t like what they’ve seen today, it’s not the ABA terms but the rules they need to be looking at. How will the fine be spent? Jack Benyon My Formula 1 colleagues are far better placed to debate the fine details of today’s news. The question I have is: where does the money go? The Red Bull and Aston Martin fines combined don’t reach anywhere near the $100m McLaren was hit with in 2007 for the spying debacle, but over $7m is still a huge amount of money to just be handed over to the FIA. The likelihood is the money will be donated to the FIA Foundation, its charitable arm, and redirected. I hope that redirection is to a good cause and that the FIA publicises where the money has gone and how it has been used. The F1 teams have to detail their spending under the cost cap rules, and the FIA should do the same with the money it gleans from fines from it.

From each million dollars being worth around 0.1s of lap time (so 0.24s in this case) with a reduction in aero sim of around 20% needed to achieve a balancing 0.24s penalty going forwards. To the $2.4m overspend being worth only around 0.1s – but requiring a much bigger restriction in tunnel time/CFD capacity to achieve this because of the highly prescriptive nature of the current aero regs.

Red Bull hit with $7m fine and aero testing cut after F1 cost cap breach — but no points deduction, https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/articles/single-seaters/f1/red-bull-hit-with-7m-fine-and-reduced-aero-testing-after-cost-cap-breach-but-no-points-deduction, Last year was the first in which the cost cap applied, as one of the measures introduced to make F1 more affordable and competitive. When these were added to last year’s spending, Red Bull’s budget exceeded the cap. If this had been correctly reported, Red Bull’s breach would have been substantially lower. Red Bull’s penalties for breaching the F1 cost capRed Bull must now pay its $7m fine within 30 days of October 26, when the ABA was agreed. The money does not come out of this year’s cost cap allowance., However, it is likely to fuel further controversy over the result of last year’s F1 drivers’ championship, decided at the contentious Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, which saw Max Verstappen taking the lead — and the drivers’ title — from Lewis Hamilton on the final lap, after an unprecedented early end to a safety car period. Hamilton has already said that he could have been champion if Mercedes had been able to spend £300,000 more in developing the 2021 car. Last year was the first in which the cost cap applied, as one of the measures introduced to make F1 more affordable and competitive. The FIA announced the penalties in a document that states the overspend resulted from a procedural error in which costs totalling £5,607,000 in total were not accurately accounted for. When these were added to last year’s spending, Red Bull’s budget exceeded the cap. However, the team also inaccurately applied a “notional tax credit”. If this had been correctly reported, Red Bull’s breach would have been substantially lower. There is little further detail on this, but it may refer to a government scheme that allows companies to claim tax relief on certain research and development costs. The FIA said: “Had Red Bull applied the correct treatment…it would have been considered by the cost cap administration to be in compliance with Article 4.1(b) of the regulations and therefore RBR’s relevant costs for the 2021 reporting period would have in fact exceeded the 2021 cost cap by £432,652 (0.37%).” How Red Bull overspent the cost cap Most of the inaccuracies in Red Bull’s accounts were linked to administrative functions. They included: •Catering services • Employer’s social security considerations • Costs in respect of non-F1 activities • Costs related to disposal of assets • Apprenticeship levies • The cost of using power units • Costs charged by Red Bull Powertrains to the team • Travel costs By agreeing an ABA, Red Bull ensured that it would not receive a points deduction for the 2021 season, which could have affected the championship results, as the sanction cannot be applied as part of a negotiated penalty. Red Bull’s penalties for breaching the F1 cost cap Red Bull must now pay its $7m fine within 30 days of October 26, when the ABA was agreed. The money does not come out of this year’s cost cap allowance. The aerodynamic testing reduction comes into play immediately, for a period of 12 months from October 26. It is likely to have a severe impact on Red Bull, which already has the lowest wind tunnel and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) testing allowance of all teams on the grid, by dint of its position at the top of the championship. The allowances are recalculated twice a year, at which time the team that’s top of the constructors’ table is allowed 70% of a baseline limit, which increases by 5% for each position down the table. Until October 26, Red Bull had the 70% allowance. Ferrari has 75% of the baseline and Mercedes 80%, down to Williams, which has 115%. “Red Bull has acted co-operatively and that there is no accusation that it has sought to act dishonestly” Since the ABA was agreed, the 10% penalty has reduced Red Bull’s allowance to 63% of the baseline — 12% less than Ferrari. With the 2023 baseline set at the equivalent of 160 wind tunnel runs and 1000 CFD simulations per month, Red Bull will have 101 wind tunnel runs and 630 CFD simulations a month in the first part of next year, compared with 120 runs and 750 simulations for Ferrari (assuming it remains second in the championship). Red Bull will also have to meet the costs of the ABA procedure. “Following the submission of all required documentation by all ten Formula 1 teams, the cost cap administration carried out the first ever review process under the Formula 1 world championship financial regulations,” the FIA said in what read as an almost conciliatory statement. “These new financial regulations are a very complex set of rules that competitors were required to adapt to for the first time.” “Red Bull Racing was found to be in breach, however, the cost cap administration recognised that Red Bull Racing has acted co-operatively throughout the review process and has sought to provide additional information and evidence when requested in a timely manner, that this is the first year of the full application of the financial regulations and that there is no accusation or evidence that RBR has sought at any time to act in bad faith, dishonestly or in fraudulent manner, nor has it wilfully concealed any information from the cost cap administration.”

In addition to the $450,000 fine, Aston Martin must bear the costs incurred by the Cost Cap Administration in connection with the preparation of the ABA. Aston Martin accepted the breach and has stated for some time now that it regretted the offence, which it put down to the complexity of the new financial regulations. The FIA stated: “The Cost Cap Administration recognised that AMR has acted cooperatively and in good faith throughout the review process and has sought to provide additional information and evidence when requested in a timely manner, that this is the first year of the full application of the Financial Regulations and that there is no accusation or evidence that AMR has sought or obtained any undue advantage as a result of the breach.”

Cost pursuant to Article 3.1(h)(i) of the Financial Regulations (concerning costs in respect of the new F1 Team headquarters);2. Costs pursuant to Article 3.1(h)(i) of the Financial Regulations (concerning cost in respect of the new F1 simulator);4. Cost pursuant to Article 3.1(i) of the Financial Regulations (concerning cost of catering services provided to personnel at its factory headquarters);10. Cost pursuant to Article 3.1(i) of the Financial Regulations (concerning cost of desks and chairs);11., Listen to this article Here is the FIA’s report in full: An Accepted Breach Agreement (“ABA”) dated 25 October 2022 has been entered into by the Cost Cap Administration and AMR GP Limited (“AMR”) pursuant to Article 6.28 of the FIA Formula 1 Financial Regulations (“Financial Regulations”). The Financial Regulations are issued by the FIA and form part of the terms and conditions of participation in the FIA Formula One World Championship. The Cost Cap Administration recognised that: (a) notwithstanding the CCA’s determination of Procedural Breach, AMR’s Relevant Costs during the 2021 reporting period were below the 2021 Cost Cap; (b) AMR has acted cooperatively throughout the review process and has sought to provide additional information and evidence when requested in a timely manner; (c), that this is the first year of the full application of the Financial Regulations which are a very complex set of rules that competitors were required to adapt to; (d) that there is no accusation or evidence that AMR has sought at any time to act in bad faith, dishonesty or in a fraudulent manner; (e)nor has it wilfully concealed any information from the Cost Cap Administration and (f) that AMR did not gain or seek to gain any advantage from the inaccurate exclusions or adjustments of certain costs. The Cost Cap Administration considered it appropriate, in these circumstances, to offer to AMR an ABA to resolve this matter on the terms set out below, given the limited nature of the breach in issue, and AMR’s willingness to accept the breach and to cooperate with the Cost Cap Administration. That offer was accepted by AMR. The ABA concerns: • A Procedural Breach committed by AMR pursuant to Article 8.2(e) of the Financial Regulations due to its failure to file accurate Full Year Reporting Documentation in respect of the 2021 Full Year Reporting Period because it inaccurately excluded and/or adjusted costs in the calculation of its Relevant Costs. Summary of ABA terms and sanctions In accordance with the findings of the Cost Cap Administration, AMR has acknowledged that the Reporting Documentation submitted by it included the following incorrectly excluded and/or adjusted costs: 1.

Understatement of Relevant Costs in respect of the provision set forth by Article 4.1(b)(ii) (concerning R&D tax credit); 3. Costs pursuant to Article 3.1(h)(i) of the Financial Regulations (concerning cost in respect of the new F1 simulator); 4. Cost pursuant to Article 3.1(o) of the Financial Regulations (concerning wind tunnel additional fees); 5. Cost pursuant to Article 3.1(i) of the Financial Regulations (concerning certain signing bonus cost); 6. Understatement of Relevant Costs in respect of provisions set forth by Article 4.1(a)(ii) of the Financial Regulations (concerning the use of Transferable Components); 7.

On that basis, AMR has accepted the imposition of the following sanctions in full and final settlement of the Procedural Breach: a) AMR must pay a Financial Penalty of USD 450,000 to the FIA within 30 days of the date of execution of the ABA (Article 9.5 of the Financial Regulations); b) AMR bears the costs incurred by the Cost Cap Administration in connection with the preparation of the ABA. The decision of the Cost Cap Administration to enter into the ABA constitutes its final decision resolving this matter and is not subject to appeal. Non-compliance by AMR with any terms of the ABA will result in a further Procedural Breach under Articles 6.30 and 8.2(f) of the Financial Regulations and automatic referral to the Cost Cap Adjudication Panel.
Red Bull F1 cost cap penalty: The 13 errors listed by the FIA, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/red-bull-f1-cost-cap-penalty-the-13-errors-listed-by-the-fia/10391646/, The FIA has only made public the basic information in terms of which elements of the financial regulations were involved, but some information has emerged in recent weeks, and the public should learn more from Christian Horner later today. Introducing the list, the FIA notes that "in accordance with the findings of the cost cap administration, Red Bull has acknowledged that the reporting documentation submitted by it included the following incorrectly". Costs pursuant to Article 3.1(h)(i) of the Financial Regulations (in respect of Non-F1 Activities), as those costs had already been offset within Total Costs of the Reporting Group. Costs pursuant to Article 3.1(q) of the Financial Regulations (concerning apprenticeship levies)This rule relates to the exclusion of social security contributions and in this case apparently involved apprentices working at Red Bull. Clerical error in respect of RBR's calculation of certain costs re-charged to it by Red Bull Power Trains Limited., Listen to this article The governing body reports that the team "inaccurately excluded and/or adjusted costs amounting to a total of £5,607,000" in the submission it made in March last year and that in the final analysis, it overspent by £1,864,000. So where did the team get it wrong? The FIA has only made public the basic information in terms of which elements of the financial regulations were involved, but some information has emerged in recent weeks, and the public should learn more from Christian Horner later today. Introducing the list, the FIA notes that "in accordance with the findings of the cost cap administration, Red Bull has acknowledged that the reporting documentation submitted by it included the following incorrectly". So here is a closer look at what regulations are concerned: 1. Overstated excluded costs pursuant to Article 3.1(a) of the Financial Regulations (concerning catering services) This is related to catering costs at the factory, and the inability to separate costs of feeding employees who don't come under the cap, such as admin and marketing, and those who do. The FIA insisted on including the total catering costs. 2. Costs pursuant to Article 3.1(w) of the Financial Regulations concerning consideration and associated employer's social security contributions) This relates to excluding the costs of an "employee that has been formally placed on indefinite sick leave or disability leave". It's understood there was a disagreement relating to costs connected to a senior employee who was both ill and at the same time involved in a redundancy process. 3. Costs pursuant to Article 3.1(h)(i) of the Financial Regulations (in respect of Non-F1 Activities), as those costs had already been offset within Total Costs of the Reporting Group. This rule outlines the exclusions of "all costs directly attributable to non-F1 activities". 4. Costs pursuant to Article 3.1(k) of the Financial Regulations (in respect of bonus and associated employer's social security contributions) This rule relates to the exclusion of employee bonuses, which RBR staff would have received after Max Verstappen's title success. 5. Understatement of Relevant Costs in respect of a gain on disposal of fixed assets by failing to make the necessary upwards adjustment. The FIA has given no information on what assets were sold. 6. Costs pursuant to Article 3.1(q) of the Financial Regulations (concerning apprenticeship levies) This rule relates to the exclusion of social security contributions and in this case apparently involved apprentices working at Red Bull. 7. Costs pursuant to Article 3.1(h)(ii)(i) of the Financial Regulations (concerning consideration and associated employer's social security contributions) This rule relates to exclusion of "social security contributions incurred in respect of any personnel engaged in both F1 activities and non-F1 activities". 8. Understatement of Relevant Costs in respect of provisions set forth by Article 4.1(a)(i) of the Financial Regulations (concerning the cost of use of Power Units) This rule states that any "power unit transaction in connection with an F1 activity must be included in relevant Costs at not less than fair value." In 2021 Red Bull was supplied with free works power units by Honda. 9. Costs pursuant to Article 3.1(h) (i) of the Financial Regulations (concerning consideration and associated employer's social security contributions) As with item 3, this relates to excluding costs directly attributable to non-F1 activities. 10. Understatement of Relevant Costs in respect of provisions set forth by Article 4.1(f)(i)(B) of the Financial Regulations (concerning use of inventories) This relates to allocating the costs of unused spare parts to the heritage department and thus taking them out of the cap. It is believed to be the single biggest item in this list, with Horner suggesting in Austin involves a seven-figure sum. 11. Clerical error in respect of RBR's calculation of certain costs re-charged to it by Red Bull Power Trains Limited. This relates to the sister Powertrains division that was being set up during 2021. 12. Certain travel costs pursuant to Article 3.1(r) of the Financial Regulations This rule relates to the exclusion of all flight and hotel costs in connection with a competition or testing of current cars by personnel. 13. Costs of maintenance pursuant to Article 3.1(i) of the Financial Regulations This relates to the exclusion of "all costs directly attributable to human resources activities, finance activities or legal activities.
What Red Bull aero testing penalty really is and how it'll hurt, https://the-race.com/formula-1/what-red-bull-aero-testing-penalty-really-is-and-how-itll-hurt/, F1 introduced a handicap system that means successful teams have less windtunnel and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) testing. The numbers are based on a limit for windtunnel and CFD work for what is called an ‘Aerodynamic Testing Period’. This would be 16 windtunnel runs fewer than nearest rival Ferrari and 32 fewer runs than Mercedes. So, instead of 70%, Red Bull will have 63%. Of note is the fact that Red Bull’s limitation is valid for a period of 12 months from the date of execution of the Accepted Breach Agreement., Red Bull’s budget cap breach has cost it a reduction in its aerodynamic testing allowance that is broadly the equivalent of an extra 1.5 places in Formula 1’s constructors’ championship. F1 introduced a handicap system that means successful teams have less windtunnel and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) testing. It was applied for the first time in 2021 with 2.5% increments between the positions, but this increased to 5% in 2022. From this season onwards the team finishing last gets 115% of a baseline allowance, dropping to only 70% for the winning constructor. The numbers are based on a limit for windtunnel and CFD work for what is called an ‘Aerodynamic Testing Period’. There are six of these in a year, mostly lasting 8 weeks. Based on the normal allowances, Red Bull would be entitled to 70% of the baseline limit for 2023, which would equate to 224 windtunnel runs and 1400 CFD items per ATP. This would be 16 windtunnel runs fewer than nearest rival Ferrari and 32 fewer runs than Mercedes. In CFD terms it would mean 100 items versus Ferrari and 200 compared to Mercedes. What Red Bull would have had Per ‘Aerodynamic Testing Period’ of ~8 weeks As-it-stands 2022 position Team % of aero testing limit # of windtunnel runs # of CFD items 1 Red Bull 70 224 1400 2 Ferrari 75 240 1500 3 Mercedes 80 256 1600 4 Alpine 85 272 1700 5 McLaren 90 288 1800 6 Alfa Romeo 95 304 1900 7 Aston Martin 100 320 2000 8 Haas 105 336 2100 9 AlphaTauri 110 352 2200 10 Williams 115 368 2300 But Red Bull’s penalty for breaking the budget cap means a 10% reduction against what it was entitled to. So, instead of 70%, Red Bull will have 63%. This works out as 201.6 windtunnel runs and 1260 CFD items per ATP. As the sporting regulations define that these values “will be rounded up to the nearest integer”, the windtunnel runs should be rounded up to 202. That’s a reduction of 22 windtunnel runs and 140 CFD items per ATP. So, effectively, Red Bull has lost the value of 1.4 championship positions, and in doing so sacrificed an amount of windtunnel and CFD work compared to its nearest rivals that will have an impact. Red Bull’s new allowance versus rivals Per ‘Aerodynamic Testing Period’ of ~8 weeks As-it-stands 2022 position Team % of aero testing limit # of windtunnel runs # of CFD items 1 Red Bull 63 202 1260 2 Ferrari 75 240 1500 3 Mercedes 80 256 1600 The second-placed team will have 38 more windtunnel runs and 240 more CFD items in its allowance per ATP next year – which in real terms (not ATR percentages) is almost 20% more than the work Red Bull conducts. Of note is the fact that Red Bull’s limitation is valid for a period of 12 months from the date of execution of the Accepted Breach Agreement. The ABA was entered into on Wednesday, October 26. That means that Red Bull’s new limit kicks in immediately and will be valid for whatever development work it completes in the final part of 2022. While this will likely be a lower value than its rivals wanted it does mean that the final stages of Red Bull’s 2023 car development will be impacted by its aerodynamic testing limitations. And as this will carry through to the end of October next year, Red Bull will also be limited in balancing its windtunnel and CFD allowance across the in-season development of its 2023 car and any early work on the 2024 design.

Tech: Mercedes tweaks new F1 front wing design, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/tech-analysis-mercedes-tweaks-new-f1-front-wing-design/10391294/, But it emerged that some of Mercedes’ rivals had flagged concerns with the FIA about the use of a novel slot gap separator bracket design on the wing and where it lay within the regulations. Mercedes never planned to run the wing in Austin, only bringing it to the race for freight reasons, but a modified version has now emerged. Technical director Mike Elliott said last Sunday that while the team thought the wing was within the regulations, modifications may be made to avoid a challenge from rivals. The updated version of the wing has now broken cover at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez ahead of this weekend’s Mexican Grand Prix. It remains to be seen if Mercedes or if any of its rivals will pursue the style of slot gap separator bracket design seen in Austin (below, inset)., Listen to this article As part of its final F1 update package of season, Mercedes introduced a new front wing for the W13 at the United States Grand Prix last week, with the first glimpse emerging last Thursday. But it emerged that some of Mercedes’ rivals had flagged concerns with the FIA about the use of a novel slot gap separator bracket design on the wing and where it lay within the regulations. Mercedes never planned to run the wing in Austin, only bringing it to the race for freight reasons, but a modified version has now emerged. Technical director Mike Elliott said last Sunday that while the team thought the wing was within the regulations, modifications may be made to avoid a challenge from rivals. The updated version of the wing has now broken cover at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez ahead of this weekend’s Mexican Grand Prix. Given the wing’s redesign isn’t entirely reliant on the outwash-generating brackets mounted between the two upper flaps, the team appears to have removed them and replaced them with the more conventional horseshoe-like brackets. The flaps still carry the scars of where the brackets had been fixed to the flaps – the darker patches – with the team having to carefully remove them without damaging or stressing the elements. The wing will still carry the new design features in the outboard section of the wing, with the flap and endplate juncture altered to better influence the airflow and create more outwash than its predecessor. It remains to be seen if Mercedes or if any of its rivals will pursue the style of slot gap separator bracket design seen in Austin (below, inset).

Aston Martin fined $450k for F1 cost cap procedural breach, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/aston-martin-450k-fine-cost-cap-penalty/10391643/, Listen to this articleThe FIA announced after the Japanese Grand Prix that both Aston Martin and Red Bull were found to have breached the financial regulations for 2021 after completing their audits. As a result, Aston Martin has been fined $450,000 that must be paid within the next 30 days. The FIA said there was “no accusation or evidence” that Aston Martin had “sought at any time to act in bad faith, dishonesty or in a fraudulent manner” throughout the process. It also deemed that Aston Martin “did not gain or seek to gain any advantage from the inaccurate exclusions or adjustments of certain costs” in its submission. It means the matter is now closed, with no mechanism in place for any appeal or action to be taken by Aston Martin., Listen to this article The FIA announced after the Japanese Grand Prix that both Aston Martin and Red Bull were found to have breached the financial regulations for 2021 after completing their audits. Although Aston Martin was under the cost cap for last year - unlike Red Bull, which received a $7m fine and a reduction in aerodynamic testing on Friday - the FIA deemed it had committed a procedural breach, meaning it had to enter talks with F1’s governing body about an Accepted Breach Agreement. In a statement issued on Friday morning, the FIA explained that Aston Martin had “inaccurately excluded and/or adjusted costs in the calculation of its relevant costs,” including areas such as costs for its new headquarters, wind tunnel additional feels and costs relating to its new F1 simulator. As a result, Aston Martin has been fined $450,000 that must be paid within the next 30 days. The FIA said there was “no accusation or evidence” that Aston Martin had “sought at any time to act in bad faith, dishonesty or in a fraudulent manner” throughout the process. It also deemed that Aston Martin “did not gain or seek to gain any advantage from the inaccurate exclusions or adjustments of certain costs” in its submission. Mike Krack, Team Principal, Aston Martin F1, in the team principals Press Conference Photo by: FIA Pool “The Cost Cap Administration considered it appropriate, in these circumstances, to offer to Aston Martin an ABA to resolve this matter on the terms set out below, given the limited nature of the breach in issue, and AMR’s willingness to accept the breach and to cooperate with the Cost Cap Administration,” the statement adds, leading to the offer being accepted. It means the matter is now closed, with no mechanism in place for any appeal or action to be taken by Aston Martin. According to the FIA’s statement, the costs that had been incorrectly excluded or adjusted by Aston Martin were: Cost pursuant to Article 3.1(h)(i) of the Financial Regulations (concerning costs in respect of the new F1 Team headquarters) Understatement of Relevant Costs in respect of the provision set forth by Article 4.1(b)(ii) (concerning R&D tax credit) Costs pursuant to Article 3.1(h)(i) of the Financial Regulations (concerning cost in respect of the new F1 simulator) Cost pursuant to Article 3.1(o) of the Financial Regulations (concerning wind tunnel additional fees); Cost pursuant to Article 3.1(i) of the Financial Regulations (concerning certain signing bonus cost); Understatement of Relevant Costs in respect of provisions set forth by Article 4.1(a)(ii) of the Financial Regulations (concerning the use of Transferable Components); Understatement of Relevant Costs in respect of provision set forth by Article 4.1(f)(i)(B) of the Financial Regulations (concerning Used Inventories); Cost pursuant to Articles 3.1(h)(i) and 3.1(i) of the Financial Regulations (concerning service desk costs); Cost pursuant to Article 3.1(i) of the Financial Regulations (concerning cost of catering services provided to personnel at its factory headquarters); Cost pursuant to Article 3.1(i) of the Financial Regulations (concerning cost of desks and chairs); Understatement of Relevant Costs in respect of provisions set forth by Article 4.1(h) of the Financial Regulations (concerning unrecorded costs and losses in respect of the cost of services rendered by sponsors); Cost pursuant to Article 3.1(j) of the Financial Regulations (concerning cost of services rendered by outsourced personnel);

On Friday in Mexico, the FIA announced Red Bull was found to be in breach. “In these circumstances, the Cost Cap Administration offered to RBR an ABA to resolve this matter. That offer was accepted by RBR.”In the summary, it was revealed Red Bull exceeded the 2021 Cost Cap of £118,036,000 by less than 5% (£1,864.000 or 1.6%), which is a minor breach. Regarding sanctions, Red Bull must pay $7million to the FIA within 30 days of the date of execution of the ABA., Red Bull have entered an Accepted Breach Agreement (ABA) with the FIA following a breach of the 2021 Financial Regulations, F1’s governing body have said. For the first time in F1 history, all 10 teams were required to submit accounts of their annual spending against the Cost Cap for 2021 by the following March.

FIA reveals Red Bull's punishment for F1 cost cap breach, https://the-race.com/formula-1/fia-reveals-red-bulls-punishment-for-f1-cost-cap-breach/, The punishment has been decided in the form of an Accepted Breach Agreement between the FIA and Red Bull. The 13 ways Red Bull got its cost cap calculation wrong Read moreRed Bull inaccurately excluded and/or adjusted costs of £5,607,000 from its budget cap submission of £114,293,000 – which the FIA says constitutes an overspend of £1,864,000.

The fine will not impact Red Bull’s spending capabilities as financial penalties are exempt from the budget cap., Red Bull has been fined $7 million and hit with a 10% reduction of the aerodynamic testing allowance it is entitled to for the 2023 F1 season, for breaking the budget cap in 2021. The punishment has been decided in the form of an Accepted Breach Agreement between the FIA and Red Bull. The 13 ways Red Bull got its cost cap calculation wrong Read more Red Bull inaccurately excluded and/or adjusted costs of £5,607,000 from its budget cap submission of £114,293,000 – which the FIA says constitutes an overspend of £1,864,000. Had a ‘notional tax credit’ been correctly applied by Red Bull the breach would have been £432,652. The ABA is a process outlined in the financial regulations to encourage a quicker resolution and make sure the team that is punished cannot appeal the decision. Is Red Bull’s F1 cost cap penalty adequate? Our verdict Read more Red Bull was found to have committed a “minor” breach of less than 5% of the cost cap on 2021, and a procedural breach that means it made an administrative error or errors – in this case because its submission is inaccurate. No other team committed a spending breach although Williams and Aston Martin were guilty of procedural breaches. Rival teams had called for severe penalties that would hurt Red Bull if the FIA stuck by its decision that an overspend had occurred. Entering into what is effectively a plea bargain ensured Red Bull did not risk a points deduction or a reduction in its future cost cap allowances, as these are not applicable in the case of an ABA. The fine will not impact Red Bull’s spending capabilities as financial penalties are exempt from the budget cap. Losing windtunnel and CFD time for a 12-month period will have a development impact, though, during the 2023 season and in preparation for 2024. The FIA said: “Red Bull Racing was found to be in breach, however, the Cost Cap Administration recognised that Red Bull Racing has acted cooperatively throughout the review process and has sought to provide additional information and evidence when requested in a timely manner, that this is the first year of the full application of the Financial Regulations and that there is no accusation or evidence that RBR has sought at any time to act in bad faith, dishonestly or in fraudulent manner, nor has it wilfully concealed any information from the Cost Cap Administration.”

The Financial Regulations are issued by the FIA and form part of the terms and conditions of participation in the FIA Formula One World Championship. Costs pursuant to Article 3.1(k) of the Financial Regulations (in respect of bonus and associated employer’s social security contributions);5. And further that consequently its Relevant Costs for the 2021 Reporting Period exceeded the 2021 Cost Cap by £1,864,000 (1.6%). The decision of the Cost Cap Administration to enter into the ABA constitutes its final decision resolving this matter and is not subject to appeal., Listen to this article Here is the FIA’s report in full: An Accepted Breach Agreement (“ABA”) dated 26 October 2022 has been entered into by the Cost Cap Administration and Red Bull Racing F1 Team (“RBR”) pursuant to Article 6.28 of the FIA Formula 1 Financial Regulations (“Financial Regulations”). The Financial Regulations are issued by the FIA and form part of the terms and conditions of participation in the FIA Formula One World Championship. The Cost Cap Administration recognised that RBR has acted cooperatively throughout the review process and has sought to provide additional information and evidence when requested in a timely manner, that this is the first year of the full application of the Financial Regulations which are a very complex set of rules that competitors were required to adapt to and that there is no accusation or evidence that RBR has sought at any time to act in bad faith, dishonestly or in a fraudulent manner, nor has it wilfully concealed any information from the Cost Cap Administration. The Cost Cap Administration considered it appropriate, in these circumstances, to offer to RBR an ABA to resolve this matter on the terms set out below, given the limited nature of the Procedural Breach in issue and the fact that the Minor Overspend Breach falls at the lower end of the <5% minor overspend range, and RBR’s willingness to accept the breaches and to cooperate with the Cost Cap Administration. That offer was accepted by RBR. The ABA concerns: • RBR’s submitted Relevant Costs reported in its 2021 Full Year Reporting Documentation of £114,293,000; • Subsequent to the findings of the Cost Cap Administration, a Procedural Breach committed by RBR pursuant to Article 8.2(e) of the Financial Regulations due to the submission of inaccurate Full Year Reporting Documentation in respect of the Full Year Reporting Period ending on 31 December 2021 because it inaccurately excluded and/or adjusted costs amounting to a total of £5,607,000 in its 2021 Full Year Reporting Documentation; and • Consequently, a Minor Overspend Breach committed by RBR under Article 8.10(b) of the Financial Regulations because its Relevant Costs, as adjusted by the FIA, exceeded the 2021 Cost Cap of £118,036,000 by less than 5%, namely by £1,864,000 (i.e., 1.6%). Summary of ABA terms and sanctions In accordance with the findings of the Cost Cap Administration, RBR has acknowledged that the Reporting Documentation submitted by it included the following incorrectly excluded and/or adjusted costs: 1. Overstated excluded costs pursuant to Article 3.1(a) of the Financial Regulations (concerning catering services); 2. Costs pursuant to Article 3.1(w) of the Financial Regulations (concerning consideration and associated employer’s social security contributions); 3. Costs pursuant to Article 3.1(h)(i) of the Financial Regulations (in respect of Non-F1 Activities), as those costs had already been offset within Total Costs of the Reporting Group; 4. Costs pursuant to Article 3.1(k) of the Financial Regulations (in respect of bonus and associated employer’s social security contributions); 5. Understatement of Relevant Costs in respect of a gain on disposal of fixed assets by failing to make the necessary upwards adjustment; 6. Costs pursuant to Article 3.1(q) of the Financial Regulations (concerning apprenticeship levies); 7. Costs pursuant to Article 3.1(h)(ii)(i) of the Financial Regulations (concerning consideration and associated employer’s social security contributions); 8. Understatement of Relevant Costs in respect of provisions set forth by Article 4.1(a)(i) of the Financial Regulations (concerning the cost of use of Power Units); 9. Costs pursuant to Article 3.1(h) (i) of the Financial Regulations (concerning consideration and associated employer’s social security contributions); 10. Understatement of Relevant Costs in respect of provisions set forth by Article 4.1(f)(i)(B) of the Financial Regulations (concerning use of inventories); 11. Clerical error in respect of RBR’s calculation of certain costs re-charged to it by Red Bull Power Trains Limited; 12. Certain travel costs pursuant to Article 3.1(r) of the Financial Regulations; 13. Costs of maintenance pursuant to Article 3.1(i) of the Financial Regulations. And further that consequently its Relevant Costs for the 2021 Reporting Period exceeded the 2021 Cost Cap by £1,864,000 (1.6%). RBR has therefore accepted that it has breached: (i) Article 8.2(e) of the Financial Regulations due to its failure to file accurate Full Year Reporting Documentation in respect of the 2021 Full Year Reporting Period, and (ii) Article 8.10(b) of the Financial Regulations due to its failure to keep its Relevant Costs under the 2021 Cost Cap. The FIA acknowledges that had RBR applied the correct treatment within its Full Year Reporting Documentation of RBR’s Notional Tax Credit within its 2021 submission of a value of £1,431,348, it would have been considered by the Cost Cap Administration to be in compliance with Article 4.1(b) of the Regulations and therefore RBR’s Relevant Costs for the 2021 Reporting Period would have in fact exceeded the 2021 Cost Cap by £432,652 (0.37%). On that basis, RBR has accepted the imposition of the following sanctions: a) RBR must pay a Financial Penalty of USD 7,000,000 to the FIA within 30 days of the date of execution of the ABA (Article 9.5 of the Financial Regulations); b) RBR receives a Minor Sporting Penalty in the form of a limitation of RBR’s ability to conduct aerodynamic Testing during a period of 12 months from the date of execution of the ABA through the application of a reduction of 10% of the Coefficient C used to calculate the individual Restricted Wind Tunnel Testing (RWTT) and Restricted Computational Fluid Dynamics (RCFD) limits applicable to each Team as set out in Article 6 of Appendix 7 to the FIA Formula 1 Sporting Regulations. For example, if the Coefficient C, based on RBR’s championship position is 70%, the effective new value of C will be: CNEW=70% x (1-0.10) = 63.0%; and c) RBR bears the costs incurred by the Cost Cap Administration in connection with the preparation of the ABA. The decision of the Cost Cap Administration to enter into the ABA constitutes its final decision resolving this matter and is not subject to appeal. Non-compliance by RBR with any terms of the ABA will result in a further Procedural Breach under Articles 6.30 and 8.2(f) of the Financial Regulations and automatic referral to the Cost Cap Adjudication Panel.
Red Bull handed $7m fine aero testing reduction for cost cap breach, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/cost-cap-red-bull-penalty-fia/10391595/, Red Bull was deemed to have exceeded the $145 million cost cap, committing a minor breach that was less than 5% over the limit. Red Bull fiercely denied it had broken the budget cap, but entered talks with the FIA over an Accepted Breach Agreement to reach a settlement. Red Bull explained through talks with the FIA that the additional £5.6m was down to excluded costs that covered 13 areas. These included social security contributions for staff, apprenticeship levies, cost of use of the power units, and a clerical error in the calculation of costs re-charged to Red Bull by Red Bull Powertrains, among others. The Accepted Breach Agreement between the FIA and Red Bull means the case is now closed., Listen to this article The FIA revealed after the Japanese Grand Prix that both Red Bull and Aston Martin were in breach of F1’s financial regulations for 2021, putting them at risk of sanctions. Red Bull was deemed to have exceeded the $145 million cost cap, committing a minor breach that was less than 5% over the limit. Red Bull fiercely denied it had broken the budget cap, but entered talks with the FIA over an Accepted Breach Agreement to reach a settlement. The FIA's cost cap administration discuss terms with Red Bull through last week before an agreement was struck on Wednesday, while team principal Christian Horner independently met with FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem in Austin to discuss the matter. The agreement sees Red Bull admit that it broke the financial regulations, with the FIA handing the team a $7m fine that must be paid within the next 30 days. The team will also lose 10% of its aerodynamic testing time from the announcement of the Accepted Breach Agreement. The FIA said there was “no accusation or evidence” that Red Bull had “sought at any time to act in bad faith, dishonestly or in a fraudulent manner, nor has it wilfully concealed any information from the Cost Cap Administration.” News of Red Bull’s breach earlier this month led to calls from its rivals for a strict sanction to be enforced, with McLaren boss Zak Brown saying that a possible breach by any team “constitutes cheating” in a letter written to Ben Sulayem and F1 boss Stefano Domenicali ahead of the United States Grand Prix. Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB18, Sergio Perez, Red Bull Racing RB18 Photo by: Glenn Dunbar / Motorsport Images The FIA’s findings into Red Bull’s cost cap breach found that while its 2021 submission was below the cost cap, it committed a procedural breach as it “inaccurately excluded and/or adjusted costs amounting to a total of £5,607,000.” This meant the final budget total for Red Bull’s submission for last year was £118,036,000, meaning it exceeded the budget cap by £1,864,000 - or 1.6%. Red Bull explained through talks with the FIA that the additional £5.6m was down to excluded costs that covered 13 areas. These included social security contributions for staff, apprenticeship levies, cost of use of the power units, and a clerical error in the calculation of costs re-charged to Red Bull by Red Bull Powertrains, among others. The FIA also stated that had Red Bull applied the correct treatment of its Notional Tax Credit worth £1.4m as part of the submission, then it would only have been in breach by £432,652, or 0.37%. The 10% fall in aerodynamic testing will be applied in relation to Red Bulls permitted wind tunnel testing time for next season, fulfilling the minor sporting sanction that was warranted under the financial regulations for the minor breach of the cost cap. Having won the constructors’ championship, the team was due 70% of the seventh-placed team’s aerodynamic testing time, but this will now reduce by one tenth, meaning it falls to 63%. Should Ferrari and Mercedes keep second and third place in the standings, they will have 75% and 80% of P7’s aerodynamic testing time. “Red Bull Racing has therefore accepted that it has breached: (i) Article 8.2(e) of the Financial Regulations due to its failure to file accurate Full Year Reporting Documentation in respect of the 2021 Full Year Reporting Period, and (ii) Article 8.10(b) of the Financial Regulations due to its failure to keep its Relevant Costs under the 2021 Cost Cap,” read the FIA statement. The Accepted Breach Agreement between the FIA and Red Bull means the case is now closed. Horner is set to face the media at 11:30am local time in Mexico on Friday, having promised transparency over the case and Red Bull’s submission once the FIA ruling had been reached.
Max Verstappen will NOT lose world title as FIA hands Red Bull $7m fine, https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-11365797/Max-Verstappen-NOT-lose-maiden-world-title-FIA-hands-Red-Bull-7million-fine.html, Max Verstappen maiden world title will remain in his custody after the FIA decided against docking points as punishment for Red Bull's budget cap breach. The sanctions were imposed by the FIA with Red Bull agreeing to an Accepted Breach Agreement (ABA), and admission of culpability that means they will not be able challenge the findings. It is officially deemed a ‘minor breach’ and means the world title will not be taken off Max Verstappen and handed to Lewis Hamilton. Red Bull were let off further heavier sanctions because they complied with all requests and inquiries made of the FIA’s auditors. The FIA statement said: ‘Red Bull must pay a Financial Penalty of $7m to the FIA within 30 days of the date of execution of the ABA., Max Verstappen maiden world title will remain in his custody after the FIA decided against docking points as punishment for Red Bull's budget cap breach. Red Bull have been fined £6million for breaching the 2021 Formula One cost cap and have been dealt a restriction on the aerodynamic testing for the next 12 months, potentially limiting their performance in 2023. The sanctions were imposed by the FIA with Red Bull agreeing to an Accepted Breach Agreement (ABA), and admission of culpability that means they will not be able challenge the findings. The FIA and Cost Cap Administration have made it clear that 'there is no accusation or evidence that Red Bull Racing (RBR) has sought at any time to act in bad faith, dishonestly or in a fraudulent manner'. Max Verstappen will not be stripped of his 2021 world title despite Red Bull's budget breach Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has called a press conference to respond to the fines As expected Red Bull were found to be £1.8m over the spending limit of £114m, exceeding the limit by 1.6 per cent. It is officially deemed a ‘minor breach’ and means the world title will not be taken off Max Verstappen and handed to Lewis Hamilton. Red Bull were let off further heavier sanctions because they complied with all requests and inquiries made of the FIA’s auditors. The FIA statement said: ‘Red Bull must pay a Financial Penalty of $7m to the FIA within 30 days of the date of execution of the ABA. ‘Red Bull receive a Minor Sporting Penalty in the form of a limitation of Red Bull’s ability to conduct aerodynamic testing during a period of 12 months from the date of execution of the ABA through the application of a reduction of 10 per cent.’ This refers to wind tunnel time and ‘computational fluid dynamics’. An audit from the FIA of the 2021 accounts found that Red Bull committed a 'minor breach' Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has called a press conference in Mexico on Friday, ahead of the Sunday’s grand prix, to respond to the conclusions. Red Bull were in two minds as to whether to fight the charges, but would have risked a heavier penalty – and thrown Verstappen’s controversial 2021 title into jeopardy – if they had done so. They claim that the extra spending related to non-performance factors, such as sick pay, catering costs and gardening leave, as well as being impacted by a tax rebate that they accounted for wrongly in error. Max Verstappen was not bothered about the criticism of Red Bull following their cap breach The Dutchman overtook Hamilton in the final laps due to a safety car incident in Abu Dhabi But other teams have pointed out that however it is diced up, overspending has potential to increase car speed. The statement added: ‘The Cost Cap Administration recognised that Red Bull has acted cooperatively throughout the review process and has sought to provide additional information and evidence when requested in a timely manner, that this is the first year of the full application of the financial regulations which are a very complex set of rules that competitors were required to adapt to and that there is no accusation or evidence that RBR has sought at any time to act in bad faith, dishonestly or in a fraudulent manner, nor has it wilfully concealed any information from the Cost Cap Administration. ‘The Cost Cap Administration considered it appropriate, in these circumstances, to offer to RBR an ABA to resolve this matter, given the limited nature of the procedural breach in issue and the fact that the minor overspend breach falls at the lower end of the scale.’ Aston Martin have been fined £388,000 for a procedural breach because they 'inaccurately excluded and/or adjusted costs in the calculation of their relevant costs'. They have 30 days to pay up.
Red Bull’s Horner angry at ‘draconian’ punishments over F1 budget breach, https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/oct/28/red-bull-fined-6m-by-fia-over-formula-one-budget-cap-breach-in-2021-season, Red Bull have been given a $7m (£6.05m) fine and a 10% reduction in aerodynamic testing for breaching F1’s 2021 cost cap. The decision was described as draconian by the Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, who insisted the punishment would have a huge effect on his team’s future ability to compete. “I am sure it is not enough, even if they burned our wind tunnel down it would not be enough,” he said. “$7m is an enormous amount of money but the more draconian punishment is the sporting penalty, which is the use of our wind tunnel. “Any reduction in wind tunnel time is going to be detrimental., Red Bull have been given a $7m (£6.05m) fine and a 10% reduction in aerodynamic testing for breaching F1’s 2021 cost cap. The decision was described as draconian by the Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, who insisted the punishment would have a huge effect on his team’s future ability to compete. The FIA decision was issued on Friday at the Mexican Grand Prix having concluded an agreed breach agreement with Red Bull and stated that the team had exceeded the £114m cap by £1.86m, considered under the regulations as a “minor” breach. Horner insisted the penalty was severe and had been influenced by his team’s rivals. “It’s a hit, it’s a handicap,” he said. “It gives an advantage to our competitors which is why they were pushing so hard for a draconian penalty. There were other sporting penalties available but this was lobbied for hard by our competitors because it hit us the hardest.” On the likely reaction from other teams to the penalties he was blunt, stating that they would still not be satisfied. “I am sure it is not enough, even if they burned our wind tunnel down it would not be enough,” he said. The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, had no sympathy. “Nine teams complied with the regulations and stayed below the cap,” he said. “This is a sport of marginal gains, and everything else is just chatter. There’s no mitigating factor.” Horner said the team could have chosen to appeal against the decision but opted to move on. “Following the speculation and sniping that has gone on in the paddock it is in everybody’s interest to close the book today,” he said. “We accept the penalties, begrudgingly. We take it on the chin. Did we see any on-track performance? No we did not.” The financial penalty is a one-off payment, not a reduction in the team’s future budget cap and the aero restriction is a 10% reduction in time they can spend on wind tunnel or computational fluid dynamics work on their car. Max Verstappen prepares for a practice run in a gold helmet after successfully defending his world title. Photograph: Mark Thompson/Getty Images Horner insisted the aero reduction would have a major impact. “$7m is an enormous amount of money but the more draconian punishment is the sporting penalty, which is the use of our wind tunnel. Some people have said that is an insignificant penalty. Let me tell you now it is an enormous amount and represents anything between 0.25sec to 0.5sec, an enormous amount of lap time.” The FIA report stated: “There is no accusation or evidence that RBR [Red Bull Racing] has sought at any time to act in bad faith, dishonestly or in fraudulent manner.” It also noted that had Red Bull correctly applied a notional tax credit worth £1.4m they would have been in breach by only £432,652. They cited costs contributing to the overspend that included catering, social security, the new power unit wing of the team, apprenticeships, unused parts, bonuses, travel costs and non F1-activities. The decision is not likely to be well-received by other teams. Last week Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton had warned that an insufficient punishment could render the budget cap meaningless.

The financial punishment not being applied as a sporting sanction to the budget cap may be seen as a relatively minor penalty for a team used to dealing with budgets in the hundreds of millions. Equally, the sporting penalty is not the restriction that may have been expected given other teams believe the advantage Red Bull may have gained could pay off across several years. Wolff believed the sanction was not stringent enough. “I think as for any penalty, for us, it’s too little,” he said. “Any reduction in wind tunnel time is going to be detrimental. How detrimental is difficult to judge. In absolute terms, $7m is a lot of money but maybe in the bigger scheme of things for Red Bull, considering the investment they do on the power unit side and on the team, it’s not.” Quick Guide How do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?

In first practice in Mexico, Carlos Sainz topped the timesheets for Ferrari, with his teammate Charles Leclerc in second and Red Bull’s Sergio Pérez in third. In the second session, run for an extra half an hour to include a 2023 Pirelli tyre test, Mercedes’ George Russell was quickest as Leclerc crashed out. The Ferrari driver lost control going into Turn 7 and while he escaped without injury, the crash leaves his team with a major overnight repair job to ensure his car is ready for Saturday. Yuki Tsunoda of AlphaTauri was second with the Alpine of Esteban Ocon third and Hamilton in fourth.
Max Verstappen 2021 title fate decided as FIA finally reveal Red Bull cost cap punishment, https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/breaking-red-bull-punishment-fia-28352961, The FIA has announced the punishment Red Bull will receive for overspending during the 2021 F1 season, which includes both a significant fine and a sporting penaltyMax Verstappen's maiden Formula 1 world title is safe after the FIA decided against docking points as punishment for Red Bull breaching cost cap rules. This could significantly hamper Red Bull when it comes to their car development for the following season. The FIA's announcement revealed that Red Bull had overspent by £1,864,000, which was 1.6% of the total cap. Red Bull have called a press conference at 5.30pm UK time, where they are expected to go into further detail about the subject. The governing body made it clear their belief that Red Bull did not deliberately go over the cost cap, or act in bad faith., The FIA has announced the punishment Red Bull will receive for overspending during the 2021 F1 season, which includes both a significant fine and a sporting penalty Max Verstappen's maiden Formula 1 world title is safe after the FIA decided against docking points as punishment for Red Bull breaching cost cap rules. F1's governing body accused the team of a "minor" overspend during the 2021 season. Red Bull initially denied this, but it later became clear that there had been a mix-up over whether or not some specific details would or would not be included in the budget cap. Red Bull and the FIA have come to an 'accepted breach agreement' over the issue, which sees the team take responsibility for breaking the rules and accept a punishment. They will be forced to pay a hefty fine of £6m as a result, with a sporting penalty on top. But while it was in the FIA's power to retrospectively dock points from the team or their drivers, they decided instead it would be more appropriate to dock the team some vital aero testing time in 2023. This could significantly hamper Red Bull when it comes to their car development for the following season. The FIA's announcement revealed that Red Bull had overspent by £1,864,000, which was 1.6% of the total cap. The governing body also acknowledged that a significant proportion of that had come from a tax credit which was not applied correctly – had that not been the case, the figure would have come down to £432,652, or 0.37% of the cap. Red Bull have called a press conference at 5.30pm UK time, where they are expected to go into further detail about the subject. Image: PA) PA) The FIA's official document pointed to 13 different areas that have been identified in terms of items that Red Bull had incorrectly excluded in their own submissions. These included that tax bill, social security contributions and apprenticeship levies. But also included were some sporting matters. For example, there was an "understatement of relevant costs" which related to "the cost of use of power units", while there had also been a clerical error in respect to costs charged by the team's Red Bull Power Trains engine development programme. Other areas of overspend which had been rumoured, such as on catering costs and spending on travel, also turned out to be correct. The governing body made it clear their belief that Red Bull did not deliberately go over the cost cap, or act in bad faith. Rounding off the statement, the FIA said: "The decision of the cost cap administration to enter into the ABA constitutes its final decision resolving this matter, and is not subject to appeal." In a separate announcement the FIA also revealed it had reached an ABA with Aston Martin over their procedural breach of the rules. As a result, they must pay a £388,000 fine, though no sporting penalty was given to the Silverstone-based team.
Leclerc: Ferrari "getting there" against Red Bull on Sunday F1 race gains, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/leclerc-ferrari-getting-there-against-red-bull-on-sunday-f1-race-gains/10391219/, Red Bull, in turn, collected its first constructors’ crown since 2013 with three rounds to spare thanks to Max Verstappen’s victory last weekend in the United States Grand Prix. While Leclerc reckoned the F1-75 still could not fully match the major gains in pace Red Bull could find between qualifying and the race, the Monegasque said Ferrari was “getting there”. Charles Leclerc, Ferrari Photo by: Erik JuniusSpeaking in the press conference ahead of the Mexican GP this weekend, Leclerc addressed the chances of ending a winless run stretching back to the French round in late July. “I still believe that Red Bull will be the team to beat on Sunday. But of course, there is still the gap of performance on the Sunday to the Red Bull that we still need to find and improve., Listen to this article The Scuderia flew out of the blocks to win two of the opening three races this season as it sought to end a title drought dating back to its 2008 constructors’ championship triumph. But the combination of strategic disasters (notably at Silverstone and Budapest) plus its early unreliability has contributed greatly to its drivers’ and teams’ championship challenge collapsing. Red Bull, in turn, collected its first constructors’ crown since 2013 with three rounds to spare thanks to Max Verstappen’s victory last weekend in the United States Grand Prix. With its title designs slipping, Ferrari has turned its attention to preparing for 2023 by using the final races of this year to better execute its pitstops procedures and strategy calls. While Leclerc reckoned the F1-75 still could not fully match the major gains in pace Red Bull could find between qualifying and the race, the Monegasque said Ferrari was “getting there”. Charles Leclerc, Ferrari Photo by: Erik Junius Speaking in the press conference ahead of the Mexican GP this weekend, Leclerc addressed the chances of ending a winless run stretching back to the French round in late July. He said: “It is difficult to know for now. “I still believe that Red Bull will be the team to beat on Sunday. “They always seem to find something from the Saturday to the Sunday that we didn't quite find yet, but we are getting there.” When asked by Motorsport.com to clarify the areas where Ferrari felt most confident it was catching up to Red Bull, Leclerc put the focus on race execution rather than outright pace. However, he reckoned that any of the attention given to extracting more speed would pay off soon enough given the team’s ability to improve rapidly, in his own view. He continued: “I was mostly speaking about the Sunday execution, not the performance in itself. But as I've been mentioning, since a few races, we are working a lot on the strategy, on the communication side of it also. “This I feel like we are doing steps in the right direction. But of course, there is still the gap of performance on the Sunday to the Red Bull that we still need to find and improve. “On that, we are working. We haven't found yet the solution. But we are working well. “Once we are focusing on one thing, we normally improve very quickly on it. So, I'm confident that the results will come soon.” Leclerc enters the weekend second in the drivers’ standings, only two points ahead of Red Bull’s Sergio Perez.

What Mercedes' toned-down new F1 front wing still achieves, https://the-race.com/formula-1/what-mercedes-toned-down-new-f1-front-wing-still-achieves/, It looks like the Mercedes Formula 1 team has conceded its new front wing with multiple slot gap separators angled outwards to generate outwash did go a bit further than the regulations defined. The wing appeared in the Austin paddock but was not used during the United States Grand Prix weekend, and Mercedes admitted it had an “exchange” with the FIA about the design. Mercedes removes contentious element of upgraded front wing Read moreThe revised version that will be used in Mexico practice does not have the separators. In that area Mercedes has more or less gone back to what it ran previously. However there are other details on the revised wing endplate that will alter how it sets up the flow structure for the aerodynamic surfaces that are coming along behind it., It looks like the Mercedes Formula 1 team has conceded its new front wing with multiple slot gap separators angled outwards to generate outwash did go a bit further than the regulations defined. The wing appeared in the Austin paddock but was not used during the United States Grand Prix weekend, and Mercedes admitted it had an “exchange” with the FIA about the design. Mercedes removes contentious element of upgraded front wing Read more The revised version that will be used in Mexico practice does not have the separators. In that area Mercedes has more or less gone back to what it ran previously. However there are other details on the revised wing endplate that will alter how it sets up the flow structure for the aerodynamic surfaces that are coming along behind it. The increased twist in the trailing edge of the endplate (red line) is the most noticeable. This should allow for the trailing edge of the ski ramp section (blue line) to be wider, increasing the amount of airflow it can pull upwards, which in turn will pull more flow through the opening in the bottom rear corner of the endplates. This bottom rear corner detail, which has swept the ends of the intersection of the flaps to the endplate forward, was introduced quite a few races ago. It itself sets up a stronger vortex further forward than most other designs, and this vortex then connects up with the tyre squirt – which is what happens when the tyre rotates onto the track surface. If this all works together it will increase the outwash. The loss of the upper surface turning vanes that have now been removed will be detrimental to its overall performance but getting 50% of the benefit is better than getting none of it. As I have said before, if the FIA really wants to reduce the potential for the teams to create outwash concepts then it should simply make the wing 100mm narrower on each side. This would move this area of flow optimisation to more or less the middle of the front tyre, and as a side benefit it might also just reduce the number of front wing endplates we see damaged in first lap skirmishes.
Leclerc: Ferrari "getting there" against Red Bull on Sunday F1 race gains, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/leclerc-ferrari-getting-there-against-red-bull-on-sunday-f1-race-gains/10391219/, Red Bull, in turn, collected its first constructors’ crown since 2013 with three rounds to spare thanks to Max Verstappen’s victory last weekend in the United States Grand Prix. While Leclerc reckoned the F1-75 still could not fully match the major gains in pace Red Bull could find between qualifying and the race, the Monegasque said Ferrari was “getting there”. Charles Leclerc, Ferrari Photo by: Erik JuniusSpeaking in the press conference ahead of the Mexican GP this weekend, Leclerc addressed the chances of ending a winless run stretching back to the French round in late July. “I still believe that Red Bull will be the team to beat on Sunday. But of course, there is still the gap of performance on the Sunday to the Red Bull that we still need to find and improve., Listen to this article The Scuderia flew out of the blocks to win two of the opening three races this season as it sought to end a title drought dating back to its 2008 constructors’ championship triumph. But the combination of strategic disasters (notably at Silverstone and Budapest) plus its early unreliability has contributed greatly to its drivers’ and teams’ championship challenge collapsing. Red Bull, in turn, collected its first constructors’ crown since 2013 with three rounds to spare thanks to Max Verstappen’s victory last weekend in the United States Grand Prix. With its title designs slipping, Ferrari has turned its attention to preparing for 2023 by using the final races of this year to better execute its pitstops procedures and strategy calls. While Leclerc reckoned the F1-75 still could not fully match the major gains in pace Red Bull could find between qualifying and the race, the Monegasque said Ferrari was “getting there”. Charles Leclerc, Ferrari Photo by: Erik Junius Speaking in the press conference ahead of the Mexican GP this weekend, Leclerc addressed the chances of ending a winless run stretching back to the French round in late July. He said: “It is difficult to know for now. “I still believe that Red Bull will be the team to beat on Sunday. “They always seem to find something from the Saturday to the Sunday that we didn't quite find yet, but we are getting there.” When asked by Motorsport.com to clarify the areas where Ferrari felt most confident it was catching up to Red Bull, Leclerc put the focus on race execution rather than outright pace. However, he reckoned that any of the attention given to extracting more speed would pay off soon enough given the team’s ability to improve rapidly, in his own view. He continued: “I was mostly speaking about the Sunday execution, not the performance in itself. But as I've been mentioning, since a few races, we are working a lot on the strategy, on the communication side of it also. “This I feel like we are doing steps in the right direction. But of course, there is still the gap of performance on the Sunday to the Red Bull that we still need to find and improve. “On that, we are working. We haven't found yet the solution. But we are working well. “Once we are focusing on one thing, we normally improve very quickly on it. So, I'm confident that the results will come soon.” Leclerc enters the weekend second in the drivers’ standings, only two points ahead of Red Bull’s Sergio Perez.

Sainz: FIA “a bit easy” on Russell with US GP F1 collision penalty, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/sainz-fia-a-bit-easy-on-russell-with-us-gp-collision-penalty/10391419/, Listen to this articleRussell nudged polesitter Sainz into a spin, sending him to the back of the field. The Ferrari driver pitted at the end of the lap and had to retire due to the damage caused in the clash. Sainz believes Russell should have been given a bigger penalty, although he appreciated the fact that the Mercedes man went straight from parc ferme to find him in the Ferrari camp and apologise. “Of course, it always honours the guy who does that straight away after the race,” said Sainz when asked by Motorsport.com about Russell’s quick apology. “Beating them to pole and fighting with them for pole is what leaves me calmer about the whole situation., Listen to this article Russell nudged polesitter Sainz into a spin, sending him to the back of the field. The Ferrari driver pitted at the end of the lap and had to retire due to the damage caused in the clash. Russell was given a five-second penalty that he took at his first pitstop, before going on to finish the race in fifth place, his own performance compromised by damage to his front wing. Sainz believes Russell should have been given a bigger penalty, although he appreciated the fact that the Mercedes man went straight from parc ferme to find him in the Ferrari camp and apologise. “Of course, it always honours the guy who does that straight away after the race,” said Sainz when asked by Motorsport.com about Russell’s quick apology. “I always respect that. It doesn't mean that I am happy. I think that the FIA also maybe was a bit easy on him for the consequences that happened.” Asked if he could have done anything to avoid the contact, Sainz said: “I don't think I could have done something very different. I was in the middle of a battle with Max [Verstappen], Max went long and obviously had to brake a lot at the exit of the corner. “We were both already getting out of the corner while George I think hadn't even done the corner and bumped into me, which is a shame. “It's the kind of incident that you expect to see more in the midfield, when there's so many cars around you. But in the top four, I've never seen that incident happen that often. “That's why I was so frustrated after the race. I obviously accepted George's apologies because it was good by him. But yeah, it was nothing I could have done." “It was one of the toughest moments of the season,” he later said. “Very disappointing, because after doing a perfect weekend up until then for your race to be ruined by something out of your control is really tough. “It's been also a few times this year, which makes it particularly frustrating to not do races, because it's what we all go to those places to do. But it's how it goes sometimes in motorsport, or in life, you go through rough patches and other easier ones. “It seems that this year, everything that could happen to me, it's happening. I hope I can get them all out of the way this year for next year to have a smooth one.” Sainz stressed that the most encouraging outcome of Austin was that he proved he could get pole in a straight fight in dry conditions. “On the positive side, the fact that I have the speed is the thing that leaves me a lot more calm about this year. “The fact that I managed to come back through a very difficult start to the season and still managed to re-do myself, re-invent myself with my driving style, with my car, with my set-up, to all of a sudden be in the fight with the two guys that are most in form in F1 right now, that is Charles [Leclerc] and Max. “Beating them to pole and fighting with them for pole is what leaves me calmer about the whole situation. If they're going to keep bumping into me in turn ones or I’m going to keep DNF'ing for whatever reasons, it's frustrating, but not for long, when I know if I have the speed. “Normally the sport gives you back what you what it takes from you sooner or later. So I'm going to take the positives in that sense.”
Mexican GP: what time is the race? And can anyone beat Verstappen?, https://www.topgear.com/car-news/formula-one/mexican-gp-what-time-race-and-can-anyone-beat-verstappen, Where is the Mexican GP taking place? The circuit has hosted an F1 race in various layouts from 1962-1970 and 1986-1992, before making yet another comeback in 2015. Let’s see…How can I watch the Mexican GP? What’s the Top Gear view on the Mexican GP? We love the Mexican GP: the race is usually pretty good and the passion from the fans gives the event a special kind of energy few other grands prix can match., F1 visits Mexico City this weekend, and Max Verstappen is on the hunt for a record-breaking 14th win of the season We’re almost at the end of the 2022 season now, with the Mexican Grand Prix the first of three races left to complete before the drivers trade in their helmets for Christmas party hats. There’s lots going on off track too. Fernando Alonso has already had his P7 points finish last week reinstated, after he was controversially penalised for driving a damaged car despite his Alpine team not being ordered to fix it. That said, there’s still lots to play for. Victory for Verstappen would see him set a record for the most F1 wins in a single season (he’s currently tied with Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel on 13), and don’t forget that Lewis Hamilton still hasn’t won a race this year having taken the chequered flag at least once in every campaign of his career so far… Below you’ll find everything you need to know about the Mexican GP ahead of the race. Please continue scrolling in 3… 2… 1… And rumour has it that Red Bull has reached an ‘accepted breach agreement’ regarding its breaking of the cost cap in 2021 . We’re yet to learn what the penalty for that will be. For British viewers, qualifying begins at 9pm on Saturday 29 October, while the race itself is set to start at 8pm sharp on Sunday 30th. Don’t forget that the clocks go back an hour between these sessions, so if you’re still living your life by a mechanical timepiece, you can’t blame us for tuning in for the race an hour earlier than you’d like. For the die hard fans who get a kick out of the practice sessions as well, FP1 gets underway at 7pm on Friday, followed by FP2 at 10pm. The third and final shakedown before quali starts at 6pm on Saturday. What’s the weather going to be like? The current forecast suggests that rain could be a factor on all three days of action in Mexico, although any precipitation will likely be interspersed with spells of sunshine. F1 cars aren’t exactly equipped to deal with torrential downpours right now - as the Japanese GP proved - so let’s hope for some light showers to mix things up. Where is the Mexican GP taking place? The Mexican GP is being held at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, named after brothers Ricardo and Pedro who both raced in F1 in the 1960s but whose lives were tragically cut short in crashes. The circuit has hosted an F1 race in various layouts from 1962-1970 and 1986-1992, before making yet another comeback in 2015. It’s been a mainstay on the calendar since then, with the exception of 2020 when that-bloody-plague-19 meant it had to be cancelled. How many laps is the Mexican GP? The track is 4.304km long (2.674 miles if you prefer imperial), which means 71 laps are required for the full, FIA-approved race distance of 300km. Last year Valtteri Bottas grabbed pole position with a time of 1:15.875, but the race was won by a certain Max Verstappen… Who’s going to win the Mexican GP? So far this season Max Verstappen has won 13 races and everyone else combined has managed… six. Two of which were Sergio Perez in an identical car. So if you’re betting on anything other than a Dutch-driven Red Bull prevailing on Sunday, you are either very brave or simply immune to pattern recognition. The Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz could challenge given how quick they usually are in qualifying. And Mercedes boss Toto Wolff is reportedly talking up his team’s chances this weekend given the unusual characteristics of the track. Let’s see… How can I watch the Mexican GP? Ring a travel agent and see what flights are left near you, if you run to the gate you might still make it… Oh, you meant on telly? Well, UK fans have two options: watch the race on Sky Sports’ dedicated F1 channel, or take out a Now TV subscription in order to stream Sky Sports’ dedicated F1 channel. The free option is to wait for the coverage on Channel 4: quali highlights will be broadcast at 12.30pm on Sunday, with race highlights to follow that night from 1.05am on Monday morning. You might need cocktail sticks to keep those eyelids open. Alternatively, BBC Radio 5 Live will have live commentary of the race via the airwaves. So you can let your imagination do the rest. What’s the Top Gear view on the Mexican GP? We love the Mexican GP: the race is usually pretty good and the passion from the fans gives the event a special kind of energy few other grands prix can match. The news that the race will stay on the F1 calendar until the end of 2025 is great news for the sport, and although we’d never endorse any favouritism you’ve got to admit it’d be pretty cool to see Sergio Perez win his home race. Come on Sergio, we’re all rooting for you.
Alpine’s protest regarding Alonso penalty ruled inadmissible, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.alpines-protest-regarding-alonso-penalty-ruled-inadmissible.513rj0hWXR5ZqlAUHFrCo5.html, The FIA Stewards have ruled that Alpine's protest over Haas's post-race dispute in Austin is not admissible – but the French manufacturers have requested a right of review over the case. On Sunday night in the United States, Haas lodged a protest on the grounds that Alonso and Sergio Perez's cars were in an unsafe condition after separate incidents for those drivers. Perez was not sanctioned but Alonso was given a 30-second post-race penalty in Austin as his car was not deemed to be in a "safe condition" after he had collided with Lance Stroll. The two-time champion was therefore demoted from seventh to 15th. Alpine then disputed Haas's protests on the grounds that they had been lodged too late – 24 minutes past the specified deadline – but the FIA concluded in Mexico City that "there is no ability or right for any party to “protest” a decision of the Stewards nor against a summons to a hearing.", The FIA Stewards have ruled that Alpine's protest over Haas's post-race dispute in Austin is not admissible – but the French manufacturers have requested a right of review over the case.

Daniel Ricciardo dismisses Mercedes links and insists he wants Lewis Hamilton to STAY in Formula One, https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-11365391/Daniel-Ricciardo-dismisses-Mercedes-links-insists-wants-Lewis-Hamilton-STAY-Formula-One.html, Daniel Ricciardo has rubbished rumours he could sign for Mercedes as reserve driver before replacing Lewis Hamilton, insisting he wants the Briton to remain in the sport. His stance has made a move to the reserve ranks a possibility, with reports linking Ricciardo to Mercedes as Hamilton's successor first reported by Sportsmail earlier this year. Those rumours intensified when Ricciardo was spotted leaving the Mercedes garage ahead of the Singapore Grand Prix. Hamilton has since revealed he intends to sign a new multi-year deal with Mercedes, a decision Ricciardo insisted would not impact his future plans. Hamilton, meanwhile, has made clear he believes Ricciardo should not settle for a reserve driver role next season., Daniel Ricciardo has rubbished rumours he could sign for Mercedes as reserve driver before replacing Lewis Hamilton, insisting he wants the Briton to remain in the sport. The Australian will leave McLaren at the end of the season despite having still 12 months to run on his three-year deal, with the Woking-based team agreeing to a $14million payout in order to replace him with fellow Aussie Oscar Piastri. With the uncompetitive Williams and Haas currently the only teams yet to finalise their line-ups ahead of next season, it seems likely Ricciardo will not be on the grid in 2023. Daniel Ricciardo will leave McLaren at the end of the year after two troubled seasons The Perth-born star admitted he was likely to 'hit pause' on his Formula One career next year, but insisted he targeted a return to the sport in 2024. His stance has made a move to the reserve ranks a possibility, with reports linking Ricciardo to Mercedes as Hamilton's successor first reported by Sportsmail earlier this year. Those rumours intensified when Ricciardo was spotted leaving the Mercedes garage ahead of the Singapore Grand Prix. Hamilton has since revealed he intends to sign a new multi-year deal with Mercedes, a decision Ricciardo insisted would not impact his future plans. The 33-year-old is currently without a seat for the 2023 Formula One season The Australian has been linked with Mercedes as either a reserve driver or a potential replacement for Lewis Hamilton Ricciardo was spotted leaving the Mercedes garage ahead of the Singapore Grand Prix 'My future is not relative to what others do,' he said ahead of the Mexican Grand Prix. 'Opportunities will arise when they do. But I'm not banking on anyone doing something so that I can [step in]. 'I want to take the time that is necessary, keep a little distance to the sport, to rebuild myself. 'If something makes sense in 2024 I will come back with a vengeance, have some fun, and hopefully race at the front.' But Hamilton has since signalled he intends to sign a new deal with Mercedes While the prospect of replacing Hamilton at Mercedes may seem alluring, Ricciardo insisted he wanted the seven-time world champion to put off any retirement plans. 'The truth is that I want him to stay in the sport,' he said. 'He's one of the greatest to ever do it. Competing with him, going wheel-to-wheel with him, is awesome. I wish to do more of that in the future. That's where it currently lies.' Hamilton, meanwhile, has made clear he believes Ricciardo should not settle for a reserve driver role next season. Ricciardo has also been linked with a reunion with Red Bull boss Christian Horner (right) 'I think he should be racing, personally,' the 37-year-old, who is still searching for his first win of the season, said. 'I think he's far too talented, and he's earned the right to be amongst us all racing. 'But of course, if he's part of our team that'd be great. But a third [driver] role is not really, I think, what's best for him. 'If I were managing him, he would be racing.'
The failings exposed yet again in FIA's F1 penalty U-turn, https://the-race.com/formula-1/the-failings-exposed-yet-again-in-fias-f1-penalty-u-turn/, Alonso gets US GP seventh place back as penalty overturned Read moreThis all ultimately came down to timing. We had several of these ‘right of review’ cases in F1 last season. Alpine’s own protest of that protest was rejected partly on the grounds that it too came too late: 68 minutes after a decision was published on the Haas protest. Quite amusing that a protest about a protest being submitted too late was then thrown out for being submitted too late! But throwing out the original Haas protest and reinstating Alonso doesn’t solve this problem., Fernando Alonso’s US Grand Prix ‘penalty-that-wasn’t-a-penalty’ is another bizarre episode that yet again calls into question the FIA’s ability to implement Formula 1’s rules and procedures correctly. Alonso finished a battling seventh in a crippled car at Austin last Sunday, only to have that result overturned by a post-race penalty incorrectly applied according to F1’s statutes. It is right that the decision was overturned by a review panel the following Thursday in Mexico, but that doesn’t mean justice was done. Alonso gets US GP seventh place back as penalty overturned Read more This all ultimately came down to timing. Having been on the receiving end of several mechanical failure ‘meatball’ flags this season, for basically minor front wing endplate damage, Haas was rightly furious to see several cars – George Russell’s Mercedes, Sergio Perez’s Red Bull and Alonso’s Alpine in particular – finish the US GP carrying similar superficial damage without being required to visit the pits for repairs. Haas chose to protest Alonso’s car, which was obviously battered after launching over Lance Stroll’s Aston Martin and finished in a disheveled state with a wing mirror missing. Haas was correct to essentially ask why this car was allowed to continue without being meatball flagged when Kevin Magnussen’s Haas has repeatedly had to pit for new front wings when only carrying very minor endplate damage. Haas protested Alpine, the stewards upheld that protest and penalised Alonso, Alpine protested the Haas protest, the stewards ruled Alpine’s protest inadmissible, Alpine then applied for a ‘right of review’ and successfully overturned the original Haas protest following that review. We had several of these ‘right of review’ cases in F1 last season. Mercedes unsuccessfully tried to have the decision not to penalise Max Verstappen during the Brazilian GP reviewed, arguing onboard footage showed Verstappen had forced Hamilton off the circuit. The stewards did not agree this footage was significant enough to reconsider their original ‘play on’ verdict (perhaps helped by the fact Hamilton won that race regardless). Following the infamous Hamilton/Verstappen collision at Silverstone, where Hamilton overcame a time penalty for his part in that crash to win the race anyway, an incensed Red Bull team subsequently used Alex Albon and an old car on a filming day to simulate alternate outcomes for that incident, then tried to submit this as fresh evidence Hamilton could have driven differently and avoided the crash – so should have been penalised more harshly. For a right of review to succeed, F1’s stewards have to determine there exists a ‘significant and new element’ of evidence that wasn’t available at the time. In the Red Bull case, the stewards ruled the ‘new evidence’ inadmissible because it was essentially manufactured after the fact rather than something everyone had simply missed at the time. Gary Anderson: F1 should have more penalties like Alonso’s Read more In the case of Alonso, this all came down to timing – and a misunderstanding of timing. Haas lodged its original protest 24 minutes too late, but was incorrectly told after questioning the decision not to meatball flag Alonso’s car during the race that it had an hour to lodge a protest. Alpine’s own protest of that protest was rejected partly on the grounds that it too came too late: 68 minutes after a decision was published on the Haas protest. Quite amusing that a protest about a protest being submitted too late was then thrown out for being submitted too late! But Alpine was subsequently able to meet the ‘right of review’ threshold for new evidence by arguing it hadn’t known about the lateness of the original Haas protest until the stewards issued their decision to penalise Alonso – almost five hours after the US GP provisional classification was published – meaning Alpine and the stewards might have acted differently if this fact was known to Alpine sooner. More importantly, Alpine didn’t find out until the preliminary review hearing in Mexico that Haas had been incorrectly advised it had a full hour within which to lodge its original protest, rather than the standard 30 minutes as defined in the FIA’s International Sporting Code. Helpfully, the stewards who made the original decisions in Austin – Garry Connelly, Enrique Bernoldi, Silvia Bellot and Dennis Dean – have rolled on to adjudicate the Mexican GP too. They decided to proceed with the right of review based on the submissions of Alpine’s Alan Permane. F1’s new controversy is odd, but has major implications Read more In that review, Alpine correctly argued the stewards are not allowed to extend the protest deadline unless it is “impossible” for that protest to be submitted within 30 minutes of a race classification, and that Haas could have met this deadline. For its own part, Haas admitted it would have submitted a timely protest had it not been incorrectly advised it had an hour to do so by an FIA official in race control. This last fact is ultimately why Alpine won its case and Alonso was re-instated to seventh place in the US GP results. So once again we have witnessed a drawn-out and confusing case of the FIA either not understanding or misinterpreting its own regulations and then incorrectly applying them. You could argue Haas should have known better, ignored what it was being told, and just submitted its original protest on time. But you would also expect FIA officials to advise teams correctly according to the rules, and to check first if they don’t know. Alonso argued in the build-up to this hearing that it was “a very important day for our sport” because “it will open a huge problem for the future in Formula 1. I think 50%, 60%, 70% of the cars will have to retire when they have an aerodynamic device that is not properly fixed because it’s going to be unsafe”. But throwing out the original Haas protest and reinstating Alonso doesn’t solve this problem. Alonso says “the FIA was not showing me the black and orange flag, so they thought that the car was safe to keep driving”, but the fact is the car wasn’t safe according to how the rules were applied to Magnussen earlier this season. ﻿ Toto Wolff described Russell’s front wing as “massively damaged” and said “we were surprised that it was not a DNF”. Perez’s endplate flew off his car during the race, after which Red Bull successfully argued to the FIA that the wing was then structurally sound. But the laps Perez did with the endplate flapping around and then coming loose were plainly dangerous. What if that part had hit someone in the face at close to 200mph? Similarly, Alonso’s right-hand wing mirror broke loose towards the end of the race, while he was overtaking – of all people – Magnussen’s Haas. Thankfully, no one else was following close enough behind to be struck by that errant part. As the stewards noted during the original protest and counter-protest in Austin, they were “deeply concerned” the black and orange flag wasn’t shown to Alonso during the US GP. It wasn’t, but it should have been. Article 2.4.4.1 c) of the ISC states: “This flag should be used to inform the driver concerned that his car has mechanical problems likely to endanger himself or others and means that he must stop at his pit on the next lap. When the mechanical problems have been rectified to the satisfaction of the chief scrutineer, the car may rejoin the race.” If Magnussen’s Haas met the threshold for this earlier in the season (multiple times) then certainly Alonso’s Alpine and Perez’s Red Bull should have been flagged down before parts tore off their cars. Either the FIA was wrong to flag down Magnussen, or it was wrong not to flag down Alonso and Perez. Thankfully, the FIA is now reviewing its process again. As the same stewards noted once more in their submission following Alpine’s successful right of review: “The stewards are, notwithstanding the above determinations, concerned that Car 14 [Alonso] was permitted to remain on track with a mirror assembly hanging loose which finally fell off, and strongly recommends procedures be put in place to monitor such matters and where necessary, require the problem to be rectified as has been done multiple times in the past, through either a radio call to the team or display of the black and orange flag, requiring the car to return to the pits for the problem to be repaired. “Teams also have a responsibility under the FIA Formula 1 Sporting Regulations Article 3.2 [Competitors must ensure that their cars comply with the conditions of eligibility and safety throughout each practice session, sprint session and the race]. We also understand the FIA President has initiated a review into the use of the black and orange flag.” But no team is going to voluntarily pit a car in case it might be considered unsafe by someone else. Unless it knows categorically itself that the damage has rendered a car an immediate and serious danger, or simply unable to race on without repairs, the team will always wait for the FIA to adjudicate. That’s what the FIA is there to do. There’s been so much upheaval in Formula 1 recently. Brand new technical regulations to police, during a massive and necessary overhaul of how the FIA operates and polices races. But after the furore of Abu Dhabi 2021, then the shambles of Max Verstappen’s recent title win in Japan, plus the concerning scenes of a recovery tractor on track while cars were speeding past in awful conditions, it’s disappointing to see the FIA flexing its muscles over strict application of certain F1 rules and procedures – right down to what drivers wear under their overalls – without seemingly being able to write them properly, read them correctly, or apply them consistently. And no this doesn’t mean Abu Dhabi could have been overturned as well, they are two completely different cases with the only similarity being the damning failures of the system. The Abu Dhabi controversy centered around the interpretation of regulations while in the Alonso case, the stewards stood by their interpretation but overturned the penalty on administrative grounds. This presidential review of the use of the black and orange flag in F1 is either going to require an admission of failure on the FIA’s part in Austin, or an admission it was too strict in using the flag on Magnussen earlier in the season. The FIA cannot have it both ways. Alonso may feel justice has been done on this occasion, but Haas still has the right to feel hard done by. Safety is the FIA’s ultimate responsibility here, and now we’ve had two races in a row where apparently dangerous things have been allowed to happen anyway. It’s difficult to foresee any scenario where the FIA will allow itself to interpret rules covering car safety in a less stringent way. So that means the events of Austin must be considered an aberration rather than something that sets a new precedent. This means if 70% of cars have to be retired to prevent bits of debris from flying into the path of oncoming traffic then so be it.

Russell: "Really exciting" Hamilton plans to sign new Mercedes F1 deal, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/russell-really-exciting-hamilton-plans-to-sign-new-mercedes-f1-deal/10391398/, Hamilton revealed in an interview with select media including Autosport over the United States Grand Prix weekend that he intends to sign a new deal with Mercedes. Russell started working fully alongside Hamilton this year after spending the past three seasons with Williams, giving him a chance to learn from the seven-time world champion. Russell has a multi-year deal in place with Mercedes, and said it was “really exciting” to think that Hamilton would be continuing “for a number of years” and perform at a high level. “That’s really exciting for me, to have the opportunity to be his teammate, to go directly head-to-head with him, and go on this journey we’re on together. Should neither Russell nor Hamilton reach the top step of the podium before the season is out, it would mark Mercedes’ first winless campaign since 2011., Hamilton revealed in an interview with select media including Autosport over the United States Grand Prix weekend that he intends to sign a new deal with Mercedes. His current contract expires at the end of next season. Russell started working fully alongside Hamilton this year after spending the past three seasons with Williams, giving him a chance to learn from the seven-time world champion. Russell has a multi-year deal in place with Mercedes, and said it was “really exciting” to think that Hamilton would be continuing “for a number of years” and perform at a high level. “I think he’s proven that he’s definitely not lifted his foot off the throttle pedal,” said Russell ahead of this weekend's Mexican GP. “He’s definitely [in] the last few races performing probably better than ever. “That’s really exciting for me, to have the opportunity to be his teammate, to go directly head-to-head with him, and go on this journey we’re on together. “It really does feel like a journey that the two of us are on, along with the rest of the team, in trying to bring Mercedes back to winning ways. “We’ve got a really great relationship, a transparent relationship. It would be great to be teammates for a number of years to come.” Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes AMG, George Russell, Mercedes AMG, on stage Photo by: Steve Etherington / Motorsport Images Hamilton and Russell have found themselves working to try and turn Mercedes’ fortunes around this year after the team struggled to get to grips with the new technical regulations for 2022. Russell scored Mercedes’ only pole of the season so far at the Hungarian Grand Prix back in July, and 20 points clear of Hamilton in the points standings with three races remaining. Should neither Russell nor Hamilton reach the top step of the podium before the season is out, it would mark Mercedes’ first winless campaign since 2011. Russell felt there was “a win in all of us if the right opportunity arises” but said the stars would have to perfectly align for Mercedes to stand a chance of breaking its duck. “It is exciting for us as a team that we’ve had a couple of opportunities this year to fight,” he said. “But I think we have to have our very, very best day, and execute everything perfectly, and our rivals need to have mishaps and mistakes to give us half a chance. “We know where we lie in terms of overall performance. I think we’re just going out there in these last final three races to do the best job possible, and see what comes from that.”
Formula E to delay return of pitstops amid reliability woes, https://the-race.com/formula-e/formula-e-to-delay-return-of-pitstops-amid-reliability-woes/, Plans to introduce fast-charging pitstops in Formula E as part of the sporting format are set to be put on ice for 2023 – at least on a permanent basis. There are six registered manufacturers now in Formula E – DS, Jaguar, Mahindra, Nissan NIO 333 and Porsche. It’s a world championship of FIA, and I clearly do not expect changes in the sporting format over the season. After brilliance, anger and loss, a Formula E era is over Read moreAfter homologations next month. The Race understands that as of last week a final tyre compound was not 100% confirmed for next season., Plans to introduce fast-charging pitstops in Formula E as part of the sporting format are set to be put on ice for 2023 – at least on a permanent basis. The Race had learned that the rapid charging booster, which has been trialed in private testing over the last few months, will not be ready for wholesale use but could still make appearances in some selected races in the first Gen3 season next year. Even a temporary USA absence isn’t acceptable for Formula E Read more However, an introduction midway through the 2023 season has been called into question by one of the championship’s prestige manufacturers, Porsche, who strongly expressed its expectation for a consistent sporting format. Formula E had planned to have fast-charge pitstops as a core part of the race formats for the start of the Gen3 era but issues surrounding the cells of the RESS batteries have created a knock-on effect whereby it will not be possible to have pitstops immediately when the 2023 season begins this coming January. Williams Advanced Engineering is providing both the spec RESS and the planned fast-charging booster infrastructure for the new Formula E era but has been fighting an issue with the RESS since the summer. What happened at manufacturers’ secret Gen3 Formula E test Read more The Race first reported issues last month with the spec RESS after several manufacturers had test days curtailed due to problems that were found to stem from vibrations affecting the cells within the new smaller and lighter battery. It is not clear why the issues only became visible this summer via manufacturer testing and not before when a test car run by Spark Racing Technologies with the FIA Gen3 technical team conducted several lengthy test sessions with test drivers Benoit Treluyer and Theo Pouchaire. It is understood that further recent bench tests have identified and found a possible solution for the RESS issue but the delays in test and development time are likely to cause further delays in getting fast-charging boosters properly tested for the 2023 season. Homologations of the Gen3 cars were originally scheduled to take place in October but were postponed until the first weeks of November. There are six registered manufacturers now in Formula E – DS, Jaguar, Mahindra, Nissan NIO 333 and Porsche. All bar one of them, NIO 333, will supply an independent team with DS providing powertrains to Maserati; Porsche to Andretti, Jaguar to Envision, Mahindra to ABT and Nissan to the new McLaren squad. Speaking to The Race about the potential of having fast-charging pitstops as the FIA and Formula E wanted for next season, Porsche’s Florian Modlinger positioned Porsche clearly on its stance for the sporting format confirmation which is yet to be fully confirmed. “We have had the chance to test this technology already but only a few tests, but what we tested worked,” Modlinger told The Race. Formula E’s finest ‘what if’ driver heads for the sidelines Read more “I think it’s more a topic or issue of getting the parts and everything being ready for the season start.” On whether or not fast charging will be a part of the regulations Modlinger said that he thought that was “for other people to answer, not me.” “But in general, I want to position ourselves and myself quite clear. It’s a professional championship. It’s a world championship of FIA, and I clearly do not expect changes in the sporting format over the season. “This means the clear wish to such a championship and expectation is to have a consistent sporting regulation over the whole season.” The Race understands that recent discussions have detailed the possibility of introducing fast-charging pitstops in the second half of the 2023 campaign at pre-selected races. Should this be implemented it would demand extraordinary mid-season flexibility in the sporting regulations and it’s not just Porsche who would be against this, as it’s believed to be unpopular among several other manufacturers too. Formula E teams are facing a race against time to get the Gen3 cars into a state of readiness for the start of the world championship at the Circuit Hermanos Rodriguez in 11 weeks’ time. After brilliance, anger and loss, a Formula E era is over Read more After homologations next month. manufacturers and teams will have a short period to complete their private testing before heading to Valencia for at least three days of final running before free practice in Mexico City. The main suppliers for the Gen3 era – Williams Advanced Engineering and Hankook – are being managed via the Spark Racing Technologies company under the FIA Gen3 project team. They are coming under significant pressure to ensure that common parts and components are committed on time. This has been complicated by the RESS issues and also by further testing on different tyre compounds recently. The Race understands that as of last week a final tyre compound was not 100% confirmed for next season. Hankook’s chief engineer of Motorsport, Thomas Baltes, told The Race late last month that compound specs were still being tested and that a shift away from the initially mooted fast-charging pitstops would not be too significant. “I wouldn’t say so [the loss of fast charging would affect Hankook],” said Baltes. “Depending on the ways forward, which will also come up in Season 10 or 11 perhaps, we may also adapt our spec, but at the moment there is no need. “I would say, still we’re looking for any other solutions for the future, for sure, and it’s also depending on the ways forward, where we are going, if we have for example a pit stop or whatever. “For sure, we’re looking for different compounds, but actually I would say we’re on a quite good base which is also even tested by most of the teams and they agreed that it can go like this.” Several meetings have taken place in recent weeks to attempt a way forward in ironing out this ever-growing range of challenges for Formula E heading into 2023. An across-the-grid spirit of collaboration does exist with some knowledge of the Gen3 package being shared between manufacturers as they share some circuits and tests. McLaren team principal, Ian James, highlighted this to The Race last week, saying that “for manufacturers and therefore for teams, the maturity of the product that we start the season with the beginning of next year is going to be absolutely key. “Not only that it’s important that as the manufacturers are going through their testing at the moment and their development, that they have a foundation on which they can build because it’s not only about the battery or the tyres, but there’s also the whole maturity of the manufacturer perimeter as well. “So, I think it’s important that quickly now we get into a situation where we’ve got the reliability and stability in the package, that the manufacturer development sort of be brought to a point where we’ve got to the right level of maturity for season nine (2023). “I know that everybody involves working very hard to achieve that, so the right discussions are taking place. “We’ve got constant dialogue with the FIA with FEO, with suppliers to make sure that we know where we’re at, and we’ve just got to make sure that we continue to push forward in that regard until we get out to Mexico.”

Fernando Alonso wins bid to overturn penalty for incident with Haas | F1 | News, https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1015730/1/explained-how-fia-ruled-fernando-alonso-vs-haas-drama, Alonso had been penalised after finishing seventh in a car that had a loose mirror, which eventually fell off. Lewis Hamilton VS Fernando Alonso - THE RIVALRY! | F1 2022 Video of Lewis Hamilton VS Fernando Alonso - THE RIVALRY! But the FIA have now ruled in Alpine’s favour so Alonso will retain the six points he scored in Austin. Alonso enters the F1 Mexico City Grand Prix ninth in the F1 standings., Alonso had been penalised after finishing seventh in a car that had a loose mirror, which eventually fell off. Haas lodged a complaint at the veteran Spaniard on the grounds that he was driving unsafely. Lewis Hamilton VS Fernando Alonso - THE RIVALRY! | F1 2022 Video of Lewis Hamilton VS Fernando Alonso - THE RIVALRY! | F1 2022 Haas’ complaint was lodged outside of the allotted time but was upheld by the FIA anyway. Alpine then requested a right to review the FIA stewards’ decision. But the FIA have now ruled in Alpine’s favour so Alonso will retain the six points he scored in Austin. Alonso had warned ahead of the ruling: "It will open a huge problem for the future in F1. I think 50, 60, 70 per cent of the cars will have to retire the car when they have an aerodynamic device that is not properly fixed because it’s going to be unsafe, the car. “If 20 minutes too late is okay to protest, is one month too late? Is one hour too late? Is 10 years too late? When is too late? So as I said, this is a very important day for our sport. I don’t care about seventh, you know? I’m not fighting for the world championship. but if this goes ahead, I think we don’t want to open that box.” Alonso had earlier been in a 180mph crash with Lance Stroll - his future teammate when they line up together in the F1 2023 driver line-up. Alonso was lifted into the air and crashed back down - he rejoined last, before a brilliant drive took him into the points. Alonso enters the F1 Mexico City Grand Prix ninth in the F1 standings.
Alonso’s US Grand Prix penalty overturned after Alpine appeal, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.alonsos-us-grand-prix-penalty-overturned-after-alpine-appeal.S3CO2xledwNu0oYCDgbGW.html, Fernando Alonso’s penalty in last weekend’s United States Grand Prix has been overturned after Alpine succeeded in their bid to have the Haas protest that led to it dismissed. On Sunday night in Austin, Haas lodged a protest on the grounds that Alonso – who took the flag in seventh place – had finished the race in a car in an unsafe condition, following his high-speed collision with Lance Stroll’s Aston Martin. Alonso was given a 30-second post-race penalty, which meant the two-time champion was demoted to 15th place in the classified results, losing him six world championship points. However, Alpine then asked for a right of review in light of new evidence and a further hearing on Thursday evening ultimately resulted in Haas’s original protest being deemed inadmissible as it was adjudged the team could have submitted it within the required time limits. It means Alonso’s seventh place and six points from Austin will be reinstated., Fernando Alonso’s penalty in last weekend’s United States Grand Prix has been overturned after Alpine succeeded in their bid to have the Haas protest that led to it dismissed.

Hamilton won’t set limit on F1 career as he plans multi-year Mercedes deal, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/lewis-hamilton-f1-mercedes-career-multi-year-deal/10391297/, Listen to this articleSeven-time F1 world champion Hamilton revealed in an interview with select media including Motorsport.com in Austin that he plans to sign a new F1 contract in the next couple of months. Hamilton’s existing Mercedes F1 contract expires at the end of the 2023 season, but he made clear that he is looking to continue beyond that point as he goes in search of a record-breaking eighth world title. Asked on Thursday in Mexico how much longer he expected to stay in F1, Hamilton replied: “I’m not putting a limit on it, to be honest. “I’m planning to do a multi-year deal with my team. I really, really don’t know what the next five years [hold], I think we’re still trying to work on that., Listen to this article Seven-time F1 world champion Hamilton revealed in an interview with select media including Motorsport.com in Austin that he plans to sign a new F1 contract in the next couple of months.

Asked on Thursday in Mexico how much longer he expected to stay in F1, Hamilton replied: “I’m not putting a limit on it, to be honest. “I’m planning to do a multi-year deal with my team. I really, really don’t know what the next five years [hold], I think we’re still trying to work on that. “There’s a lot of great things that are being put in place, like I’ve just launched a [film] production company this week. But I feel great, like in mind and body. “I think there’s more stuff to achieve together. I just don’t know [how long].” Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes W13 Photo by: Erik Junius Hamilton joked that if former teammate and rival Fernando Alonso left F1 then “maybe I’ll think about it twice, because I’ll be the oldest driver then!” At 37, Hamilton has shown few signs of slowing down in recent times, even through a difficult campaign that has seen Mercedes struggle to challenge pace-setters Red Bull and Ferrari. Hamilton has three races left this year to avoid the first winless campaign of his F1 career, having tied Michael Schumacher’s record for 15 seasons with a victory in 2021. Hamilton felt it was “difficult to say” how this year’s struggles with Mercedes had impacted his motivation but made clear his passion and determination to turn things around remained as strong as ever. “Each year you have to ask yourself what you’re willing to give, [to] give as much if not more than when you first started,” said Hamilton. “Are you willing to give up all your time to prepare and train and work with the team and deliver? If there’s ever a moment that I’m arriving and I’m just coasting along, that’s when, firstly, I don’t belong here and I don’t deserve a position here, and when I should stop. “I question myself whether I’m able to do that and whether I want to do that, and the answer is yes. “We obviously have a championship that we need to get back, and I love the mission and that challenge with my team.” Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes W13 Photo by: Erik Junius Hamilton and Mercedes have worked hard through the season to try and understand the issues they faced with the W13 car, particularly the bouncing problem it faced in the early part of the year. The team’s developments have helped bring it closer to the front, allowing Hamilton to come within seven laps of victory last weekend in Austin, only to lose out to Max Verstappen in the closing stages. Hamilton credited the work that everyone at Mercedes had put in this year, saying it was “beautiful to see the journey that everyone individually” has gone on as well as collectively as a team. “We’ve gelled together, pooled together, pulled up closer to each other, been more open and, with a room really full of men more often, them showing more of their vulnerability,” he said. “That’s been a really interesting process, and I’m grateful to be a part of it. I can’t wait for the time that we get back to success, that we finally get that win and we get that championship. “It’s going to make all these tough moments worthwhile.”

Mark Hughes: How Mexico quirks changed F1's lead fight, https://the-race.com/formula-1/mark-hughes-how-mexico-quirks-changed-f1s-lead-fight/, The Red Bull is a great all-round combination of low drag, good power and consistent downforce throughout all ride heights. The Ferrari has great downforce, is somewhere between Red Bull and Mercedes in drag, and usually has a low-speed acceleration advantage. This was perfect for bringing the Red Bull into its sweet spot, less good for Mercedes and even worse for the already oversteery Ferrari. It may well have been Verstappen’s pole even without the Russell mistake, as the Red Bull had consistently been the quickest through the final sector. In the end, the best all-round combination of car traits and driving secured Verstappen the pole., Mexico City’s extreme altitude always tends to contribute to some interesting performance dynamics between the cars. When the air is 25% less dense than at sea level, the difference between a Formula 1 car which is normally draggy and one which is not is far less than usual. For the same reason, the reduction in downforce means that every extra increment that is produced is extra valuable. That goes a very long way to explaining why the high-downforce but draggy Mercedes – a car which was almost 0.6 seconds off the pace at Austin last week – was bang on the pace here and only a better final lap by Max Verstappen secured the Red Bull pole from George Russell’s Mercedes. Here it was Ferrari which was nowhere, fifth and seventh and 0.6s off the pace. For reasons largely unconnected to the aerodynamics, the altitude is also why the Ferrari isn’t at its best here, as suggested by Carlos Sainz: “We lose a lot of performance in high altitude,” he said, “but I think it’s a one-off. Altitude for this engine is not exactly how we’d want it. We knew before coming here we were going to need to take some compromises.” He’s referring to the Ferrari’s unique intake and turbo configuration. With super-long inlet tracts (which increase the turbulence and flammability of the inlet charge), a lower-revving MGU-H and a smaller turbo (which takes less electrical energy than the others to spin up quickly), it usually has a significant acceleration advantage out of the corners, even if at the expense of earlier clipping at the end of the straights. With Mexico’s 25% reduction in the density of the air, this advantage disappears. A bigger turbo is ideally needed. Leclerc: ‘Nightmare’ race if strange engine issue not solved Read more The Ferrari’s front-loaded power delivery (at normal altitudes) is even part of its handling strengths in low-speed corners. Take a look at any Charles Leclerc telemetry from this year and it can be seen just how much he overlaps the throttle and brakes into the slower corners, using this to spool up the turbo. It’s an incredibly intricate style and one that Sainz has come to emulate through the season. It has implications on the set-up of the car, requiring a strong front end. So there are the basic traits of the three top cars – and how their strengths and weaknesses are changed by Mexico City’s unique challenges. The Red Bull is a great all-round combination of low drag, good power and consistent downforce throughout all ride heights. The Mercedes is draggy but has very good downforce if it can be run low enough – but tricky slow-speed handling because of the compromise made necessary by its rear suspension in combining low- and high-speed corner performance. The Ferrari has great downforce, is somewhere between Red Bull and Mercedes in drag, and usually has a low-speed acceleration advantage. But not here. Now factor-in the particular circumstances of the day. The teams were unusually reliant on FP3 because of Friday’s 2023 Pirelli test in FP2. The track temperature this morning was around 39C. But it takes only a little sun to send the track temperatures soaring at this altitude and by the time qualifying began it was up to 50C. As Russell pointed out, that not only lowers overall grip, “but it also changes the limitation from the front to the rear of the car”. In FP3 the Red Bull was struggling for a front end and the Mercedes was in a very happy place, with Russell and Hamilton heading the times 0.4s clear of Verstappen and 0.7s clear of the Ferraris. But around a track 11C hotter, the balance limitation switches to the rear as the rear rubber quickly overheats. This was perfect for bringing the Red Bull into its sweet spot, less good for Mercedes and even worse for the already oversteery Ferrari. The problems that made Perez’s home qualifying a ‘total mess’ Read more But even then, the Mercedes was still fully competitive with the Red Bull, essentially faster in the corners, slower on the straights and about equal over the lap. Both Sergio Perez and Hamilton suffered power unit derating problems (another hazard of this altitude) and with the Ferraris struggling, so the battle for pole distilled down to Verstappen vs Russell, especially after Hamilton had his first Q3 time deleted for track limits. “Arrgh,” screamed Russell in frustration after his last lap got away from him. “Pole was there for the taking.” He was left relying on his first run time, which was 0.304s slower than Verstappen’s final flyer. Fresh out of the car, Russell was convinced he’d lost the lap with an oversteer moment between Turns 4 and 5 and that his later run-wide moment across the kerbs as he entered the stadium was just from trying to make up the time lost in the earlier incident. But a look at the GPS of each lap shows that the quick oversteer snap cost him almost nothing and that through the first part of the Esses (Turns 7-8-9) the Mercedes’ greater downforce had clawed Russell back ahead, with the Red Bull’s greater straightline speed then pulling Verstappen back level on the approach to the stadium section. There was nothing in it between them as Russell then took too much speed into Turn 10 and ran across the exit kerb. It may well have been Verstappen’s pole even without the Russell mistake, as the Red Bull had consistently been the quickest through the final sector. But Russell was not mistaken in feeling that pole had been possible. In the end, the best all-round combination of car traits and driving secured Verstappen the pole.
Is Red Bull's 'relic of Cold War' F1 windtunnel claim valid?, https://the-race.com/formula-1/is-red-bulls-relic-of-cold-war-f1-windtunnel-claim-valid/, Red Bull team boss Christian Horner believes its aerodynamic testing penalty for breaching the Formula 1 cost cap is “hugely draconian” because its “relic of the Cold War” windtunnel has inefficiencies. Is Red Bull’s F1 cost cap penalty adequate? When Red Bull was in discussions with the FIA over entering the Accepted Breach Agreement that enabled the penalty announced on Friday, Red Bull technical chief Adrian Newey was involved to argue its case. It underwent significant refurbishment at the start of the 21st century having initially been used by Arrows and then Jaguar, the team Red Bull bought. GARY ANDERSONI’m not so sure that the Red Bull windtunnel in Bedford is as bad as Christian Horner suggests., Red Bull team boss Christian Horner believes its aerodynamic testing penalty for breaching the Formula 1 cost cap is “hugely draconian” because its “relic of the Cold War” windtunnel has inefficiencies. As the 2022 constructors’ world champion, Red Bull was already set to have the lowest allowance of windtunnel and CFD time in 2023. Is Red Bull’s F1 cost cap penalty adequate? Our verdict Read more But its punishment for breaking F1’s cost cap in 2021 includes a 10% reduction from the limit it is entitled to next year, which includes a cut in the number of windtunnel hours and runs. Although Red Bull’s rivals and critics believe the team has got off easy with that punishment, Horner believes it will have a significant impact and claimed it could be worth up to half a second in laptime. When Red Bull was in discussions with the FIA over entering the Accepted Breach Agreement that enabled the penalty announced on Friday, Red Bull technical chief Adrian Newey was involved to argue its case. “Adrian is better placed than any of us to describe the draconian-ness of that [an aerodynamic testing penalty],” said Horner. “And you have to remember that we operate out of a windtunnel that is actually a listed building, it’s a relic of the Cold War. It’s not a state-of-the-art windtunnel that our competitors enjoy. “It was built in the 1950s and it has its own limitations when it’s either too cold or too hot at getting the conditions and the operating temperature at that tunnel to the right temperature. “So therefore, a penalty like this is hugely draconian. “And Adrian, I wanted to make sure, had the ability to explain to ensure that our side of the penalty in this discussion through the ABA process was presented accurately.” Red Bull’s windtunnel is based at an old RAE Bedford research facility away from its Milton Keynes campus. It underwent significant refurbishment at the start of the 21st century having initially been used by Arrows and then Jaguar, the team Red Bull bought. Why unapologetic Red Bull went for cost cap ‘plea bargain’ Read more The tunnel is of good quality and is certainly fit for purpose. It is not as though Red Bull is working with substantially outdated technology. But one of the known problems with the tunnel is that it is not as efficient as newer models at getting up to the maximum wind speed that makes for the most reliable measurements. Some of the time taken to reach this speed is calculated within the testing limitations, which means Red Bull can waste some of its time not gaining useful data. The upshot is Horner claims that its penalty “gives an advantage to our competitors, which is why they were pushing so hard for a draconian penalty”. “And we’re going to have to work incredibly hard with the time that we have available,” he said. “We’re going to have to be efficient with our time, we’re going to have to be efficient with the runs that we choose to do in our windtunnel. The 13 ways Red Bull got its cost cap calculation wrong Read more “I have full belief in our team and the capability of our team, I think they’ve demonstrated that time and time again. “There were other sporting penalties that were available to the FIA. “This one was obviously lobbied hard for by our competitors, because they felt it hit us the hardest.” Rivals are unlikely to have any sympathy for Red Bull, though. An inefficient windtunnel may well mean it feels this kind of penalty more harshly than others might. But ultimately the quality of a team’s equipment has no bearing on what any sporting penalty should be. GARY ANDERSON I’m not so sure that the Red Bull windtunnel in Bedford is as bad as Christian Horner suggests. And with the situation Red Bull has found itself in I would expect nothing else from him but crying wolf (no pun intended) about how basic the team’s equipment is and how hard-done-by it is. I looked at it in my time with Jaguar and thought that if it was brought up to date as far as the rolling road and data acquisition was concerned that it would be a decent tunnel. What Red Bull aero testing penalty really is, and how it’ll hurt Read more Yes, it is a big old beast, but because of that it is very stable and the temperature doesn’t run away with itself over long data acquisition runs as it does in some modern tunnels. When I looked at it, my main problem was that the working section was a bit small width-wise. When we had huge outwash car characteristics, which in effect makes the car wider, the walls were a bit too close. So, I think with these new aerodynamic rules reducing that outwash it has actually played into Red Bull’s hands.
Verstappen beats Mercedes pair to Mexican GP pole, https://the-race.com/formula-1/verstappen-beats-mercedes-pair-to-mexican-gp-pole/, Formula 1 world champion Max Verstappen stayed safely clear of a surprise Mercedes challenge to take pole for the Mexican Grand Prix. Mercedes had been 1-2 in final practice then topped both Q1 and Q2 with Lewis Hamilton. Q2 had been extraordinarily close – just 0.063 seconds covering the top five – but Verstappen raised the bar in Q3. Bottas’s position wasn’t just down to Ferrari underperformance – he’d been a brilliant fourth in Q1 and sixth in Q2 too. Aston Martin had struggled all day and couldn’t get either car beyond Q1, qualifying ahead of only the two Williams., Formula 1 world champion Max Verstappen stayed safely clear of a surprise Mercedes challenge to take pole for the Mexican Grand Prix. Mercedes had been 1-2 in final practice then topped both Q1 and Q2 with Lewis Hamilton. Q2 had been extraordinarily close – just 0.063 seconds covering the top five – but Verstappen raised the bar in Q3. He was helped by the final segment being a messy one for Mercedes. Hamilton had his first flying lap, which was only good for third at that point anyway, deleted for a track limits breach, while George Russell made an error on his last lap. Q1: P1 Q2: P1 Q3: P10 (so far) Hamilton loses his first Q3 time for missing the apex at Turn 2#MexicoGP #F1 pic.twitter.com/6465pxXeys — Formula 1 (@F1) October 29, 2022 That meant Verstappen’s 1m17.775s for Red Bull gave him pole by 0.304s over Russell and 0.309s over Hamilton. Home hero Sergio Perez wasn’t a pole threat and starts fourth. Ferrari struggled throughout, with Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc only fifth and seventh, split by Valtteri Bottas’s Alfa Romeo. Bottas’s position wasn’t just down to Ferrari underperformance – he’d been a brilliant fourth in Q1 and sixth in Q2 too. Lando Norris’s McLaren and the Alpines of Fernando Alonso and Esteban Ocon completed the top 10. Daniel Ricciardo was just 0.053s shy of joining McLaren team-mate Norris in Q3 as he qualified 11th ahead of Zhou Guanyu – who couldn’t match team-mate Bottas’s heroics – and the AlphaTauris. Mick Schumacher had a lap comfortably good enough for Q2 deleted over a track limits infringement, though he’ll still start 15th when Haas team-mate Kevin Magnussen’s five-place penalty for engine component changes is applied. Aston Martin had struggled all day and couldn’t get either car beyond Q1, qualifying ahead of only the two Williams. Qualifying Results
Fresh twist in Alpine-Haas case despite inadmissible protest, https://the-race.com/formula-1/fresh-twist-in-alpine-haas-case-despite-inadmissible-protest/, However, Alpine continues to persevere with the matter and has now lodged a ‘right of review’ into the original Haas protest being deemed admissible instead. He was punished after a protest was lodged by Haas regarding Alonso’s right wing mirror falling off. In addition, Alpine lodged its own protest outside the time limit for the decision on the original protest. The stewards said that there is no ability or right to protest a decision or a summons to a hearing. So, while the Alpine protest will not go to a full hearing, Alpine and Haas have already been summoned once more to a hearing at 8.45pm local time on Thursday., FIA stewards have rejected Alpine’s protest regarding the admissibility of a separate protest from Haas that led to Fernando Alonso losing his points finish in the United States Grand Prix. However, Alpine continues to persevere with the matter and has now lodged a ‘right of review’ into the original Haas protest being deemed admissible instead. A post-race penalty dropped Alonso from seventh to 15th, costing him the points he had earned by recovering from an accident in which he went airborne and hit the wall. He was punished after a protest was lodged by Haas regarding Alonso’s right wing mirror falling off. The stewards ruled that the Alpine had been driven in an unsafe condition and hit Alonso with a 30-second penalty in lieu of a 10-second stop-and-go penalty. This was despite criticising race control for not acting during the grand prix, having been made aware of the mirror problem. Alpine was left disappointed by the decision but could not challenge it directly because F1’s rules do not allow time penalties to be appealed. Instead, Alpine effectively launched a counter-protest against Haas’s original protest, claiming it should not have been accepted as it was lodged 24 minutes past the usual 30-minute deadline. As part of this, Alpine said it was not impossible for Haas to have lodged the protest within the 30-minute period and even cited the Oxford dictionary’s definition of impossible as something that “cannot happen or be achieved” and referred to it as a “very high bar”. But the stewards were already aware of that when they accepted it in the first place using their discretionary power. Gary Anderson: F1 should have more penalties like Alonso’s Read more And the reason for this was that Haas had sought clarification from race control and been explicitly told it had one hour to lodge its protest. In addition, Alpine lodged its own protest outside the time limit for the decision on the original protest. This was revealed in the findings published by the stewards following a video conference at 6pm local time in Mexico, in which they determined Alpine’s protest was not admissible. The stewards said that there is no ability or right to protest a decision or a summons to a hearing. They said that Alpine should have appealed to the FIA International Court of Appeal instead – or, petition the stewards for a review of the original decision. As this remains available for 14 days after the end of the competition in question, Alpine has opted to do exactly that. So, while the Alpine protest will not go to a full hearing, Alpine and Haas have already been summoned once more to a hearing at 8.45pm local time on Thursday. Two reasons Alonso’s so confident he’ll get US GP points back Read more This is to determine if a significant and relevant new element has been discovered which was not available to Alpine at the time of the decision taken to find the Haas protest admissible. Alonso previously called F1’s “direction” into question by claiming this would be “an important day” for the championship. He then said on Thursday: “I’m very optimistic that we will keep seventh place. “I fully trust what they will decide. I think there are a couple of things that are very clear, that they were made wrong from their side. “If I’m not seventh at the end, I’m sure they will explain why and we will see it clearly.”
Big day arrives for Aussie gun on ‘Piastri path’; ray of hope for ‘helpless’ Ricciardo: F1 Burning Qs, https://www.foxsports.com.au/motorsport/formula-one/aussie-son-of-legend-gets-first-f1-crack-mercedes-risks-protest-with-latest-upgrade-mexico-burning-questions/news-story/04200f23510b695a2090e3ab5b9a004e, That would of course depend on Daniel Ricciardo making a comeback, but with every poor race, that goal gets slightly further away. If Red Bull Racing has the dominant car, which driver will wield it — or be allowed to wield it — best? Doohan, son of five-time motorcycling champion Mick, will get behind the wheel of an Alpine for the first hour of practice for the Mexico City Grand Prix, and he’ll do so again at the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. The United States Grand Prix was his 13th victory of the season, tying him Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel for the most wins in a single campaign. It’ll sure take some climbing after his United States Grand Prix performance., The titles have been decided and the pressure’s off — or so you might think. Max Verstappen and Red Bull Racing have dominated the 2022 season to wrap up both championships, but in the final three races of the season there are still some crucial questions still without answers. Some of the questions are being freshly asked. Watch every practice, qualifying and race of the 2022 FIA Formula One World Championship™ live on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now > One of the first to be posed this weekend will come 5am (AEDT) on Saturday, when Jack Doohan gets his first spin on an F1 race weekend with Alpine. Doohan’s rise through the junior ranks has been quiet and understated, but he’s now on the path towards F1, teasing the glimpse of a future in which Australia could have up to three drivers on the grid. That would of course depend on Daniel Ricciardo making a comeback, but with every poor race, that goal gets slightly further away. He’ll need to put last weekend’s shocker behind him and regroup for Mexico to get even his backup plans back on track. And on track is where this weekend’s biggest questions are. If Red Bull Racing has the dominant car, which driver will wield it — or be allowed to wield it — best? Will it be Max Verstappen in pursuit of a new record or Sergio Perez shooting for a first-ever Mexican home win? That’s assuming the RB18 has things all its own way. After a close — well, close-ish — call in Austin, Mercedes will have its full upgrade package on tap in Mexico and be fully equipped with hope that its best chance to win a race this season isn’t behind it. The titles may have been decided, but there’s plenty still to watch for. WHAT WILL DOOHAN MAKE OF HIS FIRST CHANCE? The weekend will open with a potentially crucial day for Australians in Formula 1, with Jack Doohan getting his first crack at modern-day F1 machinery on an F1 weekend. Doohan, son of five-time motorcycling champion Mick, will get behind the wheel of an Alpine for the first hour of practice for the Mexico City Grand Prix, and he’ll do so again at the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. The 19-year-old is effectively Oscar Piastri’s replacement in the Alpine program since the Melburnian defected to McLaren for next season. Doohan is following in Piastri’s footsteps, albeit Alpine will hope without the controversial promotion to Formula 1. Max claims US Grand Prix, RB win CC | 03:10 Doohan’s three wins in his first full-time Formula 2 season, in which he’s currently fourth in the standings, are a big part of why he’s received the call-up, as have been his three private tests in a year-old Alpine, giving the team the confidence to put him into the pressure cooker of a grand prix weekend. “To be actually driving this year’s current Formula 1 car but also on the same track and at the same time as the current Formula 1 drivers on a Formula 1 weekend is going to be unbelievable,” Doohan said. “It’s something that I’ve dreamt of since I was a kid. “We had some good time in the sim in which I was able to work the engineers to kind of get my head around it. It’s quite an extraordinary circuit and place, so it’s going to be an experience and not only for a new track but to experience [high-altitude, high-speed] conditions like these, but nevertheless I’m super excited.” A big part Doohan’s experience in Mexico will be the chance to sit in with the team over the course of the weekend rather than jumping in and out between Formula 2 sessions, as he’ll have to do in Abu Dhabi, when the junior series is also on track. The Aussie intends to make the most of the chance to try to embed himself into Alpine. “I’ve been overlooking the Formula 1 weekend from afar over my Formula 2 season so far, being able to come up into the paddock at certain points, but actually being able to be full-time in the Formula 1 paddock and be with the engineers through every moment of the weekend will enable me to really understand the step-by-step moments that are required to fully be ready for these sessions and for participation in the session,” he said. “Ultimately the aim is to be doing this every week, and this experience is another step closer to achieving that goal. “I’ll work hard on the day, do everything the team sets out and at the same time enjoy the moment, as I know it’s going to be a unique opportunity.” It’s always hard to judge success in rookie FP1 outings given they must balance acclimatisation while also contributing something to the team’s weekend run plan. It’s also completely up to the team whether to give a driver a glory run on low fuel — perhaps unlikely given this is Doohan’s first F1 weekend appearance. Mick and Jack Doohan Source: Supplied But continuing on his trajectory for now is enough to tick the boxes. “We have all been impressed with Jack’s progression across many areas this season and he’s deserving of this chance as we continue to nurture his high potential,” principal Otmar Szafnauer said. “We expect Jack to work hard during the session and take as much as he can from the experience of being involved in a Formula 1 grand prix weekend.” Also in action this weekend in FP1 will be Nyck de Vries for Mercedes, Kiwi Liam Lawson for AlphaTauri and Pietro Fittipaldi for Haas. VERSTAPPEN’S RECORD OR PEREZ’S PRIDE? With both championships decided, Red Bull Racing is out to have fun in the final three races, and with the fastest car on the grid, it’s sure to enjoy itself. That’s not to say there’s nothing on the line between now and mid-November. Max Verstappen stands on the precipice of history. The United States Grand Prix was his 13th victory of the season, tying him Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel for the most wins in a single campaign. No driver has ever won 14 in a single year, but Verstappen now has three shots at setting a new benchmark. Obviously Verstappen has the advantage of the equal longest season in F1 history, with three more races than Vettel had in 2013 and 14 more than Schumacher in 2004. But Verstappen also has a chance to put himself near the top of the order in percentage terms too. He’s guaranteed to be top 10 in terms of percentage victories in a season, but winning all three remaining races would put him a clear second behind only Alberto Ascari, who won six of the eight races in 1952. There’d be no denying such an achievement. But targeting 16 wins puts him in direct competition with what ought to be Red Bull Racing’s other great aim for the season: getting Sergio Perez a home victory this weekend. Sainz spins out on lap one! | 00:32 It might sound unduly sentimental, but with Perez having been called to play the team game — in particular early in the season, when he was still very much a contender and had days on which he was quicker than Verstappen — facilitating him to a victory before the always enthusiastic Mexican crowd would not only keep him sweet but earn the team some very good publicity at a time it could really use it. Perez of course has to go out and get it — the team isn’t going to go out of its way to hand it to him — but the Mexican is showing signs of improved form since his mid-season slump, with a win and a second place in his last three grands prix and a fourth place despite an engine penalty last time out in Texas. The team may well not be forced into a decision, but if circumstance were to create such a scenario, which way the team falls would be fascinating. WILL ANYONE PROTEST MERCEDES? Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez is one of the calendar’s most extreme circuits. The layout itself is relatively uneventful, but what makes it such a challenge is the elevation. Mexico City is 2.2 kilometres above sea level, where the air is around 22 per cent less dense — a problematic amount. While turbochargers mean there’s no real power loss, there is a significant cooling deficit which can force teams to reduce power just to survive the race distance. The same goes for cooling, with brakes always running hot. There’s a commensurate effect on aerodynamics. Typically teams bring their highest downforce bodywork to Mexico City to try to scavenge as much performance as possible, but the thinness of the atmosphere means they still generate only as much downforce as they do in Monza. Which is where we come to the interesting question of Mercedes. This year the car has tended to be run in a higher downforce configuration just to try to make the overall concept work, which in turn has left it massively down on straight-line speed owing to drag. But if drag isn’t a problem in Mexico, will the W13 still be so disadvantaged? The other potential strong point for Mercedes will be the smoothness of this track, being still a relatively new construction. That will allow the car to run lower to the ground, closer to its optimum ride height. MORE MOTORSPORT CONFIRMED: Audi is buying Sauber. Here’s why — and what it means for F1 GOLD COAST 500: SVG’s double title chance on street track’s return ‘I’M STILL HERE’: How Hamilton proved F1 doubters wrong and delivered a statement for 2023 And that brings us to the team’s final major upgrade of the year, which was partially bolted on in the United States but which will be finalised this weekend with a front wing that carries some legality concerns. The potential problem surrounds the slot gap separators — the bits that keep the front wing elements apart at high speed — and whether they’re primarily designed for an aerodynamic benefit rather than for structural reasons. Mercedes has had it ticked off by the FIA already, but it’s ultimately up to the stewards to decide if a protest is lodged. The team says it’s worth a relatively small amount in terms of lap time, but with the W13 sporadically on the pace, a small difference might be enough to put Mercedes back within striking distance of victory in the right circumstances. CAN RICCIARDO TURN IT AROUND? Three races left for Daniel Ricciardo to end his McLaren career on a positive note. It’ll sure take some climbing after his United States Grand Prix performance. His 16th-place finish in Texas, last of all but Nicholas Latifi, was the comfortably his worst result of the year. While he finished 18th in Imola and 17th in the Netherlands, the former was marred by his first-lap crash and the latter was down to a poor qualifying result at a track where overtaking is tough. In Austin he slid backwards from the grid, and it was all he could do to get past the severely hamstrung Latifi in the slowest car on the grid. Teammate Lando Norris, meanwhile, scored points with sixth. “I’m choosing to laugh because I don’t really want to cry,” Ricciardo said on Sunday night. “It’s one of those ones where — it’s happened all too often this year — early in the race, by lap eight, lap 10, I know how the rest of the day is going to go. “You can just feel and also see what the other cars around can do — and simply what I’m not able to. If I knew [how to], the year would be going better.” Alonso goes airborne in chaotic crash | 01:12 We all know by now that Ricciardo’s struggles aren’t going to suddenly resolve themselves, but he might at least take a little bit of hope from the fact that he’s a podium-getter and pole-sitter in Mexico, albeit in different machinery. “I still am going to do what I can in the last three [races],” he said, though he added, “I’m at a point where I’m not going to hope or think or expect it’s going to be an amazing last three races. “Days like [Austin] leave you feeling a bit helpless.” The rumour is that Ricciardo is close to, or perhaps has already done, a deal for next season, probably in a reserve driver role and likely with Mercedes — a good thing, if that’s what he wants, given the effect a few more performances like that in Texas could have on his already bruised reputation.
Why Checo fever will make this year’s Mexico City Grand Prix unmissable, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.why-checo-fever-will-make-this-years-mexico-city-grand-prix-unmissable.6cvrDVcESmmSk9KoZ6t07S.html, Driving from the airport to our hotel on arrival in Mexico City, I saw a staggering 22 billboards featuring home hero Sergio Perez’s face advertising an array of products. Verstappen won the race last year - and Red Bull look well placed to repeat that featMexico City is the highest event on the calendar at 2,220m above sea level.

Mexico always delivers one of the most eye-catching races of the year, in more ways than one, Driving from the airport to our hotel on arrival in Mexico City, I saw a staggering 22 billboards featuring home hero Sergio Perez’s face advertising an array of products. The Red Bull driver is big time in his home country, and you’ll struggle to find a soul who doesn’t want to see him upgrade his third-place last year to victory this time around. Fortunately for his loyal faithful, Perez arrives in Mexico not only with a car that has just won Red Bull their first constructors’ championship in close to a decade but with some impressive momentum to boot, having won Singapore, finished second in Japan and crossed the line fourth in Austin. I sat down with him for an extended interview that will run on Sunday in F1 TV’s Pre-Race Show and the overwhelming takeaway is that Checo is a man oozing with confidence, loving life at a top team and absolutely convinced that he can fight for the world championship – and by default beat Max Verstappen – next season. It’s a huge ask, of course, but it’s clear he’s in a much better place mentally after an up-and-down mid-season, where the development of the car moved away from his style. READ MORE: Checo-mania and Verstappen chasing a record – 5 storylines we’re excited about ahead of the Mexico City GP Before 2023, his focus will be on Sunday and delighting what is expected to be a 350,000-strong weekend crowd – many of whom will pack into the former Foro Sol Baseball Stadium to create a cacophony of noise and explosion of colour in what is one of Formula 1’s most spine-tingling atmospheres. Perez arrives here chasing a first win on home soil The track is cool, too, as I found out when our new analyst and experienced IndyCar racer James Hinchcliffe took me for a spin in a buggy around the 4.304km Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez (also for a feature on F1 TV’s Pre-Race Show). The run from pole position to the braking zone is the longest on the calendar at 811m, making for a spicy first corner on the opening lap of the race. Very quickly come the Esses – a five-corner sequence that is as thrilling and daunting as Suzuka’s Esses, the Circuit of The Americas Sector 1 sequence and Silverstone’s epic Maggotts-Becketts-Chapel run. READ MORE: Perez ‘super proud’ that Mexico City GP will continue to 2025 as he aims to win home race And before you know it, you’re in the Stadium section, that features four turns – including the tricky Turn 13 where you’ll often see brake discs glowing. That’s just one piece of evidence to show how tough this circuit is on braking, largely because of the high altitude. Verstappen won the race last year - and Red Bull look well placed to repeat that feat Mexico City is the highest event on the calendar at 2,220m above sea level. That means the air in thinner, which in turn means there’s less molecules to transport less energy away from hot systems like the power unit and the brakes. As a result, cooling is a big challenge, and you’ll see different bodywork – specific for this race – in place to cope with the conditions. Honda have traditionally delivered a very efficient power unit – and that remains the case this year. While the others have caught up, it's clear that the Honda-Red Bull unit will be a formidable package around here. READ MORE: Sainz predicting ‘six-way’ fight for Mexico win, as Leclerc tips Red Bull as favourites Ferrari, though, should still be a force in qualifying – as they have been all year. Their challenge is to wrestle control of their degradation on Sunday, an issue that has impacted them all year and is unlikely to be cured in the final three races.

FIA Thursday press conference - Mexico City, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.fia-thursday-press-conference-mexico-city-2022.20QzI6krVpNeZESrUFHF0j.html, But yeah, I'm just enjoying it. I think I'm very optimistic that we will keep seventh place. So yeah, I'm sure we won't give any margin on track but I'm looking forward to it. CL: It’s a difficult question to answer but overall I feel like we've had some very good races and some other races where we've been struggling a lot . So you know, I'm happy to be here., DRIVER GROUP 1: Sergio PÉREZ (Red Bull), Charles LECLERC (Ferrari), Mick SCHUMACHER (Haas), Zhou GUANYU (Alfa Romeo), Fernando ALONSO (Alpine) Q: I think we have to start with the local hero. Sergio, great to see you racing at home. Can we start with what happened early on this week in Guadalajara, where you lit up the city with a show car run. Just tell us about it? Sergio PÉREZ: Yeah, it was a super special moment for me, to be able to drive your own car in your own streets, you know, at home. It was a super day and we did it before I started in F1 but this was very special for the people. Everyone was so emotional about it, so it was a massive day for me. Q: How many people turned up to watch? SP: It was like 140,000, which for Mexico is not that much! But still, it was a very emotional day. Q: And they’ve added more grandstands here at the track. Just how energising do you find the fans? SP: They are super. They give it all on the grandstands. It's rare to see it, you know, because all around the world, in other places, of course, I see a few Mexican flags all around the world but what I get to experience in Austin and here, it's something super, super special for me. Q: And for a few more years as well. Can we just get your reaction to the news that Formula 1 will continue racing here in Mexico City until 2025. SP: This is something great for our country, because this country, we get to show how good that Mexicans are, our Mexican people, our country. So I think Formula 1 gives you that exposure worldwide, so I'm super proud of my country, that we are able to secure another contract with Formula 1. So yeah, super happy for that. Q: And a quick word on the race. You were on the podium here last year. Have you dared to dream about taking the win on Sunday? SP: Yeah, I've dreamt a few times already about it. And it will be massive for me. Obviously, that's the target for Sunday. It will not be easy. We need to be perfect throughout the weekend. So yeah, I think all the focus will be now on the racing stuff, to try to maximise a weekend. And yeah, at the end of the day, it's another weekend with the same amount of points – but it's the most special one for me. Q: Charles, Sunday's race is going to be your 100th Grand Prix. How would you sum up your journey in Formula 1 so far? Charles LECLERC: Well, it went by very, very quickly. Yeah, it's obviously a special milestone and I hope we can achieve a special result for that. I remember like yesterday when I first arrived in F1, in Australia with Alfa Romeo. And it was a very special moment, a dream come true. And then obviously, already from the second year, I was lucky enough to be chosen as a Ferrari driver. And again, that was another dream come true. I still have many dreams, which obviously one of them is to become a World Champion and I hope this will become reality as soon as possible. We are all working towards that goal. But yeah, I'm just enjoying it. And I'm really, really lucky to be in that position. Q: What about Sunday, then? What can you do here? CL: Difficult to know for now. I still believe that Red Bull will be the team to beat on Sunday. They always seem to find something from the Saturday to the Sunday that we didn't quite find it yet. But we are getting there. I don't know whether this track will be better or worse. But anyway, I believe it will be close on Sunday. Q: And of course, it's close between you and the man on your right, Checo Pérez in the Drivers' Championship. Now drivers often say that the only finishing position that counts is first. There's two points between you two. What would it mean for you to finish second? CL: Well, obviously, of course we are, I mean with Ferrari, we are working to win the World Championship, but now we know winning the World Championship is not possible any more, we'll try to use these last three races in order to be a better team for next year, to challenge for the World Championship again. Having said that, second is better than third and we'll give everything to beat Checo. Q: Mick, we'll come to you now. In a way you were a victim of the crash between Lance Stroll and Fernando Alonso on Sunday. How much was your race compromised by accident damage? Mick SCHUMACHER: Yeah, it was unfortunately quite damaged, the car, it affected quite a few different areas on the car, which obviously didn't quite play into our hands, because I think otherwise we were on for a good position in around, I think, P6 or P7 even, so would have been great points for the team having a double points finish. But nonetheless, we know the speed is there. And so hopefully we'll be able to have a bit more luck this weekend. Q: You know the speed is there. Let's talk about car performance. What are its strengths? What are its weaknesses? And do you think it'll work well at this altitude? MS: Yeah, I mean, I don't see a reason why not. I think that our car has been performing well, under the high downforce circumstances that we had across the other tracks up to now, obviously, the high downforce here will perform like a low downforce set-up so it'll be interesting to see and feel how the car behaves. Nonetheless, you know, we're in a tight battle with AlphaTauri. Obviously, we know that Aston Martin and Alfa Romeo aren’t too far away. So, it's just a matter of trying to finish as high as possible and finish with as many points as possible each weekend. So that's really the target right now. Q: Just a final one for me on the second Haas seat for next year. There's so much speculation about it. Just how hard is it for you to keep out all the noise and just concentrate on the job in hand? MS: Well, it's not difficult. I'm here to do my job. And I'm here to do it well. So that's what my main focus is on. And that's everything that I'm in control of. So, I'm just trying to do my best and yeah, that's what I'm here for. Q: Zhou, you were disappointed not to finish in the points in Austin. But what positives can you take out of that weekend? How was the car performing with the upgrades? Zhou GUANYU: Yeah, I mean, it was quite a lot of positive to take. Obviously the end wasn't something we wanted as a team, but let’s say the qualifying performance. Now finally, we were actually able to reach both cars in Q3, but my lap obviously got deleted. And then with the engine penalties, we have to start a bit further down. Always knew it would be a difficult race and somehow I finished P11 after finishing 13th. So yes, somehow I finished P11 after finishing 13th or 14th on track, so I think everything is possible. But for that race, I think we have to maybe work a little bit more on the race pace. But what was quite clear is that one-lap performance. We made a huge step up compared to the last few races, so clearly the upgrade package is working. Q: What about this battle in the Constructors' Championship between yourselves and Aston Martin? Who do you think's got the better race car? ZG: In general, I think we always had a little bit better Quali, and they have a bit more advantage on the race – but still was very difficult to predict every team, how they do – but it's quite true that the last three races from Singapore onwards, they’ve being very competitive, and they've been scoring a massive amount points which put us in a position that you know, one point away. So, that's definitely the key or the target which I do aim for: try to finish the Constructors’ ahead of them. I feel like, with the car we’ve got now, we can do that. It’s just a matter of both drivers putting everything together and fighting for that. Q: This is your first time racing here in Mexico City. Just how excited are you to get on with it? ZG: Yeah, for sure. Looking at the last few years how slippery the track is, so exciting to be driving out there for sure. Another new circuit for me. And yeah, I think it’ll be a cool experience. Looking at the crowds on Sundays it’s going to be quite particular, and from my side, tomorrow is a day of learning, a day of learning the track, learning braking points and all that. So far, I think we have to just get ready for that Saturday, when it’s important. Make sure we don't have the same as mistake we did in Quali on my Q2 lap, so we get the position we want on Sunday’s starting grid, and then we can move forward on that. Q: Fernando, thank you for waiting. Can we start by just throwing it back to last weekend? First of all, I hope there are no ill effects from the crash. How are you feeling? Fernando ALONSO: Good. Thank you. Q: And have you had a chance to talk to Lance Stroll about what happened? What's your verdict on the cause of the accident? FA: Yeah, yeah, we talked already after the race in his garage, and then in the stewards’ room, because we had to go there and yeah, my view is was the same after the race and the same in the stewards’ room, and the same now. I think it was an unlucky moment of the race. We move simultaneously, more or less, to the left. We were very close. I took the slipstream until the last moment. There was no DRS on the first laps after the Safety Car goes in, so I have to take the slipstream very aggressively until the very last moment. I moved to the left, he moved to the left in the same moment more or less protecting and we touched. So I think it was a very unlucky moment. In a way, I think his penalty is very harsh. But it’s the way it is. Q: And what are your thoughts on the post-race protest from Haas? FA: Let's wait until we have the outcome today. Obviously, I was very disappointed. It was a rollercoaster of emotions for me on Sunday: started at the back, then we were like P6, we had the accident; last again; and then finishing P7, and then in the evening, again out of the point. So it was up and down all day long. And now, let's wait and see. I think I'm very optimistic that we will keep seventh place. The FIA has been very transparent to us this year. I think the new leadership, also with Mohammed I think, doing things a little bit differently than in the past. So I fully trust what they will decide. I think there are a couple of things that are very clear, that they were made wrong from their side. So, as I said, I'm very confident that I will be P7 again in Austin. If I'm not P7 at the end, I'm sure they will explain why and we will see it clearly. So, you know, I am very, very relaxed about that. QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR Q: (David Croft – Sky Sports F1) Fernando, great to see that there's no ill effects from last week. Can you give us an indication of your grounds for optimism? For the protest. It's unusual to see a team protesting a stewards’ decision rather than appealing it. And whilst you weren't shown a black and white flag, it is the team's responsibility to ensure the safety of the car. Why do you think in this case, the FIA will reinstate you to seventh place? FA: Yeah, well, first of all, you cannot appeal any decision of time penalty. So that's how the rules are written, which is nice, because whatever decision you take, you cannot appeal. I would love to have that one when driving. But yeah, we protest basically because it was out of time. And there were a couple of things that… the FIA was not showing me the black and orange flag. So, they felt that the car was safe to keep driving. The car went to parc fermé, passed all the scrutineering. Green light on parc fermé, and then the protests arrive too late. So, between all, I think there is no doubt that this was not the right decision to take. And if this is the right decision to take, it will open a huge problem for the future in Formula 1. I think fifty, sixty, seventy per cent of the cars will have to retire the car when they have an aerodynamic device that is not properly fixed because it's going to be unsafe, the car. It will open also… if 20 minutes too late is okay to protest, is one month too late? Is one hour too late? Is 10 years too late? When is too late? So that, I think, we cannot afford. So, as I said, this is a very important day for our sport. I don't care about seventh, I'm not fighting for the World Championship, but if this goes ahead, I think we will open a very… we don't want to open that box. Q: (Jesus Balseiro – Diario AS) Question to Fernando. What would be a good outcome for you for the penalty. What would be the right decision for you? FA: To cancel the protest that has been admitted out of the deadline. Just, it’s simply illegal. Q: (Alex Kalinauckas – Autosport) Another question for Fernando, please. Esteban has said the team measured the impact after you landed after hitting Lance's car at 42-g. How did that feel from your point of view? And also, how did you recover from there for the rest of the race with the adrenaline surging – because it was obviously quite the drive afterwards. Thank you. FA: Well, I didn't speak with a team about that, so I didn’t know that number. It felt not that hard, when I hit the ground, I was just more concerned if I was going to the left to the fence outside the circuit. Obviously the first five minutes when we were running behind the Safety Car, I was concerned that the car was not damaged, you know, somehow because they changed the tyres, the front wing, and apparently there was not damaged when they check on the pitstop. And the car felt good, more or less, behind the Safety Car. So I was amazed, first of all, about that. And then yeah, we were just recovering places up to P7, so it felt very good. It was mentally challenging to go through every lap and make some moves as well. Also, with Kevin at the end, I make a move in the same straight and I brake very late into Turn 12 on the inside, so you always have the accident a little bit in your mind: what could have been. But physically, still young, no problem. Q: (Luke Smith – Autosport) Mick, it’s a question for you about Gary Gannon, your race engineer when you came into F1, working with him, he seemed like a very calming influence over the radio, very good for a rookie. How have you guys worked together over the past couple of years? How much trust have you been able to build up? And yeah, how much do you enjoy working with him as a race engineer? MS: Gary's always been somebody I could always rely on and he's definitely, as you say, a very calm person. But he does, behind the scenes, like to get angry, like to show some emotions. But no, it's been great. And especially as a rookie coming in, you know, he showed me the ways, he showed me what was important and what not, and I think we really managed to build up a really good understanding when it comes to driving our car. And yeah, it's very much that we work together, to go in the same direction to go forwards. Q: (José Antonio Cortés – ESPN) For Checo and Charles. There are only two points between you in the championship. You both are very clean drivers but how difficult could it be to keep that cleanness when you are so close in the track always and are fighting for the P2 in the Championship? SP: I think in general with Charles it has been good, the fighting. It's always, really close, really tight. And you know that Charles will be aggressive, always, but always fair. And it’s something I don't believe he will change, no matter how we get into Abu Dhabi, what difference will it make because he is like that? And I don't see that changing. And I also feel like, from my side, I'm also fair. So I don't expect that to change. CL: No, I don't think it will change. Obviously, if there's an opportunity, I'll go for it. As Checo will go for it. It’s always been the case. Closer we get to the season, less opportunities, you have to make the difference. But we also know that we are fighting each other, so we can take maybe a bit more risks when we fight each other. But that's what makes it exciting. So yeah, I'm sure we won't give any margin on track but I'm looking forward to it. Q: (Alex Kalinauckas – Autosport) Charles, you mentioned after the Austin race how the tyre deg again reared its head for Ferrari. You went from leading Max to about seven seconds behind him. I just wondered how much is that problem down to something the driver could control, or is something that the team needs to fix through car design for next year? CL: It’s a difficult question to answer but overall I feel like we've had some very good races and some other races where we've been struggling a lot . On my side, it's not like you change a lot from track to track, what you do with the tyre degradation. So I think there are races where we've approached it in the right way and we had the car in the right window, the tyres in the right window, but as we often speak, it is a very fine line with not getting the right window, the tyres and then it has a big consequence on your race and that we just need to get to get better as a team in order to always be in that in that window where everything works. Q: (Jonas Hüttel – Ektsra Bladet) For Fernando and Checo, and if anybody else wants to chip in, we've seen the black and orange flag three times this year. And you were talking on your Instagram post about the future direction of F1. When will you as drivers like to see the black and orange flag enforced? FA: Well, when the Race Director feels that the cars are not safe to drive. We inside the car, we don't know sometimes even what damage we have, what aerodynamic devices are, you know, ready to fall behind the next car. So we just rely on the Race Director and we just drive the car as fast as we can. And yeah, we maybe need to use that flag more often, or not, it’s a decision that the FIA and teams they need to check. I think Formula 1 has changed a lot in the last 40, 50 years, there are a lot of aerodynamic devices now they are borderline in the races, so we need to make sure that we have a proper rule on that. And when you see the black and orange flag you have to stop probably and retire the car because I think it's very difficult to fix some of those decisions, maybe the front wing is the easiest one, but apart from that I think it is difficult, but what we cannot allow is, you know, thinking after the race about things, because then you enter, as I said, a wild territory. It’s like penalising a car for an overtaking because there was one car on the gravel or whatever but there was no yellow flag. So he made the overtaking and then a few hours later you said ‘yeah, but he did an overtake and this should be a yellow flag’. Yes, but it was not a yellow flag, so it's, you know, whatever fault of the marshal or the Race Director or whatever it was nothing and the overtake was made. SP: I think Fernando covered it super well, nothing more to add. Q: (Louis Dekker – NOS) For Checo. Max has already told us he will not give victory in the last laps to you if you're in P2. Of course, you can win your home race for the first time. He could win his 14th race of the season. Will you be happy to fight him if necessary in the last laps? SP: Of course I want to win this weekend. This is my target. This is a target for everyone that is sitting here and that is coming to this weekend, also for Max. So yeah, we are all very competitive and we all want to get the victory on Sunday. So we're going to give it all we possibly can to achieve that. Q: (Luke Smith – Autosport) To all five or whoever wants to contribute. We've got the earliest finish to an F1 season in three years this year, without going into December and finishing in November. For you guys and your preparations for next season, how much easier does that make things, giving you a little bit more time, bit more family time as well over the winter and preparing you for the record season of 24 races next year? FA: I'm happy to finish earlier. Generally, it doesn't matter if next year is 24, it was a shorter calendar [this year] I think. Yeah, I think last year we finished very late, in the middle of December or something like that. It was way too close to Christmas. So yeah, I'm happy now with this year. Next year again we will finish later, unfortunately. But yeah, I think everyone has a different plan for winter. But it's good always to have extra time. Q: When does work start with Aston Martin for you? FA: First of January at the factory. Q: Zhou? ZG: Yeah, I mean, he covered pretty much everything. It’s good for us. Obviously, I didn't get to go back the last few years, back home. And yeah, with me coming into the season a rookie, of course you need time, so I finished, I think, 24th of December, just one day before Christmas. So it's quite a tight squeeze. Not much time, but it's good to be more relaxed now. Q: Mick? MS: Yeah, obviously, it's nice to have a bit more family time. Obviously preparing for next year, it’s going to be a long season. So you know, preparation might look a bit different. But nonetheless, I think we'll take it and we'll enjoy the time that we have. Q: Charles? CL: Not much to add. Pretty happy when the season finishes early. I prefer a very packed season but starting late and finishing early than a very, very long season starting early and finishing late. So yeah, happy to have a bit more time with family and friends. SP: Yeah, I think similar to Charles in that regard. Happy to have a bit of time to spend with the family. And yeah, recover, recharge. It has been an intense season as well with a lot of races, so I'm looking forward to a bit of rest. Q: (Emilio Pineres – El Heraldo de México) This year in Acapulco, the Spanish tennis player Feliciano Lopez said Mexicans and Spaniards are conditioned to love each other, between the culture and history around both countries. What do you think about that sense? FA: I love Mexico. I think everyone will have their own opinion. But I don't know. I think we have very close cultures. And we have a lot in common. Yeah, and for me, as a driver, you know, when I come here to Mexico, I feel the atmosphere, I feel the enthusiasm about the race from everyone in the country. Obviously, with Checo, we see Mexican flags around the world. I think he's a great ambassador of the country, and I'm super happy when I come here. Mexico, has won the best race of the year for three or four consecutive times. So it's not only my opinion, this is a fantastic event. So you know, I'm happy to be here. Q: Checo can we get your thoughts on this? Do you get good vibes in the Spanish Grand Prix for example? SP: Yeah, certainly, I do believe we have a lot in common, the way our cultures are so similar. And yeah, I believe that we love each other, you know, and also, when I go to Spain, I do get a lot of support. You see the passion they have, and it's really similar to what we get, you know, and what they do for Carlos and Fernando, it's something very similar to what I have here. Q: (Alex Kalinauckas – Autosport) Another question to Charles, please. I'm just going back to the start, you said you think that Ferrari is getting there when it comes to doing better against Red Bull on Sundays? Could you expand on that, please? What exactly have you seen that's encouraging – just in the context that you guys still haven't won a race since Austria? CL: Yeah, I was mostly speaking about the Sunday execution not the performance in itself. But as I've been mentioning since a few races, we are working a lot on the strategy, also on the communication side of it. And this I felt like we are taking a step in the right direction but of course there is still the gap of performance on the Sunday to the Red Bull that we still need to find and improve. So on that we are working, we haven't found yet the solution but we are working well. And again, once we are focusing on one thing, we normally improve very quickly on it. So I'm confident that the results will come soon. Q: (Marisol Rojas – El Economista) Today we got the news that we are going to have a Grand Prix until 2025 and I would like to know some opinions. When do you consider the Mexican Grand Prix is most convenient in the Formula 1 schedule. SP: Ah yeah, most convenient for the calendar. I think it's important we put, when we come to the Americas, a much together the races as possible. I mean, because going to Brazil is still a long way, it's a long way to go. So yeah, I think the most convenient would be doing the more back-to-back races when we are in America. That would be great. CL: Yeah, I agree. I mean, looking at this year, I don't think it's the most convenient programme we could have imagined. Obviously, I probably would have preferred throughout the race in Brazil next week, just after Mexico and then you have one week to fly to Abu Dhabi. But yeah, apart from that, I think it’s the right time to do so, it’s just Brazil probably would have been better a week earlier. MS: Yeah, I guess everything has been said in that sense.
'A lot of crashes' - F1 drivers want tyre blanket plan scrapped, https://the-race.com/formula-1/a-lot-of-crashes-f1-drivers-want-tyre-blanket-plan-scrapped/, Formula 1 drivers do not want to persevere with a phased-in tyre blanket ban and world champion Max Verstappen claims it risks “a lot of crashes”. A glide path towards a full blanket ban in 2024 began this year with the reduction in maximum tyre blanket temperature from 100C (front) and 80C (rear) to 70C. So no tyre warmers, a very big issue.”Valtteri Bottas offered some support to the idea of no tyre blankets but only “if the tyres can cope with that”. “Or on a street track, going out with a completely cold set of tyres as the tyre is more like plastic at that temperature. “At the moment, and the tyre we tried in Austin, it couldn’t cope with the 50C blanket, it was really, really, really slippery in the beginning., Formula 1 drivers do not want to persevere with a phased-in tyre blanket ban and world champion Max Verstappen claims it risks “a lot of crashes”. A glide path towards a full blanket ban in 2024 began this year with the reduction in maximum tyre blanket temperature from 100C (front) and 80C (rear) to 70C. Another 20C drop to a 50C maximum for the blankets will occur next year, something that was trialled last weekend in practice at the United States Grand Prix alongside evaluation of Pirelli’s 2023 tyres. Another 2023 tyre test will be held during FP2 in Mexico on Friday and was meant to feature a 50C maximum temperature for the blankets again, which led Red Bull driver Verstappen to predict a “nice drift show”. However, The Race understands that the need to run the blankets no hotter than 50C has been scrapped, so the usual 70C limit will apply for the FP2 tyre test. Verstappen said he only used the hardest compound at Austin and claimed the lack of grip was such that he almost spun in the pitlane. When the full blanket ban for 2024 was put to him, Verstappen said: “Then I think we’re going to have a lot of crashes. It’s tough. “Your tyre degradation is going to be completely different because your tyres are very cold, you’re sliding around a lot in the first few laps, your tyre pressures are going to go through the roof, so your tyres are going to deg a lot more. “At the moment I don’t really enjoy it, but a lot of drivers say the same and we have to of course find a solution to that. “Austin is still a track where you can easily switch on the tyres because of the high-speed corners. “But if you go to a track like a street circuit, like Monaco, can you imagine half-and-half conditions, I think it’s going to take like half the race before you have temperature in your tyres.” McLaren driver Lando Norris said that weather and the circuit layout at Austin made for “the best possible conditions” for the 50C blanket test last weekend and it was still a huge problem. Asked by The Race about Verstappen claiming the rule risks crashes, Norris said: “Yeah, there would be. “This was like the best possible conditions to have these tyres: super-warm, hot track temp, high-speed first sector to get the temp in. And they were not nice. So easy to front lock, so easy to rear lock, completely unpredictable. “Imagine going to a much colder race track, or if it’s a little bit damp or something. “Everyone’s going to shunt the car at some point. “No driver wants it, basically.” Norris said there are already “conversations” between the drivers and the stakeholders and that the most vocal drivers were those who have experienced much lighter F1 cars and better tyres from previous eras. He acknowledged the desire to phase out the blankets rather than make a sudden switch but said it is simply “unsafe”. What looming blanket ban means for F1 Read more “To drive a current era Formula 1 car, which is designed so specifically with all the aero and stuff, in a way not made to go out on cold tyres, it’s not like a Formula 2 or Formula 3 car where you can just throw it about and do whatever,” said Norris. “It doesn’t really work like that so much. “We’ll have discussions about it, between all the drivers and the GPDA.” Haas’s Kevin Magnussen agreed with Norris’s suggestion that the rule is just not compatible with this era of low, stiff, ground-effect F1 cars. “I would really not like it because I don’t think Pirelli and the FIA and Formula 1 really understand how difficult it is to get heat into these tyres even when they come out at 70C,” said Magnussen. “They tried at 50C and that’s already very difficult. I think it’s because they haven’t driven these cars, they don’t understand. “I think there is a safety concern. “It’s very high loads on these cars because of the downforce so the tyre has to be pretty stiff so when it’s cold it’s hard, just like ice. “Whereas in sportscars I just think the tyre is a lower working range and soft, so when it’s cold it’s super easy to warm up. “At 50C here, it’s a big issue. So no tyre warmers, a very big issue.” Valtteri Bottas offered some support to the idea of no tyre blankets but only “if the tyres can cope with that”. The Alfa Romeo driver said that “should be possible” but that the current tyres would make it “impossible in some cases” and indicated the 2023 candidate tyres from Pirelli were not up to it either. “If you do a pitstop onto a hard tyre without blankets nowadays, on a track like this [Mexico City’s Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez] it would be definitely very risky and almost like a safety concern,” he said. “Or on a street track, going out with a completely cold set of tyres as the tyre is more like plastic at that temperature. “But if the tyre changes and if it has been changed for that to work in a much lower range, then why not. “At the moment, and the tyre we tried in Austin, it couldn’t cope with the 50C blanket, it was really, really, really slippery in the beginning. “And that was Austin and that was warm. So on some tracks that would already be an issue.”

Charles: “My first hundred races in Formula 1 have flown by”, https://www.ferrari.com/en-EN/formula1/articles/mexico-city-grand-prix-2022-thursday, Since this year’s Dutch Grand Prix back in the summer, Charles Leclerc moved to tenth on the list of drivers with the most race starts for Scuderia Ferrari and he is currently on 78. Now, this weekend, the Monegasque is ready to join the 100 club, in terms of total F1 races. “To be honest, these first hundred races in Formula 1 have flown by,” admitted Charles in this afternoon’s FIA press conference. “We will try and be in the fight for the win.” Charles had similar thoughts. “In the last two races, I’ve done fewer than two laps, so I think it’s time to have a smooth race with no problems., Since this year’s Dutch Grand Prix back in the summer, Charles Leclerc moved to tenth on the list of drivers with the most race starts for Scuderia Ferrari and he is currently on 78. Now, this weekend, the Monegasque is ready to join the 100 club, in terms of total F1 races. It’s an important landmark for a driver, and Leclerc will be the 78th to have reach this figure. “To be honest, these first hundred races in Formula 1 have flown by,” admitted Charles in this afternoon’s FIA press conference. “It seems like only yesterday that I walked into the paddock in Australia in 2018 to take part in my first Grand Prix. I’m having a wonderful adventure which right from my second season, saw me join the most prestigious team of all. Our first year together was good, especially with my first two wins, but after that we struggled for the next two years. This year, 2022, we have been competitive at every race and have won three of them. Clearly, we are all working as one to get even more next year.” Goals. For Carlos Sainz, Mexico is something of a second home race. “The atmosphere is wonderful and the fact that they speak my language here makes me feel the support of the fans even more,” he said. “You notice it especially when you get to the slowest part of the track and you pass through those really high grandstands, the cheers give you goosebumps. Our goals are the usual ones. “I am sure we will be competitive as we have been all year,” continued the Spaniard. “We will try and be in the fight for the win.” Charles had similar thoughts. “We know our car works very well in qualifying and that we are lacking something on Sunday, but we are working hard and I think there have been signs of progress in recent races. In the end, the key point is always to get the tyres up to the right operating temperature and we know that window is rather small, so that widening it is one of the goals for 2023 that we are working on in this final part of the season.” Carlos is also looking for a bit of good luck. “In the last two races, I’ve done fewer than two laps, so I think it’s time to have a smooth race with no problems. This track requires a lot of aero downforce and traction and we will try and maximise the potential of the F1-75 starting from tomorrow’s free practice. Programme. The first free practice session starts tomorrow at 13 local (20 CET) and the second, extended to 90 minutes for a repeat of the Austin Pirelli 2023 tyre test, gets underway at 16 (23 CET).
Lewis Hamilton wants to stay in F1 until at least 2025, https://www.espn.com/f1/story/_/id/34891842/lewis-hamilton-wants-stay-f1-least-2025, MEXICO CITY -- Lewis Hamilton is planning to stay on the Formula One grid until at least 2025 after opening talks with Mercedes about a contract extension. "I have not a put a limit on it to be honest," he said on Thursday when asked how long he would stay in F1. There are a lot of great things that are being put in place, like I just launched the production company this week, but I feel great in my body and mind. "So I think I'm just in a happy place in my life, a lot more grounded. So it's just a lot better setup all-round, and I feel like I can take the team to more championships.", MEXICO CITY -- Lewis Hamilton is planning to stay on the Formula One grid until at least 2025 after opening talks with Mercedes about a contract extension. Hamilton's current deal is due to expire at the end of next season, but he has made clear that he has no plans to retire at the end of 2023. Instead, the seven-time world champion is looking to sign a new multiyear deal, which would keep him in Formula One until at least 2025 and possibly beyond. "I have not a put a limit on it to be honest," he said on Thursday when asked how long he would stay in F1. "I'm planning to do a multiyear deal with my team. "I really don't know what the next five years ... I think we're still trying to work on that. There are a lot of great things that are being put in place, like I just launched the production company this week, but I feel great in my body and mind. "So, I want to continue, I think there's more stuff for us to achieve together so I want to be here longer, I just don't know. If Fernando leaves maybe I'll have to think about it twice because I'll be the oldest driver then!" Hamilton, now 37, previously said he had no plans to race into his 40s, but now points to various projects outside of F1, including his charitable foundation, Mission 44, as added impetus for staying in the sport. "It's been lingering around, this narrative of me winding towards the end of my career," he added. "I'm sure for all of you in your careers and your jobs you probably have to analyze what's next? Is there someone else you want to go? Is there somewhere higher you want to be? Is there room for growth in that role? I think that was perhaps something for me. "Being a racing driver is a great thing, but I was trying to see 'How am I going to grow beyond this role?' And I think you're seeing that with the work we're doing with Ignite, I've got Mission 44 now, Toto [Wolff] has been a great leader and enabled me to do things. He said to me in the past when Niki [Lauda] would say to him, 'How do you let him do this?' and then eventually they're all coming round to the idea that supporting and enabling people to be their best is better for everybody's interest. "So I think I'm just in a happy place in my life, a lot more grounded. I've got my home that I get to spend time in in the UK when I come to see the team for example, and the family come down. So it's just a lot better setup all-round, and I feel like I can take the team to more championships."
2022 Formula 1 at Mexico: How to watch stream preview TV info for the Mexican Grand Prix, https://www.cbssports.com/motor-sports/news/2022-formula-1-at-mexico-how-to-watch-stream-preview-tv-info-for-the-mexican-grand-prix/, Now comes Sunday's Mexican Grand Prix, and it seems there's not much left to race for except bragging rights. Obviously, a win at his home Grand Prix would go a long way for Perez — known as "Checo" to his friends and fans — clinching the first runner-up position to Verstappen. How to watch the Formula 1 Mexican Grand PrixDate: Sunday, Oct. 30Sunday, Oct. 30 Location: 2.674-mile (4.304-kilometer), 17-turn Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, Mexico City2.674-mile (4.304-kilometer), 17-turn Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, Mexico City Time: 4 p.m. ET TV: ESPNESPN Stream: fuboTV (try for free)What to expectAt 7,342 feet, Autodromo Hermanos Rodríguez is in rarified air. The first DRS zone is at the exit of the Turn 11 chicane to Turn 12, which is very short., That's it then, isn't it? The world champion was decided at Suzuka, with Max Verstappen taking that honor. The Constructors' Cup was clinched by Verstappen's Red Bull Racing team at Circuit of the Americas outside Austin, Texas, this past weekend. Now comes Sunday's Mexican Grand Prix, and it seems there's not much left to race for except bragging rights. Well, actually, there's a lot left to race for at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, such as can Charles Leclerc and Ferrari salvage some pride and finish second in the driver standings, or can Sergio Perez make it a Red Bull 1-2 on the season. Perez is out to become the first home driver to win the Mexican Grand Prix while his illustrious teammate is also in search of his 14th win on the season, which no F1 driver has ever accomplished (Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel hold the record at 13). Obviously, a win at his home Grand Prix would go a long way for Perez — known as "Checo" to his friends and fans — clinching the first runner-up position to Verstappen. Leclerc currently holds a two-point advantage on Perez. And while it is a case of too little, too late, the upgrades Mercedes unleashed at the COTA made them very racy indeed, so expect Lewis Hamilton and teammate George Russell to not go quietly into the night in these final three races of the calendar. How to watch the Formula 1 Mexican Grand Prix Date: Sunday, Oct. 30 Sunday, Oct. 30 Location: 2.674-mile (4.304-kilometer), 17-turn Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, Mexico City 2.674-mile (4.304-kilometer), 17-turn Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, Mexico City Time: 4 p.m. ET 4 p.m. ET TV: ESPN ESPN Stream: fuboTV (try for free) What to expect At 7,342 feet, Autodromo Hermanos Rodríguez is in rarified air. It is, by far, the highest elevation the F1 circus will compete at on the 2022 calendar year (Interlagos, Brazil is the next highest at 4,921 feet), and as can be imagined the thin air causes issues for not just the drivers but also the cars. It should be a track the Ferraris excel at considering the thinner air means that cars carrying more downforce will suffer less of a penalty, and cars with a horsepower advantage may find it harder to breath in that thin air. The signature feature of the track is Turn 17, the Peraltada, a banked, extremely fast corner that brings the field back to the extremely long front straight. This is also the second of the two DRS zones on the track, setting up for drag-race finishes to Turn 1. The first DRS zone is at the exit of the Turn 11 chicane to Turn 12, which is very short. Strategies in the past have seen a one-stopper be the winning formula, with cars starting on the hardest compound being good 50 laps or more, then switching to a softer compound for the sprint to the finish. Whether that compound will be the intermediate or the super soft remains to be discovered by the teams during open practices on Friday and Saturday ahead of Saturday's qualifying. Past races has seen the intermediate last up to 30 laps, so that would mean a pit window strategy somewhere in the 20s, with the hard compounds then being slipped on for the remainder of the scheduled 71 laps. Or do you go with the super softs, hope to get at least 20 laps, then go to the hard compounds? Red Bull Racing has proven to be adept at saving its tires, most likely due to the fact that the cars seem to be running far less downforce than Ferrari and other challengers, so perhaps this will be the roll of the dice team principal Christian Horner takes at Mexico City.

Our goals are the usual ones. “I am sure we will be competitive as we have been all year,” continued the Spaniard. “We will try and be in the fight for the win.” Charles had similar thoughts. “We know our car works very well in qualifying and that we are lacking something on Sunday, but we are working hard and I think there have been signs of progress in recent races. In the end, the key point is always to get the tyres up to the right operating temperature and we know that window is rather small, so that widening it is one of the goals for 2023 that we are working on in this final part of the season.” Carlos is also looking for a bit of good luck. “In the last two races, I’ve done fewer than two laps, so I think it’s time to have a smooth race with no problems. This track requires a lot of aero downforce and traction and we will try and maximise the potential of the F1-75 starting from tomorrow’s free practice. Programme. The first free practice session starts tomorrow at 13 local (20 CET) and the second, extended to 90 minutes for a repeat of the Austin Pirelli 2023 tyre test, gets underway at 16 (23 CET).
Lewis Hamilton wants to stay in F1 until at least 2025, https://www.espn.com/f1/story/_/id/34891842/lewis-hamilton-wants-stay-f1-least-2025, MEXICO CITY -- Lewis Hamilton is planning to stay on the Formula One grid until at least 2025 after opening talks with Mercedes about a contract extension. "I have not a put a limit on it to be honest," he said on Thursday when asked how long he would stay in F1. There are a lot of great things that are being put in place, like I just launched the production company this week, but I feel great in my body and mind. "So I think I'm just in a happy place in my life, a lot more grounded. So it's just a lot better setup all-round, and I feel like I can take the team to more championships.", MEXICO CITY -- Lewis Hamilton is planning to stay on the Formula One grid until at least 2025 after opening talks with Mercedes about a contract extension. Hamilton's current deal is due to expire at the end of next season, but he has made clear that he has no plans to retire at the end of 2023. Instead, the seven-time world champion is looking to sign a new multiyear deal, which would keep him in Formula One until at least 2025 and possibly beyond. "I have not a put a limit on it to be honest," he said on Thursday when asked how long he would stay in F1. "I'm planning to do a multiyear deal with my team. "I really don't know what the next five years ... I think we're still trying to work on that. There are a lot of great things that are being put in place, like I just launched the production company this week, but I feel great in my body and mind. "So, I want to continue, I think there's more stuff for us to achieve together so I want to be here longer, I just don't know. If Fernando leaves maybe I'll have to think about it twice because I'll be the oldest driver then!" Hamilton, now 37, previously said he had no plans to race into his 40s, but now points to various projects outside of F1, including his charitable foundation, Mission 44, as added impetus for staying in the sport. "It's been lingering around, this narrative of me winding towards the end of my career," he added. "I'm sure for all of you in your careers and your jobs you probably have to analyze what's next? Is there someone else you want to go? Is there somewhere higher you want to be? Is there room for growth in that role? I think that was perhaps something for me. "Being a racing driver is a great thing, but I was trying to see 'How am I going to grow beyond this role?' And I think you're seeing that with the work we're doing with Ignite, I've got Mission 44 now, Toto [Wolff] has been a great leader and enabled me to do things. He said to me in the past when Niki [Lauda] would say to him, 'How do you let him do this?' and then eventually they're all coming round to the idea that supporting and enabling people to be their best is better for everybody's interest. "So I think I'm just in a happy place in my life, a lot more grounded. I've got my home that I get to spend time in in the UK when I come to see the team for example, and the family come down. So it's just a lot better setup all-round, and I feel like I can take the team to more championships."
2022 Formula 1 at Mexico: How to watch stream preview TV info for the Mexican Grand Prix, https://www.cbssports.com/motor-sports/news/2022-formula-1-at-mexico-how-to-watch-stream-preview-tv-info-for-the-mexican-grand-prix/, Now comes Sunday's Mexican Grand Prix, and it seems there's not much left to race for except bragging rights. Obviously, a win at his home Grand Prix would go a long way for Perez — known as "Checo" to his friends and fans — clinching the first runner-up position to Verstappen. How to watch the Formula 1 Mexican Grand PrixDate: Sunday, Oct. 30Sunday, Oct. 30 Location: 2.674-mile (4.304-kilometer), 17-turn Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, Mexico City2.674-mile (4.304-kilometer), 17-turn Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, Mexico City Time: 4 p.m. ET TV: ESPNESPN Stream: fuboTV (try for free)What to expectAt 7,342 feet, Autodromo Hermanos Rodríguez is in rarified air. The first DRS zone is at the exit of the Turn 11 chicane to Turn 12, which is very short., That's it then, isn't it? The world champion was decided at Suzuka, with Max Verstappen taking that honor. The Constructors' Cup was clinched by Verstappen's Red Bull Racing team at Circuit of the Americas outside Austin, Texas, this past weekend. Now comes Sunday's Mexican Grand Prix, and it seems there's not much left to race for except bragging rights. Well, actually, there's a lot left to race for at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, such as can Charles Leclerc and Ferrari salvage some pride and finish second in the driver standings, or can Sergio Perez make it a Red Bull 1-2 on the season. Perez is out to become the first home driver to win the Mexican Grand Prix while his illustrious teammate is also in search of his 14th win on the season, which no F1 driver has ever accomplished (Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel hold the record at 13). Obviously, a win at his home Grand Prix would go a long way for Perez — known as "Checo" to his friends and fans — clinching the first runner-up position to Verstappen. Leclerc currently holds a two-point advantage on Perez. And while it is a case of too little, too late, the upgrades Mercedes unleashed at the COTA made them very racy indeed, so expect Lewis Hamilton and teammate George Russell to not go quietly into the night in these final three races of the calendar. How to watch the Formula 1 Mexican Grand Prix Date: Sunday, Oct. 30 Sunday, Oct. 30 Location: 2.674-mile (4.304-kilometer), 17-turn Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, Mexico City 2.674-mile (4.304-kilometer), 17-turn Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez, Mexico City Time: 4 p.m. ET 4 p.m. ET TV: ESPN ESPN Stream: fuboTV (try for free) What to expect At 7,342 feet, Autodromo Hermanos Rodríguez is in rarified air. It is, by far, the highest elevation the F1 circus will compete at on the 2022 calendar year (Interlagos, Brazil is the next highest at 4,921 feet), and as can be imagined the thin air causes issues for not just the drivers but also the cars. It should be a track the Ferraris excel at considering the thinner air means that cars carrying more downforce will suffer less of a penalty, and cars with a horsepower advantage may find it harder to breath in that thin air. The signature feature of the track is Turn 17, the Peraltada, a banked, extremely fast corner that brings the field back to the extremely long front straight. This is also the second of the two DRS zones on the track, setting up for drag-race finishes to Turn 1. The first DRS zone is at the exit of the Turn 11 chicane to Turn 12, which is very short. Strategies in the past have seen a one-stopper be the winning formula, with cars starting on the hardest compound being good 50 laps or more, then switching to a softer compound for the sprint to the finish. Whether that compound will be the intermediate or the super soft remains to be discovered by the teams during open practices on Friday and Saturday ahead of Saturday's qualifying. Past races has seen the intermediate last up to 30 laps, so that would mean a pit window strategy somewhere in the 20s, with the hard compounds then being slipped on for the remainder of the scheduled 71 laps. Or do you go with the super softs, hope to get at least 20 laps, then go to the hard compounds? Red Bull Racing has proven to be adept at saving its tires, most likely due to the fact that the cars seem to be running far less downforce than Ferrari and other challengers, so perhaps this will be the roll of the dice team principal Christian Horner takes at Mexico City.

It was confirmed last month that Latifi and Williams will part ways after this year’s F1 finale in Abu Dhabi – the team’s academy driver and Formula 2 race winner Logan Sargeant set to take his place from the 2023 campaign if he can secure sufficient Super Licence points.

I haven’t decided on anything yet for my future. I mean, of course, I’ve been exploring options. IndyCar is a series I’m considering, for sure, but I’ve not decided on anything yet,” Latifi insisted.

The only thing we’ll have going for us is the straight-line speed, but we’re fast in a straight because we don’t make a lot of downforce, not because we’re extremely efficient in a straight line,” he commented.

Alonso: F1 will have "huge problem" if Austin penalty is upheld, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/alonso-f1-will-have-huge-problem-if-austin-penalty-is-upheld/10391236/, Fernando Alonso managed to finish seventh at Austin despite colliding with Lance Stroll. “And if this is the right decision to take, it will open a huge problem for the future in Formula 1. “It will also open [that] if 20 minutes too late it’s OK to protest – is one month too late? “I don’t care about seventh, I’m not fighting for the world championship. If I’m not P7 at the end, I’m sure they will explain why and we will see it clear., Alonso was handed a 30-second post-race penalty at Austin last weekend as the stewards decided his car had been running in an unsafe condition due to damage sustained in his airborne crash with Aston Martin’s Lance Stroll – specifically his right-side wing mirror moving around before later falling off. The penalty dropped him from seventh to 15th in the final classification and nullified his sterling drive back from running last after the crash. This followed Haas lodging a protest against Alonso’s result and that of Sergio Perez due to the Red Bull driver’s right-side endplate getting damaged in a lap one clash with Valtteri Bottas and then falling off. Haas was particularly upset that neither car was called in, as in similar situations at three other 2022 races Kevin Magnussen was being forced to pit for repairs after getting a black-and-orange flag. Alpine then lodged a protest against the circumstances that led to an investigation into Alonso’s result and penalty, because Haas submitted its protest 24 minutes after the cut-off time for such action and because FIA race control officials never showed Alonso the black-and-orange flag indicating they felt his car was unsafe. A hearing with the USGP stewards to determine if the protest from the French manufacturer is admissible will be held via video conference later on Thursday at 6pm local Mexican time. If Alpine’s protest is deemed as admissible, which Alonso feels confident enough in to state he is now “optimistic that we will keep seventh place”, a separate hearing will then be arranged so Alpine’s protest can be heard. Fernando Alonso managed to finish seventh at Austin despite colliding with Lance Stroll. Photo by: Carl Bingham / Motorsport Images At Thursday's the pre-event press conference at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez Alonso explained why he was so confident he would keep his seventh place, before issuing a warning about the future of post-race protests should Haas’s claim be upheld, as well as what could happen to drivers running with damaged cars in future events. “First of all, you cannot appeal any decision of time penalties – that’s how the rules are written,” he said. “Which is nice, because whatever decision you take you cannot appeal – I would love to have that when driving! “But we protested basically because [the Haas protest was submitted] out of time and there were a couple of things – that the FIA was not showing me the black-and-orange flag. “They thought the car was safe to keep driving. The car went to parc ferme, passed all the scrutineering, green light on parc ferme, and then the protest arrived too late. “So, between all I think there is no doubt that this was not the right decision to take. “And if this is the right decision to take, it will open a huge problem for the future in Formula 1. “I think 50, 60, 70% of the cars will have to retire when they have an aerodynamic device that is not properly fixed, because the car is gonna be unsafe. “It will also open [that] if 20 minutes too late it’s OK to protest – is one month too late? Is one hour too late? Is 10 years too late? When is too late? “That, I think, we cannot afford. As I said, this is a very important day for our sport. “I don’t care about seventh, I’m not fighting for the world championship. But if this goes ahead, I think we will open a very… we don’t want to open that box.” Alonso, whose reported 42G impact in the crash with Stroll does not appear to have resulted in him suffering any ill-effects ahead of this weekend’s race, called his Sunday at Austin “a rollercoaster of emotions”. He also insisted he has full confidence in F1’s officiating – which has been under major focus after the 2021 Abu Dhabi GP farce and several other controversial decisions since – ahead of the hearing into the admissibility of Alpine’s protest. “[The] FIA has been very transparent to us this year,” Alonso explained. “The new leadership with Mohammed [Ben Sulayem, FIA president] I think are doing things a little bit different than in the past. “So, I fully trust what they will decide. I think there are a couple of things that were very clear that were made wrong from their side [regarding the in-race calls that meant Alonso was not shown the black-and-orange flag]. “I’m very confident I will be again P7 again in Austin. If I’m not P7 at the end, I’m sure they will explain why and we will see it clear. So, I’m very relaxed about that.”
Red Bull agrees terms with FIA over 2021 F1 cost cap breach, https://the-race.com/formula-1/red-bull-agrees-terms-with-fia-over-2021-f1-cost-cap-breach/, The Red Bull Formula 1 team has agreed terms with the FIA for an Accepted Breach Agreement regarding its 2021 cost cap overspend. The FIA announced earlier this month that Red Bull had committed both minor and procedural breaches of the cap. What is an accepted breach agreement in F1’s cost cap rules? Read moreAn Accepted Breach Agreement allows the Cost Cap Administration body to make an agreement with the team involved in which the team acknowledges it has broken the cost cap rules but potentially receives lesser penalties than might have been the case had it gone into the formal cost cap adjudication process. Entering into an Accepted Breach Agreement means more severe penalties such as points deductions or reductions in future budget cap amounts are off the table., The Red Bull Formula 1 team has agreed terms with the FIA for an Accepted Breach Agreement regarding its 2021 cost cap overspend. Details of the agreement and Red Bull’s penalty for it will be communicated on Friday before practice for the Mexican Grand Prix begins. The FIA announced earlier this month that Red Bull had committed both minor and procedural breaches of the cap. It was revealed ahead of the United States GP that the governing body had proposed an Accepted Breach Agreement in this case, but discussions with Red Bull over it were paused following the death of company co-founder Dietrich Mateschitz. What is an accepted breach agreement in F1’s cost cap rules? Read more An Accepted Breach Agreement allows the Cost Cap Administration body to make an agreement with the team involved in which the team acknowledges it has broken the cost cap rules but potentially receives lesser penalties than might have been the case had it gone into the formal cost cap adjudication process. It’s effectively the equivalent of a plea bargain being struck to avoid a case going to a ‘trial’ stage. The Race understands that a fine and a reduction in the amount of aerodynamic testing time Red Bull is allowed in the future is likely, and that this was always the level of punishment the FIA was aiming for in this case. Entering into an Accepted Breach Agreement means more severe penalties such as points deductions or reductions in future budget cap amounts are off the table. Asked by The Race on Thursday in Mexico if he was now just looking forward to the cost cap controversy being resolved and over, world champion Max Verstappen said Red Bull was still surprised by what the FIA had judged was a breach. “It’s just a bit frustrating,” he replied. “From our side we feel like we are not wrong. Just some things are taken into the budget cap which are very unexpected, but we’ll have to deal with it. It’s not up to me to decide what’s right.” Verstappen’s 2021 title battle with Lewis Hamilton was already one of the most polarising and fractious in F1 history even before it emerged Red Bull had breached the cost cap during it. When it was suggested by The Race that some might use the breach as another reason to focus on the controversial elements of that season – such as the mishandled safety car procedure in the Abu Dhabi decider – over the quality of his driving in 2021, Verstappen replied that it would probably make little difference to his critics’ already-established views. “They are sore anyway, so it doesn’t matter what you say or what you do,” he said. Asked by The Race if he could therefore just brush that element off, Verstappen added: “From my side, I can. Probably they can’t and they will never be able to. So that’s a problem for them to deal with.”

Bahrain: Torture victims file legal complaint against Formula One, https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/bahrain-formula-one-torture-victims-file-legal-complaint, Two Bahraini women allegedly tortured after protesting Formula One's Grand Prix in the kingdom have filed a legal complaint against the company saying it has breached the human rights standards it pledged to follow. In 2015, F1 established a human rights policy following similar legal action by Bahraini rights advocates. Mansoor, who lives in Bahrain, said in a statement she was taking a personal risk participating in the complaint. "My son is currently serving an arbitrary prison sentence over fabricated charges, partly as a reprisal for his brother-in-law’s human rights work, which included engaging with Formula One," she said. The Bahrain F1 Grand Prix is scheduled to be held in March 2023., Two Bahraini women allegedly tortured after protesting Formula One's Grand Prix in the kingdom have filed a legal complaint against the company saying it has breached the human rights standards it pledged to follow. Najah Yusuf, Hajer Mansoor and the UK-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (Bird), which is also party to the complaint, contend that F1 failed to conduct human rights due diligence before Bahrain was awarded the longest contract in the company's history in February. Yusuf, who was allegedly imprisoned and tortured for three years following her social media criticism of F1, said in a statement on Thursday that she was "heartbroken" by F1's inaction. “My life was changed forever by this race. To see my letters ignored by F1 is heartbreaking. I need their help in getting justice. It seems like they only care about profits," Yusuf said. 'My life was changed forever by this race' - Najah Yusuf Yusuf and the others allege that, despite attempts by the Bahraini government to use the event to "sportwash" the kingdom's image, human rights abuses by authorities suppressing protests spike each year when the Grand Prix is held. Formula 1 did not respond to MEE's request for comment. The complaint was lodged on Wednesday with the UK National Contact Point (UK NCP), which is part of the UK's international trade department and handles allegations of British firms breaking guidelines of the intergovernmental Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. In 2015, F1 established a human rights policy following similar legal action by Bahraini rights advocates. Current complainants say F1 is failing to implement that policy or respond to their correspondence. Yusuf, a former civil servant and mother of four who lives in Bahrain, condemned F1 and the Bahraini government in a 2017 Facebook post, calling the Grand Prix "nothing more than a way for the al-Khalifa family to whitewash their criminal record and gross human rights violations," referring to the island kingdom's ruling royal family. Yusuf says she was assaulted, tortured and imprisoned for three years following the post and only released by royal pardon in August 2019 after international pressure. Personal risk Mansoor was arrested, allegedly tortured and imprisoned in 2017 in connection with her protest activities and over charges she planted fake bombs. She was released in 2020. She has long denied the charges and supporters believe she was held as reprisal for the protest activities of her son-in-law, Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, who is the director of Bird. Alwadaei was shot by police birdshot in 2012 during an anti-F1 protest. Lewis Hamilton and the battle for Formula One's place in the Gulf Read More » Mansoor's son and Alwadaei's brother-in-law, Sayed Nizar Alwadaei, is serving an 11-year prison sentence. He was arrested at the age of 18 and like his mother, he was convicted on charges he planted fake bombs. In 2019, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention ruled that his detention was arbitrary. Mansoor, who lives in Bahrain, said in a statement she was taking a personal risk participating in the complaint. "My son is currently serving an arbitrary prison sentence over fabricated charges, partly as a reprisal for his brother-in-law’s human rights work, which included engaging with Formula One," she said. "For them to now fail to even acknowledge our letter adds insult to injury and their disregard for human rights.” The Bahraini embassy in London did not respond to MEE's request for comment. The UK NCP will now decide whether to investigate the complaint's allegations. The Bahrain F1 Grand Prix is scheduled to be held in March 2023.

Hamilton: Finding limit of Mercedes F1 car like creeping up behind a kicking horse, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/hamilton-finding-limit-of-mercedes-like-creeping-up-behind-a-kicking-horse/10390919/, The seven-time world champion has endured a difficult 2022 campaign with the Mercedes W13, which has suffered from excessive bouncing and a lack of performance. Hamilton has described the car as the most ‘unpredictable’ of his career, and says the experience of taming it has been a challenge. “It’s been a bunch of different things from the get-go,” he said. Asked about a shift of competitiveness in the team, Hamilton said: “George is doing a great job. I’m doing all the leg-work, back and forth here and there, different wings, all these different things and I like that anyway., The seven-time world champion has endured a difficult 2022 campaign with the Mercedes W13, which has suffered from excessive bouncing and a lack of performance. Hamilton has described the car as the most ‘unpredictable’ of his career, and says the experience of taming it has been a challenge. Speaking in an interview with selected media, including Autosport, looking back at the 2022 season, Hamilton said of the car: “I described it to my engineers: imagine if you are creeping up behind a horse and you’re trying to get as close as possible, what’s the breaking point before it kicks you in the face? And you know it’s going to hurt when it hits your face. “That’s one of the best ways I can say what it’s like, when you’re trying to lean on the car and it’s snapping and unrecoverable. And this car, it’s random.” Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes W13 Photo by: Erik Junius Hamilton said that he knew from the very first test with the car before the start of the season that things were not going to be easy – but he had hoped the team would get on top of things quicker than it did. “I had a feeling when I first drove the car. But you can never say no, and you can never say never,” he said. “Maybe we would have fixed it by the first race. Who knows? “It’s sometimes difficult to know how long it’s going to take to fix those things. Plus, I’d never had bouncing like that. "I didn’t expect the guys to take as long. They didn’t expect it to take as long as it’s taken them to understand what’s causing the bouncing. They’ve had to create new tools, all these things we didn’t have before. "You just hold on to hope. And then the next upgrade comes and it doesn’t work, and the next one comes and doesn’t work. Imagine people that are building those things and they are seeing performance in the windtunnel but they are not seeing it on the track. Ah Jesus, you just keep getting knocked back down. “But what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, and we’re still standing tall. It’s not going to be easy to change the car into a leading car for next year but I think we have a much better understanding in why the car is the way it is.” Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes W13 Photo by: Zak Mauger / Motorsport Images While the extreme bouncing of Mercedes has been a key factor in holding Mercedes back, Hamilton says there were several factors at play to explain the lack of performance compared to Ferrari and Red Bull. “It’s been a bunch of different things from the get-go,” he said. “Bouncing was the one that’s most visible. "Stiffness, global stiffness of the car, to the point that the suspension is pretty useless. Stiffer than the tyres. The tyres are then squashing and bouncing, so we’re bouncing on the tyres as well. “And then aero characteristics. Drag is a huge problem for us. When we get past a certain speed that’s when other people are pulling away. “It’s when you brake and the front dips and the rear comes up and the aero transferring during that period and when you get on the power. It’s different between low and high-speed. There are so many problems. “That’s why literally I have tried everything. I’ve tried every setting you can possibly do. That’s what I was doing at the beginning of the year. “The whole idea of performing at your best and getting the best result each weekend, of course that would be nice but I was really about problem solving. So: 'I will sacrifice this session or all the sessions to be able to find more data and information for you.' So that when we go back to the factory they’ve got a better understanding of what’s going on. But it ultimately hindered some of the weekends.” George Russell, Mercedes W13 Photo by: Erik Junius That willingness to experiment over the season also played a part in the dynamics between Hamilton and team-mate George Russell – who enjoyed several stand out qualifying and race performances. Asked about a shift of competitiveness in the team, Hamilton said: “George is doing a great job. I don’t have any problems with it. There’s no issues in the background with us. “George, I would say, and his team, they don’t experiment the same, obviously. But that’s because I’ve been here for a long time, so I’m willing to take these risks. “I have the big, deep conversations with people I’ve been with for 10 years. So, me and Shov [Andrew Shovlin] can have arguments, constructive arguments. “George, it’s his first year with the team so he’s come in and he’s just doing his job to the best of his ability. Very little movement of setup. I’m doing all the leg-work, back and forth here and there, different wings, all these different things and I like that anyway. “If we come into next year and we have a car that we are much happier with, then we can be more focussed on that whole… not having to go crazy with setups. Then we can have a better battle. “If he finishes ahead at the end of the season, I don’t really feel anything about it; we’re not in the championship. We are fourth and sixth. Now, if it was first and second, it’s different.”
Hamilton's contract talks are deserved after he sacrificed season to be Mercedes' guinea pig, https://inews.co.uk/sport/formula-one/lewis-hamilton-contract-talks-f1-2022-season-mercedes-guinea-pig-1937893, Lewis Hamilton turns 38 in January, a time when sport’s cadences ordinarily steer participants towards a natural close. It might have been the case with Hamilton had Abu Dhabi confirmed him as an eight-time world champion. Hamilton would have preferred to have touched down in Mexico in the teeth of yet another championship gale. Hamilton volunteered himself as the guinea pig in the early races while his team-mate George Russell concentrated on assimilating himself into the team. In reality, Hamilton sacrificed himself for the team, enduring all manner of failures as the team disappeared down a succession of set-up rabbit holes., Lewis Hamilton turns 38 in January, a time when sport’s cadences ordinarily steer participants towards a natural close. Sixteen consecutive summers pounding around the circuits of the world would breach the limits of most. It might have been the case with Hamilton had Abu Dhabi confirmed him as an eight-time world champion. Would the incentive to go again have been as great were he alone in the pantheon of champions with eight drivers’ titles? What we do know is last season’s cruel denial coupled with traumas associated with this season’s car have renewed Hamilton’s commitment not shattered it, lit his desire to extend his career into his forties. Hamilton would have preferred to have touched down in Mexico in the teeth of yet another championship gale. Instead, he has used his time to clear out the attic, to spring clean the mental furniture and plan an extended future behind the wheel. “We are going to do another deal. My goal is to continue with Mercedes. I’ve been with Mercedes since I was 13,” Hamilton said. “They’ve stuck with me through thick and thin, through being expelled at school, through everything that was going on through 2020 (Black Lives Matter protests), through my mistakes and s___ that’s been in the press, through the ups and downs. “I’m trying to analyse my next three to five-year plan. It’s difficult to do ten. Where do I see myself? What are the things I want to do? What are my goals? I’m adding in lots of business things, a lot of successful, really positive things outside. “But I want to keep racing. I love what I do. I’ve been doing it for 30 years, and I don’t feel that I should have to stop. I think I’m still earning my keep. I want to do better, still.” Hamilton expects his future to be settled within months. Since the prospect of a race win has receded in 2022 the focus falls on 2023 when Mercedes have pledged to run a car with much altered architecture. Lewis Hamilton has helped George Russell settle into the Mercedes team (Photo: Reuters) Since Canada, when Hamilton gave up trying to experiment his was out of the mess in favour of getting the best out of what he had, his results have picked up. Hamilton volunteered himself as the guinea pig in the early races while his team-mate George Russell concentrated on assimilating himself into the team. The results suggested Russell had the measure of Hamilton encouraging many to connect the events of 2021 with latter’s performance in 2022. In reality, Hamilton sacrificed himself for the team, enduring all manner of failures as the team disappeared down a succession of set-up rabbit holes. In the latter half of the season, Hamilton has outraced his team-mate and outqualified him at the last five grands prix to lead 12-7. “You do all the work in the simulator and the simulator’s telling you something different to what you get at the track,” he said. “You think, the car feels quite good this weekend or the engineers say ‘okay we’ve got an upgrade that’s worth three tenths’ and you get there and it’s a tenth slower. And you’re ‘oh shoot’. I think I’ve learned just not to get my hopes up with anything. It’s better to kind of under-expect and, if it’s just as good it’s just as good, and if it’s better, it’s better.” As hard as Hamilton tries he can never be totally free of the past. Echoes of 2021 have resurfaced through the budget cap fiasco that still awaits resolution following Red Bull’s reported $1.8m (£1.55m) transgression. “That, for sure, brings up a little bit of emotion. You kind of buried it and moved on and then it comes back up, and then it’s like another bit of a kick. That just bought it all kind of fresh again.” How to watch Mexican Grand Prix 2022 TV: Sky Sports holds the right to broadcast all F1 races live in the UK, while Channel 4 shows highlights of both qualifying and the race later in the day.

The link between an offence that took place in 2021 and the Abu Dhabi denouement is all too easy to make, and when put to Hamilton brought unresolved emotions racing to the surface. “It was definitely spirit-breaking, or soul-crushing, whatever you want to call it,” he added. “Just to believe that the sport would do something like that. An outcome of a world championship, which so many people have worked so hard for, would come out through a wrong decision from somebody. “That was probably the only thing. If you can lose a championship through wrongdoing within an organisation. That was the thing that I wondered [about].” The FIA’s supervision of the budget cap has done little to repair trust nor dispel doubts about the competence of F1’s ruling body to govern the sport. Last year’s pledge to build back stronger after Red Bull petitioned race director Michael Masi into making a series of irregular decisions has run into more procedural confusion. The FIA’s insistence on secrecy serves neither governing body, team nor the sport well. Hamilton is not the only one shaking his head.

F1 faces legal challenge over Bahrain contract and sportswashing, https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/oct/27/f1-faces-legal-challenge-over-over-bahrain-contract-and-sportswashing, Yusuf was detained and abused in prison after peaceful criticism of F1 in Bahrain in 2017 and Bird maintains Mansoor was also detained and mistreated at the same time. Bird has been campaigning to ensure F1 sticks to its commitment to respect human rights issues where it holds races. The pressure group says it has received no satisfactory response to its calls for F1 to investigate human rights issues in Bahrain and believes repression around the race has steadily become worse. In February F1 agreed a new deal with Bahrain to host the race until 2036, the longest contract in the sport’s history, sparking Bird to adopt a formal legal approach. The Human Rights Watch group is to publish a report next week entitled: You Can’t Call Bahrain a Democracy: Bahrain’s Political Isolation Laws., Formula One faces a legal complaint accusing it of breaching Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development guidelines after the sport concluded a deal this year extending its contract to hold races in Bahrain until 2036. The complaint, made through the British government’s UK National Contact Point (NCP), which addresses issues of responsible business conduct, has been served by the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (Bird) and two alleged torture survivors from Bahrain, Najah Yusuf and Hajer Mansoor. Yusuf was detained and abused in prison after peaceful criticism of F1 in Bahrain in 2017 and Bird maintains Mansoor was also detained and mistreated at the same time. Bird has been campaigning to ensure F1 sticks to its commitment to respect human rights issues where it holds races.

In February F1 agreed a new deal with Bahrain to host the race until 2036, the longest contract in the sport’s history, sparking Bird to adopt a formal legal approach. The complaint alleges: “Formula One failed to engage with human rights stakeholders including human rights organisations, legislators from across Europe, victims impacted by the Formula One race and those who have faced reprisals for their human rights work.” It accuses F1 of having failed to conduct a due diligence process in assessment of human rights before awarding the new contract and alleges that “forced disappearances, extrajudicial killing and torture” continue to occur in Bahrain. Anti-F1 graffiti in the village of Barbar, west of Manama, the capital of Bahrain, in 2012. Photograph: Hamad I Mohammed/Reuters The complaint specifically accuses F1 of being complicit in sportswashing, noting that the regime has used the event to promote a public display of unity within the kingdom over one of suppression. It alleges that F1 intensifies this oppression, stating: “The race has been responsible for a considerable spike in human rights abuses as the government acts to forestall and suppress protest around the time of the race.” The intent of pursuing legal action through the UK NCP is to force the issue to the OECD, which then may take action against F1. Part of the impetus behind the sport implementing a human rights policy was because of a previous complaint made by the NCP and Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, director of advocacy at Bird, hoped this, too, would provoke action from F1.

We are now escalating the matter by taking it before the UK NCP.” Next year Bahrain is set to hold the opening race of next season and its only pre-season test but criticism of the regime is intensifying. The Human Rights Watch group is to publish a report next week entitled: You Can’t Call Bahrain a Democracy: Bahrain’s Political Isolation Laws. It will document the Bahraini government’s use of political isolation laws and other tactics to keep activists and opposition members out of public office and public life, in what are described as further human rights abuses. “Bahrain has spent the last decade cracking down on peaceful opposition and the political isolation laws are yet another example of the government’s repression expanding into new spheres,” said Joey Shea, Middle East and North Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch. “These draconian laws have made a mockery of Bahrain’s upcoming parliamentary ‘elections’, which can neither be free nor fair when you make any political opposition essentially illegal.” Quick Guide How do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?

F1 has been approached but is yet to comment on the complaint. However, it has previously stated its position in relation to Bahrain. “We have always been clear with all race promoters and governments with which we deal worldwide that we take violence, abuse of human rights and repression very seriously. “Our human rights policy is very clear and states that the Formula One companies are committed to respecting internationally recognised human rights in its operations globally and have made our position on human rights clear to all our partners and host countries who commit to respect human rights in the way their events are hosted and delivered.”
At U.S. Grand Prix It’s Clear F1 Has Its Foot on the Gas in the States, https://www.si.com/formula1/2022/10/27/us-grand-prix-formula-1-future-circuit-of-the-americas, An increasing number of races in the U.S. and a likely new American driver are feeding a steadily growing fanbase in the country. But despite being at the pinnacle of their sport, drivers remember walking around in the U.S. and going largely unnoticed. Netflix’s Drive to Survive was first released in March 2019, and it gained even more momentum during the pandemic lockdown. And I think there’s a culture in the U.S. also to make the sport a show. Williams team boss Jost Capito confirmed on Saturday that as long as Logan Sargeant has the necessary points for his Super License, the Florida native will be the team’s second F1 driver in 2023., An increasing number of races in the U.S. and a likely new American driver are feeding a steadily growing fanbase in the country. AUSTIN—The ruckus of Formula One fans within the grandstands at Circuit of the Americas threatened to overpower the roar of the cars as they readied for the start of the 2022 U.S. Grand Prix on Sunday, As the lights went out, the cars sped off, tight battles for positions forming as the 20 drivers barreled up a massive hill to Turn 1. A massive American flag loomed overhead as George Russell spun Carlos Sainz, groans echoing from spectators as the Ferrari driver’s day came to an end. Given the environment around the 3.4-mile track, it’s hard to imagine that the drivers’ championship was decided the prior race in Japan. A record-breaking 440,000 fans flooded the complex throughout the four-day weekend, marking the highest attendance this season—The Australian Grand Prix was the closest in 2022 with 420,000 spectators, and while the race day attendance numbers have not been confirmed yet at COTA, it’s likely to have exceeded Silverstone’s 142,000. The likes of Ed Sheeran, Serena Williams, Shaq and Brad Pitt (who is starring in an upcoming F1-themed movie) were among the star-studded names in the COTA paddock this weekend. It’s hard to believe that just a few seasons ago only 265,000 fans filled COTA during 2018’s race weekend. But Lewis Hamilton feels F1 has “finally tapped into the country.” “At the end of the day, there’s 20 drivers that are athletes, that are putting their life on the line, weekend in, weekend out,” Hamilton said. “And unlike the other sports, which are also exciting, there's a lot of players … In terms of athletes, there’s only 20 of us so it’s a very, very small group of us that get to drive these rockets basically around so we’re as close to NASA, I guess, as we can be.” Formula One moved the United States Grand Prix to Circuit of the Americas beginning in 2012 and only missed a single season in the last decade, which was because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But despite being at the pinnacle of their sport, drivers remember walking around in the U.S. and going largely unnoticed. That is until F1’s big boom happened. Netflix’s Drive to Survive was first released in March 2019, and it gained even more momentum during the pandemic lockdown. Even Red Bull driver Max Verstappen, who has been critical of the show in the past, acknowledged its importance, saying, “Up until a few years ago, the sport was very closed. You couldn’t really get close to the teams. Everything is opening up a little bit more. And then, because of Netflix giving a bit more insight, you start to understand a little bit more of what’s going on and you don’t just see the cars driving around. That’s why people are a lot more excited about Formula One now.” Coupled with the rise of TikTok and F1 content creators as well as a broadcast deal with ESPN, there’s more access to the sport for American viewers than ever before, and it’s coincided with the increase in popularity. “It’s incredible to see the progression from the first year I’ve been here, in 2018, to now. The sport has grown massively in the U.S., so much more people in Austin, much more difficult to go around the city easily,” Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc said after a third-place finish. “But it’s a good sign. And I think there’s a culture in the U.S. also to make the sport a show. And this is really the way I see it now. And there’s a challenge of keeping the DNA of the sport, adding the show, and I think this has been done extremely well. I can’t wait to see what was going to happen in Vegas next year, which will probably be crazy.” The sport added the Miami Grand Prix to the schedule this season, and beginning next year, there will be three United States-based races with the Las Vegas Grand Prix taking place in November 2023. There’s no doubt the sport is booming in the States, but the question is whether it’s a flash-in-the-pan moment or a new era of sports for American fans. The introduction of a home driver could only add to the growing excitement. Williams team boss Jost Capito confirmed on Saturday that as long as Logan Sargeant has the necessary points for his Super License, the Florida native will be the team’s second F1 driver in 2023. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner explained Saturday how critical a move like this is for the sport. “I think we see the growth in the U.S., we see the excitement that there is. I came from Vegas earlier in the week and seeing the plans there for that race as well, which looks to be an epic event, you can see the American public are really engaged in Formula One, and I think we need an American driver,” Horner said. “Not only just a driver, we need a successful driver in there competing as well. It shouldn't just be Brad Pitt. So I think that, it’s exciting for Formula One, it's exciting times and the sport’s growing and developing. And I think we'll see more American talent developing and emerging. Certainly we’ve got some interesting candidates on our junior program that we’re investing in.” Sargeant could be the current face of Formula One in the U.S. Erick W. Rasco/Sports Illustrated Sargeant is third in the standings with one round left on the F2 calendar, but two more F1 practice sessions with Williams this season could help soften the buffer. Drivers get an extra point for exceeding 100 km, which he did during first practice in Texas this weekend. If it all goes to plan after Abu Dhabi, Sergeant will be the first American on the F1 grid since Alexander Rossi in 2015. Sergeant got his start with karting at just six years old, but he describes that it was a “hobby” at the time, something fun during the weekends. However, after that, “everything just escalated very quickly.” Although there are options like NASCAR and IndyCar here in the States, Sergeant decided to dive into European racing, making the move across the pond at 12 years old. “I was still young at the time. So I had a push from behind as well, which is sometimes what you need,” Sergeant says as he reflects on that major decision to move to Europe. “And you’re also a bit ... oblivious to how big of a jump it is and how big of a deal [and] commitment it is. But I think that was the best way it could be. And yeah, I think to get to Formula One you needed to make that jump to Europe. The path through America to get to F1 is extremely difficult.” He’s lived on his own since 17, now residing in London as he competes for Carlin in F2. At first, the British city “was not quite to [his] taste,” but it has grown on him over the years. Just not so much the weather. Although the announcement of his tentative F1 debut came a day after his first practice session, Sergeant says that moment had been months in the works. He won back-to-back F2 feature races at Silverstone and Spielberg, Austria, and midseason is when he realized his F1 dream could be a reality. “[In] the middle of season, we started to really pick up on some good results, start getting some wins, some pole positions, and everything was just flowing very nicely,” he says. “The performance was obviously there, and that's sort of where my expectations sort of shifted—to constantly be at the front and fighting for wins and podiums. And that's sort of where it took a turn.” Watching Sargeant during Friday’s first practice, it is hard to tell that he is just in his rookie F2 season. He may have finished 19th, but he recorded 23 trouble-free laps. And he says the session “was everything I expected, plus a lot more.” The 21-year-old did anticipate “everything to be extremely quick. “The high-speed sector one was definitely an eye opener, how much speed that the cars are capable of carrying as well as how effective the brakes are, compared to what I’m used to in Formula Two,” Sargeant said. “And I just didn't think that the gap between the two series would be quite as big as it was.” Sergeant remembers watching the battle between Felipe Massa and Hamilton for the title in 2008, and while watching the F1 greats of the years, he asks, “Who doesn't want to be one of them?” He’s noticed the shift within America as Formula One became more popular in recent years, adding that his friends showed little interest years ago, but now constantly pepper him with questions. America does have a home team in Haas, but adding a U.S. native driver signifies the growth that continues to come for F1. “For America, I think they need a driver to root for,” Sargeant says. “And I will do my best to, hopefully, be someone they all like and appreciate. But I feel like from an American driver’s point of view, I hope it just gives young drivers that belief to make that step to Europe and to make that sacrifice, that if you do work hard that it all will work out.” More Racing Coverage:

Ricciardo has been comprehensively outperformed by his McLaren team-mate Lando Norris since he switched from Renault to McLaren in 2021., “If Daniel decides to have one year off, from experience I know once you leave this sport normally you shouldn’t come back.” Few people are better placed to talk about Formula 1 drivers taking sabbaticals than two-time F1 world champion Mika Hakkinen. ﻿ After winning back-to-back titles with McLaren, Hakkinen narrowly lost out on a third F1 title in 2000 to Michael Schumacher and then was powerless to stop Schumacher from romping to the crown in 2001 in dominant fashion. That led to Hakkinen’s decision to take a sabbatical from F1 at the end of 2001 which would turn into a fully-fledged retirement as he never returned to racing in F1 again. ‘Choosing to laugh as I don’t want to cry’ – Ricciardo’s US GP Read more Outgoing McLaren driver Daniel Ricciardo has revealed he’ll spend 2023 on the sidelines but has emphasised his desire to return to F1 in 2024 if he can find the right project. Comparisons have been drawn between Hakkinen and Ricciardo but there are key differences as the two-time F1 champion points out to Edd Straw on the new ‘Flat Out with Mika Hakkinen’ section of The Race F1 Podcast. “I think my position was a little bit different because I was already a two-time world champion, I’d achieved my goals,” Hakkinen said. “Daniel has a different situation. His performance has been dropping, he’s not going flat-out there. So people are not sure with him if he’s quick enough. “That could make it difficult having a year off and coming back because if you’re not quick enough, there’s always some kind of explanation, some reason. “And I feel he’s not giving this information very clearly to media, to fans, to the team. That’s a bit scary, you have to know why I’m not able to maximise my performance to the same level as my team-mate.” Then-McLaren boss Ron Dennis convinced Hakkinen to make his retirement announcement a sabbatical plan at the end of 2001, but the Finn revealed that early in 2002 he knew he wasn’t going to return to racing in F1. “I thought ‘OK if you feel like it I’d appreciate it, I will see what happens’,” Hakkinen said of his decision to announce a sabbatical rather than a retirement. “But I did recognise after three-four months, when the season [2002] started and I was in Monaco or wherever I was, I was definitely feeling like ‘no way I wanted to go back there’. “It requires so much energy, so much power from your body and physiologically, a lot of energy. I knew that way it doesn’t matter if I have one year off, I cannot come back. I already knew that halfway through the season that I’m not coming back. “If Daniel decides to have one year off, from experience I know once you leave this sport normally you shouldn’t come back. You can’t perform out there while thinking ‘should I retire or not’. [You have to] go flat-out every second.” More from Mika Hakkinen on Amp Want more F1?

Ricciardo gives update on 2023 F1 reserve role chances Read more The Australian has scored just 21% of the team’s points this season, struggling to adapt to McLaren’s 2022 car and unable to consistently drive it in the way Norris does. “It’s definitely not easy,” Hakkinen said of Ricciardo’s situation. “When I was racing we had a lot of testing, we were testing those cars constantly. “The car was tailor-made for you and now the cars are not really tailor-made for you because you are not allowed to do testing. “So the engineers have to do a lot of calculations, back in the factory to build the car for the coming season. “If the driver complains during the weekend of some driving balance problem with the car, they can change the springs, the aerodynamic, the differential, the braking balance, tyre pressures, but they are also quite limited these days what you’re allowed to change. “The things you can do are very little. And if you do have a driving style which is aggressive in the entry, then you need to build the set-up in a way the car still handles nicely in mid-corner and exit. “But if you cannot change the geometries of the front suspension or rear suspension, it makes your life really complicated, that means you have to adapt for this issue. “Adapting your driving style if the car doesn’t work, it’s awful. It’s not fun at all but if your team-mate can do it, then you can do it too.” Hakkinen called Ricciardo a “great character” and expressed his hope that the McLaren driver can turn things around and continue in F1 in 2024. But he also highlighted the risky moves Ricciardo has made during his career, having first left Red Bull for Renault at the end of 2018 and then switched to McLaren two years later. Hakkinen in contrast joined McLaren in 1993 (pictured above) after spending his first two years in F1 with Team Lotus and remained at McLaren until his retirement at the end of 2001. “I joined McLaren, a team with an unbelievable history,” Hakkinen explained.

This long-term, people learn who you are, you learn the engineers. “They learn to understand your driving technique, and they know long-term what you need to have a car to win. “And I think Daniel changed his team quite often, Red Bull, Renault, McLaren and changing teams, I always think it’s a risk. “People learn to know who you are, but understanding what is your driving technique, not so simple to see that, to explain that. “To do that requires a long time.”

Hamilton: Finding limit of Mercedes F1 car like creeping up behind a kicking horse, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/hamilton-finding-limit-of-mercedes-like-creeping-up-behind-a-kicking-horse/10390919/, The seven-time world champion has endured a difficult 2022 campaign with the Mercedes W13, which has suffered from excessive bouncing and a lack of performance. Hamilton has described the car as the most ‘unpredictable’ of his career, and says the experience of taming it has been a challenge. “It’s been a bunch of different things from the get-go,” he said. Asked about a shift of competitiveness in the team, Hamilton said: “George is doing a great job. I’m doing all the leg-work, back and forth here and there, different wings, all these different things and I like that anyway., The seven-time world champion has endured a difficult 2022 campaign with the Mercedes W13, which has suffered from excessive bouncing and a lack of performance. Hamilton has described the car as the most ‘unpredictable’ of his career, and says the experience of taming it has been a challenge. Speaking in an interview with selected media, including Autosport, looking back at the 2022 season, Hamilton said of the car: “I described it to my engineers: imagine if you are creeping up behind a horse and you’re trying to get as close as possible, what’s the breaking point before it kicks you in the face? And you know it’s going to hurt when it hits your face. “That’s one of the best ways I can say what it’s like, when you’re trying to lean on the car and it’s snapping and unrecoverable. And this car, it’s random.” Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes W13 Photo by: Erik Junius Hamilton said that he knew from the very first test with the car before the start of the season that things were not going to be easy – but he had hoped the team would get on top of things quicker than it did. “I had a feeling when I first drove the car. But you can never say no, and you can never say never,” he said. “Maybe we would have fixed it by the first race. Who knows? “It’s sometimes difficult to know how long it’s going to take to fix those things. Plus, I’d never had bouncing like that. "I didn’t expect the guys to take as long. They didn’t expect it to take as long as it’s taken them to understand what’s causing the bouncing. They’ve had to create new tools, all these things we didn’t have before. "You just hold on to hope. And then the next upgrade comes and it doesn’t work, and the next one comes and doesn’t work. Imagine people that are building those things and they are seeing performance in the windtunnel but they are not seeing it on the track. Ah Jesus, you just keep getting knocked back down. “But what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, and we’re still standing tall. It’s not going to be easy to change the car into a leading car for next year but I think we have a much better understanding in why the car is the way it is.” Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes W13 Photo by: Zak Mauger / Motorsport Images While the extreme bouncing of Mercedes has been a key factor in holding Mercedes back, Hamilton says there were several factors at play to explain the lack of performance compared to Ferrari and Red Bull. “It’s been a bunch of different things from the get-go,” he said. “Bouncing was the one that’s most visible. "Stiffness, global stiffness of the car, to the point that the suspension is pretty useless. Stiffer than the tyres. The tyres are then squashing and bouncing, so we’re bouncing on the tyres as well. “And then aero characteristics. Drag is a huge problem for us. When we get past a certain speed that’s when other people are pulling away. “It’s when you brake and the front dips and the rear comes up and the aero transferring during that period and when you get on the power. It’s different between low and high-speed. There are so many problems. “That’s why literally I have tried everything. I’ve tried every setting you can possibly do. That’s what I was doing at the beginning of the year. “The whole idea of performing at your best and getting the best result each weekend, of course that would be nice but I was really about problem solving. So: 'I will sacrifice this session or all the sessions to be able to find more data and information for you.' So that when we go back to the factory they’ve got a better understanding of what’s going on. But it ultimately hindered some of the weekends.” George Russell, Mercedes W13 Photo by: Erik Junius That willingness to experiment over the season also played a part in the dynamics between Hamilton and team-mate George Russell – who enjoyed several stand out qualifying and race performances. Asked about a shift of competitiveness in the team, Hamilton said: “George is doing a great job. I don’t have any problems with it. There’s no issues in the background with us. “George, I would say, and his team, they don’t experiment the same, obviously. But that’s because I’ve been here for a long time, so I’m willing to take these risks. “I have the big, deep conversations with people I’ve been with for 10 years. So, me and Shov [Andrew Shovlin] can have arguments, constructive arguments. “George, it’s his first year with the team so he’s come in and he’s just doing his job to the best of his ability. Very little movement of setup. I’m doing all the leg-work, back and forth here and there, different wings, all these different things and I like that anyway. “If we come into next year and we have a car that we are much happier with, then we can be more focussed on that whole… not having to go crazy with setups. Then we can have a better battle. “If he finishes ahead at the end of the season, I don’t really feel anything about it; we’re not in the championship. We are fourth and sixth. Now, if it was first and second, it’s different.”
Hamilton's contract talks are deserved after he sacrificed season to be Mercedes' guinea pig, https://inews.co.uk/sport/formula-one/lewis-hamilton-contract-talks-f1-2022-season-mercedes-guinea-pig-1937893, Lewis Hamilton turns 38 in January, a time when sport’s cadences ordinarily steer participants towards a natural close. It might have been the case with Hamilton had Abu Dhabi confirmed him as an eight-time world champion. Hamilton would have preferred to have touched down in Mexico in the teeth of yet another championship gale. Hamilton volunteered himself as the guinea pig in the early races while his team-mate George Russell concentrated on assimilating himself into the team. In reality, Hamilton sacrificed himself for the team, enduring all manner of failures as the team disappeared down a succession of set-up rabbit holes., Lewis Hamilton turns 38 in January, a time when sport’s cadences ordinarily steer participants towards a natural close. Sixteen consecutive summers pounding around the circuits of the world would breach the limits of most. It might have been the case with Hamilton had Abu Dhabi confirmed him as an eight-time world champion. Would the incentive to go again have been as great were he alone in the pantheon of champions with eight drivers’ titles? What we do know is last season’s cruel denial coupled with traumas associated with this season’s car have renewed Hamilton’s commitment not shattered it, lit his desire to extend his career into his forties. Hamilton would have preferred to have touched down in Mexico in the teeth of yet another championship gale. Instead, he has used his time to clear out the attic, to spring clean the mental furniture and plan an extended future behind the wheel. “We are going to do another deal. My goal is to continue with Mercedes. I’ve been with Mercedes since I was 13,” Hamilton said. “They’ve stuck with me through thick and thin, through being expelled at school, through everything that was going on through 2020 (Black Lives Matter protests), through my mistakes and s___ that’s been in the press, through the ups and downs. “I’m trying to analyse my next three to five-year plan. It’s difficult to do ten. Where do I see myself? What are the things I want to do? What are my goals? I’m adding in lots of business things, a lot of successful, really positive things outside. “But I want to keep racing. I love what I do. I’ve been doing it for 30 years, and I don’t feel that I should have to stop. I think I’m still earning my keep. I want to do better, still.” Hamilton expects his future to be settled within months. Since the prospect of a race win has receded in 2022 the focus falls on 2023 when Mercedes have pledged to run a car with much altered architecture. Lewis Hamilton has helped George Russell settle into the Mercedes team (Photo: Reuters) Since Canada, when Hamilton gave up trying to experiment his was out of the mess in favour of getting the best out of what he had, his results have picked up. Hamilton volunteered himself as the guinea pig in the early races while his team-mate George Russell concentrated on assimilating himself into the team. The results suggested Russell had the measure of Hamilton encouraging many to connect the events of 2021 with latter’s performance in 2022. In reality, Hamilton sacrificed himself for the team, enduring all manner of failures as the team disappeared down a succession of set-up rabbit holes. In the latter half of the season, Hamilton has outraced his team-mate and outqualified him at the last five grands prix to lead 12-7. “You do all the work in the simulator and the simulator’s telling you something different to what you get at the track,” he said. “You think, the car feels quite good this weekend or the engineers say ‘okay we’ve got an upgrade that’s worth three tenths’ and you get there and it’s a tenth slower. And you’re ‘oh shoot’. I think I’ve learned just not to get my hopes up with anything. It’s better to kind of under-expect and, if it’s just as good it’s just as good, and if it’s better, it’s better.” As hard as Hamilton tries he can never be totally free of the past. Echoes of 2021 have resurfaced through the budget cap fiasco that still awaits resolution following Red Bull’s reported $1.8m (£1.55m) transgression. “That, for sure, brings up a little bit of emotion. You kind of buried it and moved on and then it comes back up, and then it’s like another bit of a kick. That just bought it all kind of fresh again.” How to watch Mexican Grand Prix 2022 TV: Sky Sports holds the right to broadcast all F1 races live in the UK, while Channel 4 shows highlights of both qualifying and the race later in the day.

The link between an offence that took place in 2021 and the Abu Dhabi denouement is all too easy to make, and when put to Hamilton brought unresolved emotions racing to the surface. “It was definitely spirit-breaking, or soul-crushing, whatever you want to call it,” he added. “Just to believe that the sport would do something like that. An outcome of a world championship, which so many people have worked so hard for, would come out through a wrong decision from somebody. “That was probably the only thing. If you can lose a championship through wrongdoing within an organisation. That was the thing that I wondered [about].” The FIA’s supervision of the budget cap has done little to repair trust nor dispel doubts about the competence of F1’s ruling body to govern the sport. Last year’s pledge to build back stronger after Red Bull petitioned race director Michael Masi into making a series of irregular decisions has run into more procedural confusion. The FIA’s insistence on secrecy serves neither governing body, team nor the sport well. Hamilton is not the only one shaking his head.

F1 faces legal challenge over Bahrain contract and sportswashing, https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/oct/27/f1-faces-legal-challenge-over-over-bahrain-contract-and-sportswashing, Yusuf was detained and abused in prison after peaceful criticism of F1 in Bahrain in 2017 and Bird maintains Mansoor was also detained and mistreated at the same time. Bird has been campaigning to ensure F1 sticks to its commitment to respect human rights issues where it holds races. The pressure group says it has received no satisfactory response to its calls for F1 to investigate human rights issues in Bahrain and believes repression around the race has steadily become worse. In February F1 agreed a new deal with Bahrain to host the race until 2036, the longest contract in the sport’s history, sparking Bird to adopt a formal legal approach. The Human Rights Watch group is to publish a report next week entitled: You Can’t Call Bahrain a Democracy: Bahrain’s Political Isolation Laws., Formula One faces a legal complaint accusing it of breaching Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development guidelines after the sport concluded a deal this year extending its contract to hold races in Bahrain until 2036. The complaint, made through the British government’s UK National Contact Point (NCP), which addresses issues of responsible business conduct, has been served by the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (Bird) and two alleged torture survivors from Bahrain, Najah Yusuf and Hajer Mansoor. Yusuf was detained and abused in prison after peaceful criticism of F1 in Bahrain in 2017 and Bird maintains Mansoor was also detained and mistreated at the same time. Bird has been campaigning to ensure F1 sticks to its commitment to respect human rights issues where it holds races. The pressure group says it has received no satisfactory response to its calls for F1 to investigate human rights issues in Bahrain and believes repression around the race has steadily become worse. In February F1 agreed a new deal with Bahrain to host the race until 2036, the longest contract in the sport’s history, sparking Bird to adopt a formal legal approach. The complaint alleges: “Formula One failed to engage with human rights stakeholders including human rights organisations, legislators from across Europe, victims impacted by the Formula One race and those who have faced reprisals for their human rights work.” It accuses F1 of having failed to conduct a due diligence process in assessment of human rights before awarding the new contract and alleges that “forced disappearances, extrajudicial killing and torture” continue to occur in Bahrain. Anti-F1 graffiti in the village of Barbar, west of Manama, the capital of Bahrain, in 2012. Photograph: Hamad I Mohammed/Reuters The complaint specifically accuses F1 of being complicit in sportswashing, noting that the regime has used the event to promote a public display of unity within the kingdom over one of suppression. It alleges that F1 intensifies this oppression, stating: “The race has been responsible for a considerable spike in human rights abuses as the government acts to forestall and suppress protest around the time of the race.” The intent of pursuing legal action through the UK NCP is to force the issue to the OECD, which then may take action against F1. Part of the impetus behind the sport implementing a human rights policy was because of a previous complaint made by the NCP and Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, director of advocacy at Bird, hoped this, too, would provoke action from F1.

We are now escalating the matter by taking it before the UK NCP.” Next year Bahrain is set to hold the opening race of next season and its only pre-season test but criticism of the regime is intensifying. The Human Rights Watch group is to publish a report next week entitled: You Can’t Call Bahrain a Democracy: Bahrain’s Political Isolation Laws. It will document the Bahraini government’s use of political isolation laws and other tactics to keep activists and opposition members out of public office and public life, in what are described as further human rights abuses. “Bahrain has spent the last decade cracking down on peaceful opposition and the political isolation laws are yet another example of the government’s repression expanding into new spheres,” said Joey Shea, Middle East and North Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch. “These draconian laws have made a mockery of Bahrain’s upcoming parliamentary ‘elections’, which can neither be free nor fair when you make any political opposition essentially illegal.” Quick Guide How do I sign up for sport breaking news alerts?

F1 has been approached but is yet to comment on the complaint. However, it has previously stated its position in relation to Bahrain. “We have always been clear with all race promoters and governments with which we deal worldwide that we take violence, abuse of human rights and repression very seriously. “Our human rights policy is very clear and states that the Formula One companies are committed to respecting internationally recognised human rights in its operations globally and have made our position on human rights clear to all our partners and host countries who commit to respect human rights in the way their events are hosted and delivered.”
At U.S. Grand Prix It’s Clear F1 Has Its Foot on the Gas in the States, https://www.si.com/formula1/2022/10/27/us-grand-prix-formula-1-future-circuit-of-the-americas, An increasing number of races in the U.S. and a likely new American driver are feeding a steadily growing fanbase in the country. But despite being at the pinnacle of their sport, drivers remember walking around in the U.S. and going largely unnoticed. Netflix’s Drive to Survive was first released in March 2019, and it gained even more momentum during the pandemic lockdown. And I think there’s a culture in the U.S. also to make the sport a show. Williams team boss Jost Capito confirmed on Saturday that as long as Logan Sargeant has the necessary points for his Super License, the Florida native will be the team’s second F1 driver in 2023., An increasing number of races in the U.S. and a likely new American driver are feeding a steadily growing fanbase in the country. AUSTIN—The ruckus of Formula One fans within the grandstands at Circuit of the Americas threatened to overpower the roar of the cars as they readied for the start of the 2022 U.S. Grand Prix on Sunday, As the lights went out, the cars sped off, tight battles for positions forming as the 20 drivers barreled up a massive hill to Turn 1. A massive American flag loomed overhead as George Russell spun Carlos Sainz, groans echoing from spectators as the Ferrari driver’s day came to an end. Given the environment around the 3.4-mile track, it’s hard to imagine that the drivers’ championship was decided the prior race in Japan. A record-breaking 440,000 fans flooded the complex throughout the four-day weekend, marking the highest attendance this season—The Australian Grand Prix was the closest in 2022 with 420,000 spectators, and while the race day attendance numbers have not been confirmed yet at COTA, it’s likely to have exceeded Silverstone’s 142,000. The likes of Ed Sheeran, Serena Williams, Shaq and Brad Pitt (who is starring in an upcoming F1-themed movie) were among the star-studded names in the COTA paddock this weekend. It’s hard to believe that just a few seasons ago only 265,000 fans filled COTA during 2018’s race weekend. But Lewis Hamilton feels F1 has “finally tapped into the country.” “At the end of the day, there’s 20 drivers that are athletes, that are putting their life on the line, weekend in, weekend out,” Hamilton said. “And unlike the other sports, which are also exciting, there's a lot of players … In terms of athletes, there’s only 20 of us so it’s a very, very small group of us that get to drive these rockets basically around so we’re as close to NASA, I guess, as we can be.” Formula One moved the United States Grand Prix to Circuit of the Americas beginning in 2012 and only missed a single season in the last decade, which was because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But despite being at the pinnacle of their sport, drivers remember walking around in the U.S. and going largely unnoticed. That is until F1’s big boom happened. Netflix’s Drive to Survive was first released in March 2019, and it gained even more momentum during the pandemic lockdown. Even Red Bull driver Max Verstappen, who has been critical of the show in the past, acknowledged its importance, saying, “Up until a few years ago, the sport was very closed. You couldn’t really get close to the teams. Everything is opening up a little bit more. And then, because of Netflix giving a bit more insight, you start to understand a little bit more of what’s going on and you don’t just see the cars driving around. That’s why people are a lot more excited about Formula One now.” Coupled with the rise of TikTok and F1 content creators as well as a broadcast deal with ESPN, there’s more access to the sport for American viewers than ever before, and it’s coincided with the increase in popularity. “It’s incredible to see the progression from the first year I’ve been here, in 2018, to now. The sport has grown massively in the U.S., so much more people in Austin, much more difficult to go around the city easily,” Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc said after a third-place finish. “But it’s a good sign. And I think there’s a culture in the U.S. also to make the sport a show. And this is really the way I see it now. And there’s a challenge of keeping the DNA of the sport, adding the show, and I think this has been done extremely well. I can’t wait to see what was going to happen in Vegas next year, which will probably be crazy.” The sport added the Miami Grand Prix to the schedule this season, and beginning next year, there will be three United States-based races with the Las Vegas Grand Prix taking place in November 2023. There’s no doubt the sport is booming in the States, but the question is whether it’s a flash-in-the-pan moment or a new era of sports for American fans. The introduction of a home driver could only add to the growing excitement. Williams team boss Jost Capito confirmed on Saturday that as long as Logan Sargeant has the necessary points for his Super License, the Florida native will be the team’s second F1 driver in 2023. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner explained Saturday how critical a move like this is for the sport. “I think we see the growth in the U.S., we see the excitement that there is. I came from Vegas earlier in the week and seeing the plans there for that race as well, which looks to be an epic event, you can see the American public are really engaged in Formula One, and I think we need an American driver,” Horner said. “Not only just a driver, we need a successful driver in there competing as well. It shouldn't just be Brad Pitt. So I think that, it’s exciting for Formula One, it's exciting times and the sport’s growing and developing. And I think we'll see more American talent developing and emerging. Certainly we’ve got some interesting candidates on our junior program that we’re investing in.” Sargeant could be the current face of Formula One in the U.S. Erick W. Rasco/Sports Illustrated Sargeant is third in the standings with one round left on the F2 calendar, but two more F1 practice sessions with Williams this season could help soften the buffer. Drivers get an extra point for exceeding 100 km, which he did during first practice in Texas this weekend. If it all goes to plan after Abu Dhabi, Sergeant will be the first American on the F1 grid since Alexander Rossi in 2015. Sergeant got his start with karting at just six years old, but he describes that it was a “hobby” at the time, something fun during the weekends. However, after that, “everything just escalated very quickly.” Although there are options like NASCAR and IndyCar here in the States, Sergeant decided to dive into European racing, making the move across the pond at 12 years old. “I was still young at the time. So I had a push from behind as well, which is sometimes what you need,” Sergeant says as he reflects on that major decision to move to Europe. “And you’re also a bit ... oblivious to how big of a jump it is and how big of a deal [and] commitment it is. But I think that was the best way it could be. And yeah, I think to get to Formula One you needed to make that jump to Europe. The path through America to get to F1 is extremely difficult.” He’s lived on his own since 17, now residing in London as he competes for Carlin in F2. At first, the British city “was not quite to [his] taste,” but it has grown on him over the years. Just not so much the weather. Although the announcement of his tentative F1 debut came a day after his first practice session, Sergeant says that moment had been months in the works. He won back-to-back F2 feature races at Silverstone and Spielberg, Austria, and midseason is when he realized his F1 dream could be a reality. “[In] the middle of season, we started to really pick up on some good results, start getting some wins, some pole positions, and everything was just flowing very nicely,” he says. “The performance was obviously there, and that's sort of where my expectations sort of shifted—to constantly be at the front and fighting for wins and podiums. And that's sort of where it took a turn.” Watching Sargeant during Friday’s first practice, it is hard to tell that he is just in his rookie F2 season. He may have finished 19th, but he recorded 23 trouble-free laps. And he says the session “was everything I expected, plus a lot more.” The 21-year-old did anticipate “everything to be extremely quick. “The high-speed sector one was definitely an eye opener, how much speed that the cars are capable of carrying as well as how effective the brakes are, compared to what I’m used to in Formula Two,” Sargeant said. “And I just didn't think that the gap between the two series would be quite as big as it was.” Sergeant remembers watching the battle between Felipe Massa and Hamilton for the title in 2008, and while watching the F1 greats of the years, he asks, “Who doesn't want to be one of them?” He’s noticed the shift within America as Formula One became more popular in recent years, adding that his friends showed little interest years ago, but now constantly pepper him with questions. America does have a home team in Haas, but adding a U.S. native driver signifies the growth that continues to come for F1. “For America, I think they need a driver to root for,” Sargeant says. “And I will do my best to, hopefully, be someone they all like and appreciate. But I feel like from an American driver’s point of view, I hope it just gives young drivers that belief to make that step to Europe and to make that sacrifice, that if you do work hard that it all will work out.” More Racing Coverage:

Ricciardo has been comprehensively outperformed by his McLaren team-mate Lando Norris since he switched from Renault to McLaren in 2021., “If Daniel decides to have one year off, from experience I know once you leave this sport normally you shouldn’t come back.” Few people are better placed to talk about Formula 1 drivers taking sabbaticals than two-time F1 world champion Mika Hakkinen. ﻿ After winning back-to-back titles with McLaren, Hakkinen narrowly lost out on a third F1 title in 2000 to Michael Schumacher and then was powerless to stop Schumacher from romping to the crown in 2001 in dominant fashion. That led to Hakkinen’s decision to take a sabbatical from F1 at the end of 2001 which would turn into a fully-fledged retirement as he never returned to racing in F1 again. ‘Choosing to laugh as I don’t want to cry’ – Ricciardo’s US GP Read more Outgoing McLaren driver Daniel Ricciardo has revealed he’ll spend 2023 on the sidelines but has emphasised his desire to return to F1 in 2024 if he can find the right project. Comparisons have been drawn between Hakkinen and Ricciardo but there are key differences as the two-time F1 champion points out to Edd Straw on the new ‘Flat Out with Mika Hakkinen’ section of The Race F1 Podcast. “I think my position was a little bit different because I was already a two-time world champion, I’d achieved my goals,” Hakkinen said. “Daniel has a different situation. His performance has been dropping, he’s not going flat-out there. So people are not sure with him if he’s quick enough. “That could make it difficult having a year off and coming back because if you’re not quick enough, there’s always some kind of explanation, some reason. “And I feel he’s not giving this information very clearly to media, to fans, to the team. That’s a bit scary, you have to know why I’m not able to maximise my performance to the same level as my team-mate.” Then-McLaren boss Ron Dennis convinced Hakkinen to make his retirement announcement a sabbatical plan at the end of 2001, but the Finn revealed that early in 2002 he knew he wasn’t going to return to racing in F1. “I thought ‘OK if you feel like it I’d appreciate it, I will see what happens’,” Hakkinen said of his decision to announce a sabbatical rather than a retirement. “But I did recognise after three-four months, when the season [2002] started and I was in Monaco or wherever I was, I was definitely feeling like ‘no way I wanted to go back there’. “It requires so much energy, so much power from your body and physiologically, a lot of energy. I knew that way it doesn’t matter if I have one year off, I cannot come back. I already knew that halfway through the season that I’m not coming back. “If Daniel decides to have one year off, from experience I know once you leave this sport normally you shouldn’t come back. You can’t perform out there while thinking ‘should I retire or not’. [You have to] go flat-out every second.” More from Mika Hakkinen on Amp Want more F1?

Ricciardo has been comprehensively outperformed by his McLaren team-mate Lando Norris since he switched from Renault to McLaren in 2021. Ricciardo gives update on 2023 F1 reserve role chances Read more The Australian has scored just 21% of the team’s points this season, struggling to adapt to McLaren’s 2022 car and unable to consistently drive it in the way Norris does. “It’s definitely not easy,” Hakkinen said of Ricciardo’s situation. “When I was racing we had a lot of testing, we were testing those cars constantly. “The car was tailor-made for you and now the cars are not really tailor-made for you because you are not allowed to do testing. “So the engineers have to do a lot of calculations, back in the factory to build the car for the coming season. “If the driver complains during the weekend of some driving balance problem with the car, they can change the springs, the aerodynamic, the differential, the braking balance, tyre pressures, but they are also quite limited these days what you’re allowed to change. “The things you can do are very little. And if you do have a driving style which is aggressive in the entry, then you need to build the set-up in a way the car still handles nicely in mid-corner and exit. “But if you cannot change the geometries of the front suspension or rear suspension, it makes your life really complicated, that means you have to adapt for this issue. “Adapting your driving style if the car doesn’t work, it’s awful. It’s not fun at all but if your team-mate can do it, then you can do it too.” Hakkinen called Ricciardo a “great character” and expressed his hope that the McLaren driver can turn things around and continue in F1 in 2024. But he also highlighted the risky moves Ricciardo has made during his career, having first left Red Bull for Renault at the end of 2018 and then switched to McLaren two years later. Hakkinen in contrast joined McLaren in 1993 (pictured above) after spending his first two years in F1 with Team Lotus and remained at McLaren until his retirement at the end of 2001. “I joined McLaren, a team with an unbelievable history,” Hakkinen explained.

This long-term, people learn who you are, you learn the engineers. “They learn to understand your driving technique, and they know long-term what you need to have a car to win. “And I think Daniel changed his team quite often, Red Bull, Renault, McLaren and changing teams, I always think it’s a risk. “People learn to know who you are, but understanding what is your driving technique, not so simple to see that, to explain that. “To do that requires a long time.”

The compromises involved in delivering optimal F1 ride quality, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/the-compromises-involved-in-delivering-optimal-f1-ride-quality/10390795/, The term ‘ride quality’ is more generally associated with luxury saloon cars than with Formula 1 machinery but, in its own way, it’s equally important to any form of competition car. To understand why, we first have to ask what we mean by ride quality. Any vehicle travelling over bumps in a road will experience a vertical force as it traverses those bumps. Some of that force will deflect the tyre sidewall and some will be passed through the wheel to the suspension, where again some deflection will take place. Finally some force will act on the chassis and the driver., The term ‘ride quality’ is more generally associated with luxury saloon cars than with Formula 1 machinery but, in its own way, it’s equally important to any form of competition car.

Vettel: Upcoming F1 retirement "getting a little bit more real", https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/vettel-upcoming-f1-retirement-getting-a-little-bit-more-real/10390975/, For Vettel, the reality of leaving F1 is gradually starting to sink as he counts down the races to his last outing in Abu Dhabi. "It is getting a little bit more real," Vettel said before the US Grand Prix. "At Suzuka, I was a bit sad after qualifying and Sunday was a little bit up and down and mixed emotions because the race was so different. It's a special place and I will miss it. It is a special place to me.", Listen to this article In the summer, Vettel announced he would call time on a 15-year F1 career, which yielded four world championships, as his current contract with Aston Martin runs out at the end of the season. For Vettel, the reality of leaving F1 is gradually starting to sink as he counts down the races to his last outing in Abu Dhabi. The German was visibly emotional after saying goodbye to his favourite track at Suzuka. And last week in Austin he admitted he would "miss the adrenaline" from fighting wheel to wheel as he did with Haas' Kevin Magnussen on the final lap. "It is getting a little bit more real," Vettel said before the US Grand Prix. "At Suzuka, I was a bit sad after qualifying and Sunday was a little bit up and down and mixed emotions because the race was so different. It's a special place and I will miss it. "I don't know how Abu Dhabi will be. Obviously, from a results point of view I don't think we expect miracles all of a sudden, but I also tend to look forward to what's next. Sebastian Vettel, Aston Martin AMR22 Photo by: Erik Junius "I'm excited about what's coming, it's not like I completely hate Formula 1 now and I'm happy to get out, but obviously I made the decision and look forward to what's coming." While the US Grand Prix might not rank as high as Japan on Vettel's all-time list, it too holds a special place as he made his debut at the 2007 edition at Indianapolis, taking a point in eighth for BMW Sauber. "Yeah absolutely. I think in the end is a great place to come. Obviously, my first race was in Indy, so it has a special place," the 35-year-old explained after battling to eight at his final US GP, which became seventh after a time penalty for Alpine's Fernando Alonso. "I kept the one-cent coin that I found on the Sunday morning in Indianapolis while I was running, and it's still with me. It is a special place to me."

Toto Wolff has Audi "on his radar" for 2026 Formula 1 success, https://www.planetf1.com/news/toto-wolff-audi-radar-2026-success/, Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff has said he is wary of Audi’s competitiveness right from the moment they will enter Formula 1 in 2026. Formal confirmation of that deal has now come, with Sauber operating as Audi’s official factory entry from 2026 onwards. “I would never underestimate the VW Group (parent company of Audi),” said Wolff, quoted by Motorsport-Total. However, their entry in 2026 will rekindle a Mercedes/Auto Union rivalry that dates back to pre-World War II grand prix racing. “It is great news to hear Audi will have a partnership with Sauber for their entry into Formula 1 in 2026,” he said., Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff has said he is wary of Audi’s competitiveness right from the moment they will enter Formula 1 in 2026. Having previously announced their intent to arrive in Formula 1 in 2026, the nature of Audi’s entry has now been made clear as the German manufacturer revealed a partnership with Sauber Motorsport – the team currently operating the Alfa Romeo F1 entry. The same day Audi announced their F1 entry, Alfa Romeo confirmed their partnership with Sauber would come to a close at the end of 2023 – leaving little doubt Audi and Sauber were set to pair up. Formal confirmation of that deal has now come, with Sauber operating as Audi’s official factory entry from 2026 onwards. They will continue as Alfa Romeo until the end of next year before reverting to Sauber, with Ferrari power units, until the end of 2025. Toto Wolff “won’t underestimate the VW Group” Wolff, who also heads up Mercedes’ motorsport programme, has earmarked Audi to do well and hit the ground running in 2026 – even if the task ahead looks huge. “I would never underestimate the VW Group (parent company of Audi),” said Wolff, quoted by Motorsport-Total. “I have them absolutely on the radar. They are one of the teams that could be successful in 2026.” Audi and Mercedes are long-time rivals on the domestic front due to their battles in the DTM series, but Audi have never competed in the Formula 1 World Championship. However, their entry in 2026 will rekindle a Mercedes/Auto Union rivalry that dates back to pre-World War II grand prix racing. While that historic rivalry has no relevance to modern-day motorsport, Wolff said the overall expertise of the Volkswagen Group will enable Audi to flourish as he highlighted “the financial strength, knowhow and motorsport expertise to get a great project off the ground, and I think the marriage with Sauber is one that fits”. Wolff also pointed out the legal framework in Hinwil, a German-speaking region of Switzerland, is similar to that in Germany – which means a cultural clash is unlikely to occur between the two parties. F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali thrilled by Audi’s arrival Formula 1 CEO Stefano Domenicali also welcomed the news of Audi’s arrival, saying it is an “exciting prospect” for F1 as a new, prominent manufacturer signs up to race. “It is great news to hear Audi will have a partnership with Sauber for their entry into Formula 1 in 2026,” he said. “The combination of those two names is a very exciting prospect for our sport. “It highlights the strong momentum Formula 1 has and the belief in our strategy to further grow and enhance the sport while delivering on our sustainability plans to be Net Zero Carbon by 2030 with advanced sustainable fuels in the cars in 2026. “We look forward to seeing their progress over the coming years and the car on the grid for the team’s first race.” Read More: Sauber to compete as Audi factory team from 2026 as partnership confirmed

READ MORE: 6 Winners and 5 Losers from the United States Grand Prix - Who got the crowd on their feet in Austin? The altitude makes it a tough race for the cars, but the fans will be out in force, From one epic crowd to another, the final three races of the season are upon us but there’s still plenty to play for, and an on-track dispute rolling on between two teams. So here are some of the stories we think will have everyone talking this weekend in Mexico City… 1. Verstappen chasing a record The United States Grand Prix was another thrilling race that saw three teams fighting it out for the win, but once again it was Max Verstappen who came out on top as he has done so often this year. READ MORE: Verstappen ties Schumacher and Vettel’s record 13 wins in a season – facts and stats from Texas In fact, he has done it so many times that Verstappen is on the verge of setting a new Formula 1 record this weekend in Mexico, as he goes in search of his 14th victory of the season. No driver has ever won more than 13 in one campaign, with the Dutchman now level with Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel. While Verstappen is modest when it comes to the potential record as he rightly points out there are more races this season than in any of the years that the two German drivers managed 13 wins, he has achieved the feat in the same number of races that Vettel did – 19 – and just one more than Schumacher managed in 2004. That means if he wins in Mexico, he will have a better win percentage than Vettel had in 2013, and he can even better Schumacher’s percentage too this season, although that requires him to win all three of the remaining races. 2022 United States Grand Prix: Red Bull celebrate constructors’ title as Verstappen takes victory 2. Checo-mania as the fight for P2 hots up As much as Verstappen has been the Red Bull leader this season, there’s no denying that it would be a massively popular result for the team if it was the other driver who took victory in Mexico. That’s because Sergio Perez enjoys enormous support from his home crowd, who created an incredible atmosphere a year ago (as they do every year) when he stood on the podium for the first time. READ MORE: 6 Winners and 5 Losers from the United States Grand Prix - Who got the crowd on their feet in Austin? On that occasion, he was chasing down Lewis Hamilton for second but had to settle for third place, and he’ll be hoping to go two better this time around. It’s important for Perez not only in the context of it being his home race but also because he’s locked in a thrilling battle with Charles Leclerc for second in the drivers’ championship. Leclerc moved two points ahead of the Mexican with a fifth podium in a row in Austin on Sunday, as the fight looks set to go right to the wire. Perez's podium was a massively popular result last time out in Mexico 3. Mercedes getting closer Leclerc had to settle for third despite finding himself in a strong position at Circuit of the Americas, when a well-timed Safety Car allowed him to make a pit stop and emerge in fourth place – behind Perez at the time – after just 18 laps despite a grid penalty that saw him start down in P12. While it was perhaps not a surprise to see Verstappen have the pace to beat Leclerc, Lewis Hamilton would have been Ferrari’s target, but Mercedes had the upper hand in race trim. TECH TUESDAY: Why Mercedes' experimental front wing caused a stir in Texas Hamilton drove an excellent race and kept Verstappen honest throughout as a number of the new Mercedes upgrades introduced in Austin helped close the gap a little further to the top two teams. George Russell also had the pace to set the fastest lap on soft tyres late on, albeit having seen his hopes of the podium disappear due to causing a collision with Carlos Sainz at the start. Mercedes still seem to lack that final bit of performance that would make them favourites for a win anywhere, but their form fluctuates from track to track and it feels like they’re now in a position where they have a car good enough to capitalise when they find a circuit suits them. Hamilton pushed Verstappen hard for the win in Austin 4. The challenge of the altitude Whether Mexico will provide that opportunity for Mercedes remains to be seen, as we head back to the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez and the unique challenge that it provides. The track is the highest of the season by some margin, located at more than 2,200 metres above sea level, some 1,400 metres higher than the next track on that list at Interlagos. And at that altitude, the air is less dense, so cooling is an issue that the teams have to get their heads around. F1 NATION PODCAST: A bumper episode as Red Bull celebrate their fifth constructors' title with Texas win Items such as the power unit and brakes need extra attention as they can become tougher to cool down, while the less dense air also impacts both power unit performance and the level of downforce that is being generated by the cars. A simple way of thinking about it is that even when the cars are at their highest downforce setting – the same as they use in Monaco – they are only getting downforce levels more akin to Monza, where they run their lowest settings. The altitude makes it a tough race for the cars, but the fans will be out in force

Then came the collision that changed his race, as the two-time champion was caught off-guard by the jinking Aston Martin of Stroll. But after contact with the barriers, followed by a pit stop, amazingly Alonso came back into the race and powered on in a trademark display of his indefatigability, and finished in the points – before a 30-second penalty dropped him down to P15.

It looked like it was going to be a painful weekend for Haas when in qualifying Mick Schumacher spun on his final Q1 lap and Magnussen struggled for pace, taking 16th on the grid. The Danish driver backed himself on Sunday though – Magnussen was the only driver to pull off a one-stopper – and found himself running up in the points.

I Watched Two Episodes of 'Drive to Survive' and Then Covered Formula 1, https://www.texasmonthly.com/arts-entertainment/formula-one-us-grand-prix-report/, The traffic chaos is just one part of the hullabaloo accompanying a Grand Prix weekend. Popular Videos Previous Next moreThe Grand Prix has been hosted at COTA since 2012, but this was my first time attending anything associated with it. So when Ferrari Trento offered me, of all people, a ticket for Sunday, it seemed too good to pass up. Alex Bierens de Haan/GettyEverybody in the Paddock Club was covered in lanyards, and there was a seemingly endless tier system of very important Very Important Person passes. For the most part, my experience of the U.S. Grand Prix remained primarily aural., Formula 1 is famous as a sport where cars go super-duper fast, but most of the vehicles at the United States Grand Prix move at a crawl. Every pickup, limousine, van, and shuttle that buses attendees to and from the Circuit of the Americas endures truly horrific traffic to do so. Unless you’re among the richest and most famous tier of spectators, who arrive and depart by chartered helicopter, your eighteen-mile trip back to downtown Austin at the end of any one of the event’s three days of activities will take hours. The shuttle I rode back and forth from last weekend’s race was not immune to the standstill. We were a motley crew of journalists, alcohol executives, and other guests of the Italian spirits company Ferrari Trento (no relation to the automaker), which makes the “Official Sparkling Wine of Formula 1,” a.k.a. the celebratory bubbly that gets sprayed all over the winners. It took two hours to drive back from the Circuit of the Americas to the Hyatt on Barton Springs. The Swedish guy across the aisle from me managed to take a nap, and wake up refreshed from said nap, all before we got out of the parking lot. The traffic chaos is just one part of the hullabaloo accompanying a Grand Prix weekend. Like a multibillion-dollar traveling circus, Formula 1 moves around the globe just as P. T. Barnum and company once toured America. Between the cars, the tools, the tents, and all the other race ephemera, F1 ships an estimated fifty tons of cargo from one Grand Prix to the next. Even the VIP experiences at the Paddock and Champions clubs are standard, no matter the racetrack. You’ll see the same catering and host staff in Austin that you do in Miami—and Monaco. Trailing behind the official Formula 1 freight and faculty is a tangled web of brands seeking to capitalize on the crowds attending the races. Though this year’s U.S. Grand Prix was held almost twenty miles outside of downtown Austin, there were activations, parties, and concerts all over the city, each with varying levels of exclusivity and different celebrities to help set the mood. I saw Tom Sandoval, a bartender from the reality show Vanderpump Rules (a.k.a. one of “the Toms”) three separate times over the course of as many days. I watched him strut into the bathroom at the racetrack; I saw him get his photo taken next to bottles of Patrón at a pool party sponsored by the tequila company; and I watched him sing karaoke with a live band on the rooftop deck of a members-only club called Soho House. Popular Videos Previous Next more The Grand Prix has been hosted at COTA since 2012, but this was my first time attending anything associated with it. The only sport I’ve ever really followed is RuPaul’s Drag Race, but my interest in Formula 1 had recently been piqued by the same thing that once got me to care about the Texas Rangers: a crush on a guy who was a big fan. The sport has always been popular in Europe, but thanks to a Netflix docuseries called Drive to Survive, it is finally having a moment stateside. At least that’s what all the sports people in my life were telling me. So when Ferrari Trento offered me, of all people, a ticket for Sunday, it seemed too good to pass up. In preparation for my day at the races, I watched almost two full episodes of the docuseries and studied the Formula 1 Wikipedia page (I also googled “what to wear to F1?” multiple times). I arrived at COTA patting myself on the back for knowing that Max Verstappen, who drives for Red Bull, had already clinched this year’s world championship. I also knew that seven-time champ Lewis Hamilton hadn’t finished first in a single race this season. He drove for Mercedes, which had long been the team to beat because it had the best cars. But then F1 implemented a cap on team spending and changed car regulations, and now Red Bull was at the top. I had decided I would “root” for Sergio “Checo” Pérez, because he is from Mexico. I was practically an expert. On Sunday, we arrived an hour and a half early for the 2 p.m. race—enough time for me to get the lay of the land before hearing the engines roar (an experience I was assured would be thrilling, even for me). We were given lanyards with rectangular credentials that had the heft and feel of high-limit credit cards. These passes gave us access to two venues, the standard Paddock Club by the starting line, and the Paddock Club at Turn 19, where guests could dine on Chilean sea bass and côte de boeuf while toasting from one of the 20,000 bottles of Ferrari Trento sparkling wine that were enjoyed throughout F1 weekend. Even though we were in semirural Texas, it felt at times like we had been transported to Europe. The tent we were in had EU power outlets, and the main Paddock Club had all-you-can-eat Kaiserschmarrn, basically the Austrian version of a funnel cake, which is the height of luxury as far as I’m concerned. And in perhaps the truest continental touch, not only were there numerous outdoor smoking sections in plain sight, even close to the fanciest VIP areas, but the smokers gathered on actual red carpets under their big, industrial ashtrays. It was beautiful. Lewis Hamilton, Max Verstappen, and Charles Leclerc spraying Ferrari Trento after the race. Courtesy of Ferrari Trento Shaq visits Williams Racing. Alex Bierens de Haan/Getty Everybody in the Paddock Club was covered in lanyards, and there was a seemingly endless tier system of very important Very Important Person passes. My credential couldn’t get me very far, which meant I had no hope of mingling with Shaq down on the paddock’s ground level, near the garages. For a moment, I did spot him from a distance before the race started, and I could hear him deejaying afterward. Scattered throughout the other thousand or so acres at COTA were tents from ever more brands, from Alfa Romeo to Lenovo. One tent—on top of a hill overlooking Turn 1—gave fans a clear view of the crash that happened ten seconds into the race, when front-runner Carlos Sainz was knocked off the track by George Russell (nobody was hurt). I didn’t see that crash. My seat at the Paddock only gave me a view of the starting line. But I knew it happened because I heard 100,000 fans switch from shouting “yeah” to “ewww” in a millisecond.  I’ll tell ya what, in that moment I learned a lot more about the appeal of F1 than I did from those episodes of Drive to Survive. I know it’s a sport that people watch, but man, what a thing to hear. Every time the sound of those engines hit my ears—with the race cars flying by at more than two hundred miles per hour—it sent through my body an immediate and involuntary need to party. One more serving of Kaiserschmarrn, dear sir! For the most part, my experience of the U.S. Grand Prix remained primarily aural. There was another, more serious collision that I didn’t see, and fortunately, both drivers once again emerged more or less unscathed. I missed that one while riding a golf cart to Club Cash App, where my invitation promised a chance to mingle with celebrities as disparate as Serena Williams and Brooklyn Beckham, David and Victoria’s oldest son. I was on the golf cart because it was a two-mile walk from the Paddock Club to Club Cash App’s tent—a distance I was able to confirm later, when I couldn’t get any of the ten or so golf carts outside Club Cash App to bring me back. (They had all been reserved for the celebrities as varied as Serena Williams and Brooklyn Beckham, it turned out.) Having stretched my VIP lanyard as far as it would go, I wandered back toward the Paddock Club through general admission, where thousands of happy attendees sat on bleachers or grassy hilltops overlooking the race. A Ferris wheel, a convoy of food trucks, and a slew of regular funnel cake vendors helped turn EuroTexas back into Texas, Texas, and made the Grand Prix feel more like a rodeo or county fair. By the time I made it through GA, I’d all but decided that Formula 1 should add a livestock show to its Austin festivities. As I drew closer to some signs identifying Turn 19, I found myself thinking that the walk hadn’t been bad at all, and that’s when I figured out that I was at the same turn but on the wrong side of the track. The Circuit of the Americas was built with no regard for pedestrian crosswalks or underpasses, so I had to trek another mile and a half (past the front gate, through one tunnel, and behind the Shaq-only zone) to get back to the Paddock Club. I didn’t see the race end, but I heard it when the crowd roared for Max Verstappen, who picked up his thirteenth win of the season. Minutes later, I passed a crowd barreling onto the track for the customary post-race “track invasion.” Had I not been running late for the shuttle, I might have run with them. I don’t care about sports, but I love sports fans. Feeling like I might have wasted my one opportunity to have an exclusive F1 experience (unless Club Cash App invites me back, I will never be able to afford a VIP package), I arrived sheepishly back at the Paddock Club in time to eat some chilled chocolate fondant with sea-salt caramel and some homemade mint parfait before the caterers closed up shop. Together with the other last-callers, I walked one more mile back to the parking lot. Along the way, we passed a merchandise tent engaged in price-gouging that’d make even Beyoncé blush: $80 for branded F1 baseball caps and $130 for team jerseys. It took a comically long time to find our shuttle in the parking lot full of identical shuttles. We were supposed to meet at zone A7, but it turned out there was more than one A7, or we were supposed to be at A6, or something. I still don’t understand what happened, but we eventually boarded the correct shuttle, joining the rest of the Ferrari Trento guests, who were handing out snacks and popping more bottles of official F1 bubbly. The Swedish gentleman across the aisle told me his barbecue-flavored potato chips were better than he expected, before he settled down for his nap. When our chariot finally dropped us off at the Hyatt, we’d spent as much time traveling eighteen miles as Max Verstappen, Lewis Hamilton, and Sergio “Checo” Pérez spent driving 3,426 miles in 56 laps around the Circuit of the Americas.
Mercedes plans to race controversial new F1 front wing in Mexico, https://the-race.com/formula-1/mercedes-plans-to-race-controversial-new-f1-front-wing-in-mexico/, Mercedes is planning to race with a new front wing on its 2022 Formula 1 car at the Mexico Grand Prix – a wing which raised eyebrows when first revealed in Austin last weekend. The team publicly displayed a new wing for the W13 at the United States GP as part of a wider upgrade package but didn’t run the wing detail all weekend. But Mercedes Formula 1 technical director Mike Elliott said it was always the plan to not run the wing as the team didn’t have enough copies of it for both drivers to run the update. Mercedes says the fasteners on the wing are there to keep it together while the counterargument is that their distribution is deliberate for aerodynamic gain. Gary Anderson: Mercedes’ wing upgrade exploits a grey area Read more“That is our last major update but there are always a string of new parts, smaller parts, that we are looking at,” Shovlin added., Mercedes is planning to race with a new front wing on its 2022 Formula 1 car at the Mexico Grand Prix – a wing which raised eyebrows when first revealed in Austin last weekend. The team publicly displayed a new wing for the W13 at the United States GP as part of a wider upgrade package but didn’t run the wing detail all weekend. This followed question marks being raised over the legality of the specially shaped fasteners between the two upper flaps that led to an “exchange” with the FIA. But Mercedes Formula 1 technical director Mike Elliott said it was always the plan to not run the wing as the team didn’t have enough copies of it for both drivers to run the update. Mercedes: Arguing new wing detail probably not worth the risk Read more Elliott said he was unsure whether Mercedes would run the new front wing detail during the three remaining races in 2022 because of the risk of it being found illegal when it only provides a marginal performance improvement. “Personally, I think we could argue them,” Elliott said in Austin. “But the question becomes whether we want to or not. “The gain for those bits is so small, is it worth the risk of falling foul of the stewards?” The legality question marks centre around what the primary purpose of the design is. Mercedes says the fasteners on the wing are there to keep it together while the counterargument is that their distribution is deliberate for aerodynamic gain. “The reason we didn’t run it in Austin was that we only had one of those parts,” trackside engineering director Andrew Shovlin said in the team’s regular race debrief YouTube video. Mercedes front wing may need tweaking after FIA ‘exchange’ Read more “So, if we damaged it during qualifying it would have meant the car that damaged the wing had to start from the back. “Also with a very busy programme, we had the tyre test in FP2, we didn’t actually have time to evaluate. “We have more of those parts available in Mexico, we will run that on the Friday, we’ll check it’s all working as expected, and the plan at this stage is to race that wing.” Shovlin confirmed that while Austin’s upgrade marked the final major development of the season, the team will still make changes to the W13 during the final three races. Gary Anderson: Mercedes’ wing upgrade exploits a grey area Read more “That is our last major update but there are always a string of new parts, smaller parts, that we are looking at,” Shovlin added. “Either to get a small gain in performance, [or] at a lot of it as this stage of the year though is learning for next year, so some of those test parts are really just trying to understand some of the development direction we want to go in. “So like I said, it’s the last major update, but it won’t be the last change to the car.” As well as attempting to gather data for when it – according to team boss Toto Wolff – changes the “DNA” of its car next year, Mercedes is also trying to save itself from its first win-less F1 season since 2011.
This Is How America Could Get Its Next Formula 1 Driver, https://jalopnik.com/this-is-how-america-could-get-its-next-formula-1-driver-1849691412, This year, Formula 1 has been close to securing an American driver for the first time since 2015, but countless issues have risen to the fore to keep that from happening. He just needs a few more super license points. Plenty of folks have become very familiar with F1's super license system this year thanks to rumors about IndyCar driver Colton Herta becoming a top pick for the AlphaTauri team’s second seat. Essentially, a super license is a way for drivers to be recognized as capable of competing at the F1 level. Sargeant, on the other hand, is extremely close to securing the necessary 40 points required for a super license., This year, Formula 1 has been close to securing an American driver for the first time since 2015, but countless issues have risen to the fore to keep that from happening. But over the United States Grand Prix weekend, Williams team principal Jost Capito confirmed that the team is fully prepared to sign Logan Sargeant alongside Alex Albon for 2023. He just needs a few more super license points. Plenty of folks have become very familiar with F1's super license system this year thanks to rumors about IndyCar driver Colton Herta becoming a top pick for the AlphaTauri team’s second seat. Essentially, a super license is a way for drivers to be recognized as capable of competing at the F1 level. You can read more about the requirements here, but to put it quite simply, Herta was nowhere near having enough points, largely due to the way IndyCar is weighted. Sargeant, on the other hand, is extremely close to securing the necessary 40 points required for a super license. As it currently stands, Sargeant is third in the Formula 2 standings. If he remains there, he’ll secure a super license. He’ll secure a super license even if he finishes fifth in the standings. If he finishes sixth in F2, he’ll be two points short of a super license, but he can nab both of them by completing the race season without any penalty points. Advertisement “Yeah, we feel he’s ready to race. Under the condition that he has enough super license points after Abu Dhabi, he will be our second driver next year,” Capito said during the team principal press conference at the United States Grand Prix. He continued, as per Formula 1: “He’s had one season in F2, and I’m a fan of getting young drivers as quick through as possible into Formula 1 because the series below, the cars compare to Formula 1 cars… so get him in as quick as possible and find out if he’s capable of staying in Formula 1 for a long time, which we believe he is. “And his first year in F2, and he won races, and he has been qualifying very strong all these years in his career — and we believe he’s absolutely ready to get into Formula 1.” G/O Media may get a commission 10% off 10% off Wish A gift for literally everybody.

A grid drop saw him start outside the top 10, but Alonso pounced on the Safety Car to pit. Then came the collision that changed his race, as the two-time champion was caught off-guard by the jinking Aston Martin of Stroll. But after contact with the barriers, followed by a pit stop, amazingly Alonso came back into the race and powered on in a trademark display of his indefatigability, and finished in the points – before a 30-second penalty dropped him down to P15. PALMER: Alonso’s remarkable COTA recovery was the drive of the season – but was the penalty fair? It looked like it was going to be a painful weekend for Haas when in qualifying Mick Schumacher spun on his final Q1 lap and Magnussen struggled for pace, taking 16th on the grid. The Danish driver backed himself on Sunday though – Magnussen was the only driver to pull off a one-stopper – and found himself running up in the points. His medium tyres did eventutally drop off, which allowed Vettel to pass him, but Haas welcomed P8 after a slow Saturday. READ MORE: 'That was some driving' – Magnussen applauds Vettel's last gasp overtake as Haas finally get back in the points Albon out-paced team mate Nicholas Latifi in qualifying and very nearly made it to Q3. Grid penalties meant that the Thai driver still started in the top 10, where Albon sparred against much faster midfielders before falling to P12. Taking into account machinery, this was still a solid weekend for the Williams driver. READ MORE: Albon says Williams should be ‘proud’ of performance in Austin despite missing out on points Perez somewhat flew under the radar this weekend. Fourth in qualifying, he couldn't keep up with his team mate, nor the leading Ferraris, and the Mexican then had a five-place grid drop to contend with. He kept his head down, battling back into the top five, but his pace was just not enough to break into the podium places as he finished behind fellow penalty-hit driver Leclerc.

I Watched Two Episodes of 'Drive to Survive' and Then Covered Formula 1, https://www.texasmonthly.com/arts-entertainment/formula-one-us-grand-prix-report/, The traffic chaos is just one part of the hullabaloo accompanying a Grand Prix weekend. Popular Videos Previous Next moreThe Grand Prix has been hosted at COTA since 2012, but this was my first time attending anything associated with it. So when Ferrari Trento offered me, of all people, a ticket for Sunday, it seemed too good to pass up. Alex Bierens de Haan/GettyEverybody in the Paddock Club was covered in lanyards, and there was a seemingly endless tier system of very important Very Important Person passes. For the most part, my experience of the U.S. Grand Prix remained primarily aural., Formula 1 is famous as a sport where cars go super-duper fast, but most of the vehicles at the United States Grand Prix move at a crawl. Every pickup, limousine, van, and shuttle that buses attendees to and from the Circuit of the Americas endures truly horrific traffic to do so. Unless you’re among the richest and most famous tier of spectators, who arrive and depart by chartered helicopter, your eighteen-mile trip back to downtown Austin at the end of any one of the event’s three days of activities will take hours. The shuttle I rode back and forth from last weekend’s race was not immune to the standstill. We were a motley crew of journalists, alcohol executives, and other guests of the Italian spirits company Ferrari Trento (no relation to the automaker), which makes the “Official Sparkling Wine of Formula 1,” a.k.a. the celebratory bubbly that gets sprayed all over the winners. It took two hours to drive back from the Circuit of the Americas to the Hyatt on Barton Springs. The Swedish guy across the aisle from me managed to take a nap, and wake up refreshed from said nap, all before we got out of the parking lot. The traffic chaos is just one part of the hullabaloo accompanying a Grand Prix weekend. Like a multibillion-dollar traveling circus, Formula 1 moves around the globe just as P. T. Barnum and company once toured America. Between the cars, the tools, the tents, and all the other race ephemera, F1 ships an estimated fifty tons of cargo from one Grand Prix to the next. Even the VIP experiences at the Paddock and Champions clubs are standard, no matter the racetrack. You’ll see the same catering and host staff in Austin that you do in Miami—and Monaco. Trailing behind the official Formula 1 freight and faculty is a tangled web of brands seeking to capitalize on the crowds attending the races. Though this year’s U.S. Grand Prix was held almost twenty miles outside of downtown Austin, there were activations, parties, and concerts all over the city, each with varying levels of exclusivity and different celebrities to help set the mood. I saw Tom Sandoval, a bartender from the reality show Vanderpump Rules (a.k.a. one of “the Toms”) three separate times over the course of as many days. I watched him strut into the bathroom at the racetrack; I saw him get his photo taken next to bottles of Patrón at a pool party sponsored by the tequila company; and I watched him sing karaoke with a live band on the rooftop deck of a members-only club called Soho House. Popular Videos Previous Next more The Grand Prix has been hosted at COTA since 2012, but this was my first time attending anything associated with it. The only sport I’ve ever really followed is RuPaul’s Drag Race, but my interest in Formula 1 had recently been piqued by the same thing that once got me to care about the Texas Rangers: a crush on a guy who was a big fan. The sport has always been popular in Europe, but thanks to a Netflix docuseries called Drive to Survive, it is finally having a moment stateside. At least that’s what all the sports people in my life were telling me. So when Ferrari Trento offered me, of all people, a ticket for Sunday, it seemed too good to pass up. In preparation for my day at the races, I watched almost two full episodes of the docuseries and studied the Formula 1 Wikipedia page (I also googled “what to wear to F1?” multiple times). I arrived at COTA patting myself on the back for knowing that Max Verstappen, who drives for Red Bull, had already clinched this year’s world championship. I also knew that seven-time champ Lewis Hamilton hadn’t finished first in a single race this season. He drove for Mercedes, which had long been the team to beat because it had the best cars. But then F1 implemented a cap on team spending and changed car regulations, and now Red Bull was at the top. I had decided I would “root” for Sergio “Checo” Pérez, because he is from Mexico. I was practically an expert. On Sunday, we arrived an hour and a half early for the 2 p.m. race—enough time for me to get the lay of the land before hearing the engines roar (an experience I was assured would be thrilling, even for me). We were given lanyards with rectangular credentials that had the heft and feel of high-limit credit cards. These passes gave us access to two venues, the standard Paddock Club by the starting line, and the Paddock Club at Turn 19, where guests could dine on Chilean sea bass and côte de boeuf while toasting from one of the 20,000 bottles of Ferrari Trento sparkling wine that were enjoyed throughout F1 weekend. Even though we were in semirural Texas, it felt at times like we had been transported to Europe. The tent we were in had EU power outlets, and the main Paddock Club had all-you-can-eat Kaiserschmarrn, basically the Austrian version of a funnel cake, which is the height of luxury as far as I’m concerned. And in perhaps the truest continental touch, not only were there numerous outdoor smoking sections in plain sight, even close to the fanciest VIP areas, but the smokers gathered on actual red carpets under their big, industrial ashtrays. It was beautiful. Lewis Hamilton, Max Verstappen, and Charles Leclerc spraying Ferrari Trento after the race. Courtesy of Ferrari Trento Shaq visits Williams Racing. Alex Bierens de Haan/Getty Everybody in the Paddock Club was covered in lanyards, and there was a seemingly endless tier system of very important Very Important Person passes. My credential couldn’t get me very far, which meant I had no hope of mingling with Shaq down on the paddock’s ground level, near the garages. For a moment, I did spot him from a distance before the race started, and I could hear him deejaying afterward. Scattered throughout the other thousand or so acres at COTA were tents from ever more brands, from Alfa Romeo to Lenovo. One tent—on top of a hill overlooking Turn 1—gave fans a clear view of the crash that happened ten seconds into the race, when front-runner Carlos Sainz was knocked off the track by George Russell (nobody was hurt). I didn’t see that crash. My seat at the Paddock only gave me a view of the starting line. But I knew it happened because I heard 100,000 fans switch from shouting “yeah” to “ewww” in a millisecond.  I’ll tell ya what, in that moment I learned a lot more about the appeal of F1 than I did from those episodes of Drive to Survive. I know it’s a sport that people watch, but man, what a thing to hear. Every time the sound of those engines hit my ears—with the race cars flying by at more than two hundred miles per hour—it sent through my body an immediate and involuntary need to party. One more serving of Kaiserschmarrn, dear sir! For the most part, my experience of the U.S. Grand Prix remained primarily aural. There was another, more serious collision that I didn’t see, and fortunately, both drivers once again emerged more or less unscathed. I missed that one while riding a golf cart to Club Cash App, where my invitation promised a chance to mingle with celebrities as disparate as Serena Williams and Brooklyn Beckham, David and Victoria’s oldest son. I was on the golf cart because it was a two-mile walk from the Paddock Club to Club Cash App’s tent—a distance I was able to confirm later, when I couldn’t get any of the ten or so golf carts outside Club Cash App to bring me back. (They had all been reserved for the celebrities as varied as Serena Williams and Brooklyn Beckham, it turned out.) Having stretched my VIP lanyard as far as it would go, I wandered back toward the Paddock Club through general admission, where thousands of happy attendees sat on bleachers or grassy hilltops overlooking the race. A Ferris wheel, a convoy of food trucks, and a slew of regular funnel cake vendors helped turn EuroTexas back into Texas, Texas, and made the Grand Prix feel more like a rodeo or county fair. By the time I made it through GA, I’d all but decided that Formula 1 should add a livestock show to its Austin festivities. As I drew closer to some signs identifying Turn 19, I found myself thinking that the walk hadn’t been bad at all, and that’s when I figured out that I was at the same turn but on the wrong side of the track. The Circuit of the Americas was built with no regard for pedestrian crosswalks or underpasses, so I had to trek another mile and a half (past the front gate, through one tunnel, and behind the Shaq-only zone) to get back to the Paddock Club. I didn’t see the race end, but I heard it when the crowd roared for Max Verstappen, who picked up his thirteenth win of the season. Minutes later, I passed a crowd barreling onto the track for the customary post-race “track invasion.” Had I not been running late for the shuttle, I might have run with them. I don’t care about sports, but I love sports fans. Feeling like I might have wasted my one opportunity to have an exclusive F1 experience (unless Club Cash App invites me back, I will never be able to afford a VIP package), I arrived sheepishly back at the Paddock Club in time to eat some chilled chocolate fondant with sea-salt caramel and some homemade mint parfait before the caterers closed up shop. Together with the other last-callers, I walked one more mile back to the parking lot. Along the way, we passed a merchandise tent engaged in price-gouging that’d make even Beyoncé blush: $80 for branded F1 baseball caps and $130 for team jerseys. It took a comically long time to find our shuttle in the parking lot full of identical shuttles. We were supposed to meet at zone A7, but it turned out there was more than one A7, or we were supposed to be at A6, or something. I still don’t understand what happened, but we eventually boarded the correct shuttle, joining the rest of the Ferrari Trento guests, who were handing out snacks and popping more bottles of official F1 bubbly. The Swedish gentleman across the aisle told me his barbecue-flavored potato chips were better than he expected, before he settled down for his nap. When our chariot finally dropped us off at the Hyatt, we’d spent as much time traveling eighteen miles as Max Verstappen, Lewis Hamilton, and Sergio “Checo” Pérez spent driving 3,426 miles in 56 laps around the Circuit of the Americas.
Mercedes plans to race controversial new F1 front wing in Mexico, https://the-race.com/formula-1/mercedes-plans-to-race-controversial-new-f1-front-wing-in-mexico/, Mercedes is planning to race with a new front wing on its 2022 Formula 1 car at the Mexico Grand Prix – a wing which raised eyebrows when first revealed in Austin last weekend. The team publicly displayed a new wing for the W13 at the United States GP as part of a wider upgrade package but didn’t run the wing detail all weekend. But Mercedes Formula 1 technical director Mike Elliott said it was always the plan to not run the wing as the team didn’t have enough copies of it for both drivers to run the update. Mercedes says the fasteners on the wing are there to keep it together while the counterargument is that their distribution is deliberate for aerodynamic gain. Gary Anderson: Mercedes’ wing upgrade exploits a grey area Read more“That is our last major update but there are always a string of new parts, smaller parts, that we are looking at,” Shovlin added., Mercedes is planning to race with a new front wing on its 2022 Formula 1 car at the Mexico Grand Prix – a wing which raised eyebrows when first revealed in Austin last weekend. The team publicly displayed a new wing for the W13 at the United States GP as part of a wider upgrade package but didn’t run the wing detail all weekend. This followed question marks being raised over the legality of the specially shaped fasteners between the two upper flaps that led to an “exchange” with the FIA. But Mercedes Formula 1 technical director Mike Elliott said it was always the plan to not run the wing as the team didn’t have enough copies of it for both drivers to run the update. Mercedes: Arguing new wing detail probably not worth the risk Read more Elliott said he was unsure whether Mercedes would run the new front wing detail during the three remaining races in 2022 because of the risk of it being found illegal when it only provides a marginal performance improvement. “Personally, I think we could argue them,” Elliott said in Austin. “But the question becomes whether we want to or not. “The gain for those bits is so small, is it worth the risk of falling foul of the stewards?” The legality question marks centre around what the primary purpose of the design is. Mercedes says the fasteners on the wing are there to keep it together while the counterargument is that their distribution is deliberate for aerodynamic gain. “The reason we didn’t run it in Austin was that we only had one of those parts,” trackside engineering director Andrew Shovlin said in the team’s regular race debrief YouTube video. Mercedes front wing may need tweaking after FIA ‘exchange’ Read more “So, if we damaged it during qualifying it would have meant the car that damaged the wing had to start from the back. “Also with a very busy programme, we had the tyre test in FP2, we didn’t actually have time to evaluate. “We have more of those parts available in Mexico, we will run that on the Friday, we’ll check it’s all working as expected, and the plan at this stage is to race that wing.” Shovlin confirmed that while Austin’s upgrade marked the final major development of the season, the team will still make changes to the W13 during the final three races. Gary Anderson: Mercedes’ wing upgrade exploits a grey area Read more “That is our last major update but there are always a string of new parts, smaller parts, that we are looking at,” Shovlin added. “Either to get a small gain in performance, [or] at a lot of it as this stage of the year though is learning for next year, so some of those test parts are really just trying to understand some of the development direction we want to go in. “So like I said, it’s the last major update, but it won’t be the last change to the car.” As well as attempting to gather data for when it – according to team boss Toto Wolff – changes the “DNA” of its car next year, Mercedes is also trying to save itself from its first win-less F1 season since 2011.
This Is How America Could Get Its Next Formula 1 Driver, https://jalopnik.com/this-is-how-america-could-get-its-next-formula-1-driver-1849691412, This year, Formula 1 has been close to securing an American driver for the first time since 2015, but countless issues have risen to the fore to keep that from happening. He just needs a few more super license points. Plenty of folks have become very familiar with F1's super license system this year thanks to rumors about IndyCar driver Colton Herta becoming a top pick for the AlphaTauri team’s second seat. Essentially, a super license is a way for drivers to be recognized as capable of competing at the F1 level. Sargeant, on the other hand, is extremely close to securing the necessary 40 points required for a super license., This year, Formula 1 has been close to securing an American driver for the first time since 2015, but countless issues have risen to the fore to keep that from happening. But over the United States Grand Prix weekend, Williams team principal Jost Capito confirmed that the team is fully prepared to sign Logan Sargeant alongside Alex Albon for 2023. He just needs a few more super license points. Plenty of folks have become very familiar with F1's super license system this year thanks to rumors about IndyCar driver Colton Herta becoming a top pick for the AlphaTauri team’s second seat. Essentially, a super license is a way for drivers to be recognized as capable of competing at the F1 level. You can read more about the requirements here, but to put it quite simply, Herta was nowhere near having enough points, largely due to the way IndyCar is weighted. Sargeant, on the other hand, is extremely close to securing the necessary 40 points required for a super license. As it currently stands, Sargeant is third in the Formula 2 standings. If he remains there, he’ll secure a super license. He’ll secure a super license even if he finishes fifth in the standings. If he finishes sixth in F2, he’ll be two points short of a super license, but he can nab both of them by completing the race season without any penalty points. Advertisement “Yeah, we feel he’s ready to race. Under the condition that he has enough super license points after Abu Dhabi, he will be our second driver next year,” Capito said during the team principal press conference at the United States Grand Prix. He continued, as per Formula 1: “He’s had one season in F2, and I’m a fan of getting young drivers as quick through as possible into Formula 1 because the series below, the cars compare to Formula 1 cars… so get him in as quick as possible and find out if he’s capable of staying in Formula 1 for a long time, which we believe he is. “And his first year in F2, and he won races, and he has been qualifying very strong all these years in his career — and we believe he’s absolutely ready to get into Formula 1.” G/O Media may get a commission 10% off 10% off Wish A gift for literally everybody.

Audi confirm deal with Sauber to join Formula One from 2026 season, https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/oct/26/audi-confirm-sauber-deal-to-join-formula-one-grid-from-2026-season, Audi has confirmed it will enter Formula One by taking a stake in the Sauber team that will become the car manufacturer’s works entry in 2026. Audi, which is part of the Volkswagen group, announced its intent to enter F1 at the Belgian GP in August. The Sauber team principal, Fred Vasseur, was optimistic Audi resources would make a real difference for them. “Audi is the best strategic partner for the Sauber Group,” he said. Earlier this year, Porsche, also part of the Volkswagen group, were expected to enter F1, but their proposed partnership with Red Bull fell through in September., Audi has confirmed it will enter Formula One by taking a stake in the Sauber team that will become the car manufacturer’s works entry in 2026. Sauber currently races under the Alfa Romeo brand using Ferrari engines. It will continue to use their power units when it is expected to revert to the Sauber name for 2024 and 2025 before becoming the Audi factory team and using Audi engines on its entry into the sport. Audi, which is part of the Volkswagen group, announced its intent to enter F1 at the Belgian GP in August. Its partnership with Sauber was long expected and was confirmed on Wednesday. The manufacturer, which was founded in 1909, has not competed in F1 and the decision to enter the sport was grounded in the new engine regulations due to begin in 2026. Sauber has been competing in F1 since 1993 when it used Mercedes engines. The team’s best finish in the world championship was second in 2007 (the year McLaren were disqualified) and third in 2008. The Sauber team principal, Fred Vasseur, was optimistic Audi resources would make a real difference for them. “The partnership between Audi AG and Sauber Motorsport is a key step for our team as we continue to make progress towards the front of the grid,” he said. “To become Audi’s official works team is not only an honour and a great responsibility: it’s the best option for the future, and we are fully confident we can help Audi achieve the objectives they have set for their journey in F1.” Oliver Hoffmann, the Audi F1 head of F1 technical development, also expected a strong partnership. “We are delighted to have gained such an experienced and competent partner for our ambitious Formula 1 project,” he said. “We already know the Sauber Group with its state-of-the-art facility and experienced team from previous collaborations and are convinced that together we will form a strong team.” It was welcomed by Finn Rausing, the chairman of Sauber’s board of directors. “Audi is the best strategic partner for the Sauber Group,” he said. “It is clear that we share values and a vision, and we look forward to achieving our common goals in a strong and successful partnership.” It is known that the increased role of electrical elements in the 2026 power units and the intent to run the engines on fully sustainable fuels were a major part in Audi’s decision-making process. The engines will be manufactured at its Neuburg base in Bavaria. Audi had previously placed a central focus of its racing activities in sports cars, enjoying enormous success at the Le Mans 24 Hours, where it has taken victory 13 times. (Farther back, the company participated in grand prix racing in the 1930s as part of Auto Union AG, a partnership of four German auto companies whose racing rivals included Mercedes.)

Audi To Supply Engines For Sauber In Formula One, https://sports.ndtv.com/formula-1/audi-to-supply-engines-for-sauber-in-formula-one-3463538, German manufacturer Audi will make its entry into Formula One by supplying the engines for Sauber from 2026, they said on Wednesday. Sauber presently race as Alfa Romeo with a Ferrari engine but they are cutting ties with Alfa Romeo at the end of 2023. Switzerland-based Sauber -- who have just one race win, at the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix -- in 30 seasons in Formula One were delighted to be the first team in Formula One to be supplied by Audi. "The great interest in Formula 1 is global and the racing series is one of the sporting events with the highest reach in the world," Audi said. Audi did race pre-World War II in the European Championship that was the root of Formula One., German manufacturer Audi will make its entry into Formula One by supplying the engines for Sauber from 2026, they said on Wednesday. Sauber presently race as Alfa Romeo with a Ferrari engine but they are cutting ties with Alfa Romeo at the end of 2023. They will continue to use the Ferrari engine until the 2026 campaign. "We already know the Sauber Group with its state-of-the-art facility and experienced team from previous collaborations and are convinced that together we will form a strong team," said Oliver Hoffmann, Audi AG board member responsible for the F1 programme. Switzerland-based Sauber -- who have just one race win, at the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix -- in 30 seasons in Formula One were delighted to be the first team in Formula One to be supplied by Audi. "To become Audi's official works team is not only an honour and a great responsibility," said Sauber Motorsport CEO and Team Principal Fred Vasseur. "It's the best option for the future and we are fully confident we can help Audi achieve the objectives they have set for their journey in Formula 1." The engine will be developed at Audi Sport's facility near Ingolstadt. The company heralded the fact back in August when they announced their entry into Formula One, saying it would be "the first time in more than a decade that a Formula 1 power train will be built in Germany". Audi took the decision shortly after it was agreed at FIA's World Motor Sport Council that new engines, or power units (PU), would be required in Formula 1 by 2026, aimed at greater sustainability. The new motors will increase electrical power by up to 50 percent and use 100 percent sustainable fuel. Audi also sees enormous potential by being associated with Formula One for selling more cars globally. "The great interest in Formula 1 is global and the racing series is one of the sporting events with the highest reach in the world," Audi said. "In 2021, more than 1.5 billion TV viewers watched the races. "Formula 1 is popular in key markets such as China and the USA and the trend continues to rise, even among young target groups." Audi did race pre-World War II in the European Championship that was the root of Formula One. Audi and three other German car manufacturers formed the Auto Union company. Promoted They enjoyed their most successful campaign in 1936 when Bernd Rosemeyer won three of the four races, winning the title, with team-mate Hans Stuck second.

Formula 1: 5 drivers with more wins than Max Verstappen, https://beyondtheflag.com/2022/10/26/formula-1-5-drivers-wins-max-verstappen/, Max Verstappen now sits in sixth place on the all-time Formula 1 wins list following the United States Grand Prix. Red Bull’s Max Verstappen tied two-time Formula 1 world champion Fernando Alonso for sixth place on the all-time wins list with his Japanese Grand Prix victory at Suzuka Circuit, a win which made him a two-time world champion himself. But perhaps more important historically, there are now just five drivers ahead of the 25-year-old Dutchman on the all-time wins list. Lewis HamiltonLewis Hamilton overtook Schumacher on the all-time wins list in 2020, and he now owns 103 victories in 307 career starts. How high can Max Verstappen, who is currently under contract with Red Bull through the 2028 season, climb on the all-time wins list?, Max Verstappen now sits in sixth place on the all-time Formula 1 wins list following the United States Grand Prix. Who is ahead of him? Red Bull’s Max Verstappen tied two-time Formula 1 world champion Fernando Alonso for sixth place on the all-time wins list with his Japanese Grand Prix victory at Suzuka Circuit, a win which made him a two-time world champion himself. With his United States Grand Prix victory at Circuit of the Americas this past Sunday afternoon, Verstappen now has now officially passed Alonso for sixth place on the all-time wins list with 33 in 160 career starts. The win was his 13th of the 2022 season, tying the all-time single-season record set by seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher in 2004 and later tied by four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel in 2013. There are still three races remaining on this year’s 22-race schedule for him to potentially break it. But perhaps more important historically, there are now just five drivers ahead of the 25-year-old Dutchman on the all-time wins list. At the start of the year, he was tied for 16th place on that list. Who are those five drivers? 5. Ayrton Senna Ayrton Senna won 41 races in 161 career starts. The three-time world champion was tragically killed in a crash at Imola in 1994, at which point he was the sport’s second winningest driver of all-time. 4. Alain Prost Alain Prost won 51 races in 199 career starts. The four-time world champion, one of three drivers on this list to have held the all-time Formula 1 wins record at some point, made his final start in 1993. He initially stopped competing after the 1991 season and took a year off, but he returned for one final year. 3. Sebastian Vettel Sebastian Vettel has 53 wins to his name in 296 career starts. The four-time world champion is set to retire at the end of the 2022 season. 2. Michael Schumacher Michael Schumacher owned the wins record for nearly two decades, and by a sizable margin over Prost in second place. With 91 wins in 306 career starts, the seven-time champion, who retired for a second time after the 2012 season, once owned the record by a 40-win margin, a total which would have been just one shy of second highest as its own win total at the time. 1. Lewis Hamilton Lewis Hamilton overtook Schumacher on the all-time wins list in 2020, and he now owns 103 victories in 307 career starts. The sport’s other seven-time world champion hasn’t yet won a race in 2022, so he remains tied with Schumacher on the all-time list of consecutive winning seasons with 15. How high can Max Verstappen, who is currently under contract with Red Bull through the 2028 season, climb on the all-time wins list? Having won double-digit races in each of the last two seasons, it may not be too far-fetched to suggest he could climb into the top five next year and into the top three within the next few years. This year alone, he has passed Mika Hakkinen (20), Kimi Raikkonen (21), Damon Hill (22), Nico Rosberg (23), Nelson Piquet (23), Juan Manuel Fangio (24), Niki Lauda (25), Jim Clark (25), Jackie Stewart (27), Nigel Mansell (31), and Alonso (32).

Audi Set To Enter Formula 1 As A Full Works Team From 2026, https://www.carandbike.com/news/audi-set-to-enter-formula-1-as-a-full-works-team-from-2026-3203221, Formula 1 is set to get its new set of regulations from 2026. Audi had earlier announced plans to enter Formula 1 from 2026 as an engine supplier. There were also talks of Audi buying a stake in the Sauber F1 Team (which is currently rebranded as Alfa Romeo F1 team), and the team would then subsequently be renamed to Audi F1 Team. “The partnership between Audi AG and Sauber Motorsport is a key step for our team as we continue to make progress towards the front of the grid. Stefano Domenicali, President and CEO of F1 said, “It is great news to hear that Audi will have a partnership with Sauber for their entry into Formula 1 in 2026.", Formula 1 is set to get its new set of regulations from 2026. The biggest change these new regulations will bring will be in the engine department, as Formula 1 will move to 100% sustainable fuels, and will also see increased electrical power with a beefier MGU-K (Motor Generation Unit - Kinetic, the part responsible to generate energy when a car is braking), and an absence of an MGU-H (Motor Generation Unit - Heat). Taking advantage of this regulation change - which will level the playing field - Audi had already announced plans to join Formula 1 from 2026 as an engine supplier, and the German company - which is under the Volkswagen group - already has more than 120 people working on the project at its base in Neuburg in Germany. Audi had earlier announced plans to enter Formula 1 from 2026 as an engine supplier. There were also talks of Audi buying a stake in the Sauber F1 Team (which is currently rebranded as Alfa Romeo F1 team), and the team would then subsequently be renamed to Audi F1 Team.

Sauber’s title partnership with Alfa Romeo is set to come to an end at the end of 2023, and the team will continue to use Ferrari engines until the end of 2025. “We already know the Sauber Group with its state-of-the-art facility and experienced team from previous collaborations and are convinced that together we will form a strong team.” said Oliver Hoffmann, Audi AG Board Member responsible for the F1 programme. “The partnership between Audi AG and Sauber Motorsport is a key step for our team as we continue to make progress towards the front of the grid. To become Audi’s official works team is not only an honour and a great responsibility: it’s the best option for the future and we are fully confident we can help Audi achieve the objectives they have set for their journey in Formula 1,” Sauber Motorsport CEO and F1 Team Principal Fred Vasseur added Audi has plans to buy a stake in the Sauber Group too. Stefano Domenicali, President and CEO of F1 said, “It is great news to hear that Audi will have a partnership with Sauber for their entry into Formula 1 in 2026." "We look forward to seeing their progress over the coming years and the car on the grid for the team’s first race.” Post 2026, Sauber will continue to develop & manufacture the racecar, while Audi will build the engines powering it. Post 2026, Sauber will continue to develop and manufacture the team’s race car at its headquarters in Hinwil, Switzerland, and will also run the race operations under Audi’s banner, while Audi will be responsible of developing the engines. Audi also said that the expansion of its Neuburg facility in terms of personnel, buildings and technical infrastructure should “be largely in place in 2023”, and the carmaker plans to run the first tests of the 2026 power unit in a Formula 1 test car in 2025.

By partnering with Sauber, Audi will instantly get access to a well-oiled F1 team without the pain of building that from scratchWhy does it make sense for Sauber?, The next piece in Audi’s Formula 1 puzzle has been revealed with news the German manufacturer will make Sauber their factory squad from 2026. F1 Correspondent Lawrence Barretto looks at why the two big motorsport names are joining forces… When Audi announced in August that they would join F1 in 2026 as an engine supplier, having been enticed by sweeping new rules to be introduced for that year that include a greater focus on electrical power and use of 100% sustainable fuels, Sauber immediately emerged as their most likely partner. Once Audi signed up to the new rules, talks could accelerate about how a partnership with Sauber would work. And now, ahead of the Mexican Grand Prix, a deal for Sauber to become Audi’s work team has been done. Audi will acquire a stake in Sauber, too, but the details are still being ironed out. READ MORE: Sauber to become Audi works F1 team from 2026 Why did Audi go for Sauber? Audi spoke to several Formula 1 teams – including McLaren, Williams and Sauber – about a partnership, as they evaluated their entry into F1. Sauber quickly became favourites. The team have a rich motorsport history, which saw Peter Sauber bring the banner into F1 in 1993, and one of the best facilities in Formula 1. Supported by owner Finn Rausing, boss Fred Vasseur has been given the funds to bring the factory up to date so that they have the software and hardware to compete. Peter Sauber brought his eponymous team into F1 back in 1993 They have a state-of-the-art wind tunnel, which Audi know well, having rented it for various projects in the past including for their World Endurance Championship programme, and a high quality simulator to boot. It’s effectively a turn-key operation where Audi can come in with their power unit and crack straight on, minimising the risk of setting up an entire team from scratch. Vasseur has a great track record – he was highly successful in the junior formulae before stepping up to F1 – and Sauber have shown they can work with manufacturers, having had a short stint as BMW’s factory team in the 2000s, and operationally they are among the best in the business. READ MORE: ‘It’s perfect timing due to the new rules’ – Audi boss explains why they joined F1 Audi will shrewdly leave Sauber to do what they do best – run the race team trackside and at base, and develop the chassis. Having agreed the deal so early, it allows for good time for the two companies to learn how to work together and develop working practices so that the development of the chassis and power unit is seamless. So far, they are making all the right moves. By partnering with Sauber, Audi will instantly get access to a well-oiled F1 team without the pain of building that from scratch Why does it make sense for Sauber? Sauber are one of the most resilient teams Formula 1 has ever seen, the Swiss team’s very survival having been under threat multiple times – particularly in the last decade – but they’ve always found a way to continue. Having an incredible owner in Peter Sauber, who has been dedicated to his staff from the moment he began the Sauber Motorsport brand in 1970, a new owner in Finn Rausing who loves racing and is a shrewd businessman, and securing fruitful partnerships with Ferrari for power units and Alfa Romeo for commercial backing has helped not just steady the ship but provide a platform on which to move forward rather than focus on staying afloat. READ MORE: Audi’s 2026 F1 entry a ‘testament to where the sport is’ says Horner Doing a deal with Audi makes sense for lots of reasons. The cash injection means they can push up to the budget cap and be on a financial level playing field with the other nine teams on the grid for the first time since their stint with BMW. REACTION: Audi to join Formula 1 in 2026 And they have a power unit supplier who will be fully focused on them – and getting the best out of the chassis-power unit integration. Working with a prestigious brand will make them more attractive commercially, which in turn will secure the team’s long-term future while also aiding their on-track performance. This year, for example, upgrades had to go on hold because of additional unexpected costs like higher freight prices. They will be more protected from such scenarios going forward. READ MORE: All the reaction as F1 prepares to welcome Audi As a works operation, providing they deliver on track performance, it’s likely they will also become an attractive landing spot for F1’s top talent. And, perhaps most importantly, Audi know Sauber have the experience to get the job done – so they will allow Vasseur to run the team his way while still maintaining a very close relationship.

The goal now will be to return to at least the upper midfield. Sauber, who first debuted in Formula 1 in 1993, partnered with Alfa Romeo in 2018 but have still been operating at a smaller budget than nearly all of their rivals, and have been towards the back of the grid since.

The new generation of F1 engines will feature increased electrical power and 100 per cent sustainable fuels.

Sauber noted: “This partnership will bring the team to new heights, guaranteeing at the same time the long-term future of the company – an entity that boasts a committed workforce, one of Europe’s leading wind tunnels and world-class motorsport manufacturing facilities.” As previously announced, the team will continue to compete under the Alfa Romeo name in 2023. It is expected to revert to its Sauber identity for 2024 and 2025, assuming that the current Alfa sponsorship deal ends. The team will continue to use Ferrari power units for those interim seasons. In a rare public statement, main shareholder and chairman of the board of Sauber Holdings Finn Rausing indicated that he will remain involved.

Sebastian Vettel is feeling no regret on Formula 1 retirement call, https://www.planetf1.com/news/sebastian-vettel-no-regret-f1-retirement/, Despite a recent upturn in form for he and Aston Martin, Sebastian Vettel is not planning on reversing his decision to retire. Sadly a slow pit stop would prove a major setback for Vettel, taking away the opportunity of a very strong points haul. Vettel confirmed though that this is not the case. Of course,” said Vettel following the US GP, after briefly hesitating, when asked if he is regretting his retirement call. But it seems what was needed was an improving Aston Martin and a Vettel driving without pressure, only pleasure, to reignite that spark., Despite a recent upturn in form for he and Aston Martin, Sebastian Vettel is not planning on reversing his decision to retire. It was ahead of the Hungarian Grand Prix that Vettel confirmed 2022 as his final season in Formula 1, at that stage having scored points only once in his last four outings as Aston Martin struggled to turn their heavy investment into clear progress. Vettel though has really been finding form in recent rounds, currently on a streak of three points-scoring finishes in a row, P8 in Singapore, P6 in Japan and P7 in the United States GP. The highlight of those was without doubt the US GP, Vettel at one stage leading as Aston Martin looked the best they had all season at the Circuit of The Americas. Sadly a slow pit stop would prove a major setback for Vettel, taking away the opportunity of a very strong points haul. Nonetheless, he fought back valiantly into the points, clinching P7 with a last-lap pass on Kevin Magnussen which Jenson Button described as one of the best overtakes he has seen. As the season, and Vettel’s Formula 1 career, moves towards a respective conclusion, Vettel is now looking much more like the four-time World Champion again, so he was asked by Bild if the decision to retire is one which he is regretting, Fernando Alonso already confirmed by Aston Martin as his replacement. Vettel confirmed though that this is not the case. “No. Of course,” said Vettel following the US GP, after briefly hesitating, when asked if he is regretting his retirement call. “I will miss such moments, that’s no secret. “But I thought about the decision for a long time and also about such moments and the adrenaline that I will miss. “Part of me will miss it, but another part of me is looking forward to what’s coming.” The real Sebastian Vettel has returned, to be gone so soon Vettel refinding his form has something of a bittersweet feel to it. Not since 2019 have we seen Vettel anywhere near the kind of form which took him to four consecutive Drivers’ titles, his last season at Ferrari a painful watch, while the switch to Aston Martin had failed to bring the real Vettel back. But it seems what was needed was an improving Aston Martin and a Vettel driving without pressure, only pleasure, to reignite that spark. Austin was much more like the Vettel we all remembered, putting his experience and racecraft to full use as he sniffed for an opportunity behind the leaders. Even at the round before in Japan, it was great to see and hear the pure enjoyment for Vettel as he raced around the iconic Suzuka track one more time in Formula 1. So for that reason, we are happy, yet also sad as this version of Vettel, which we have waited years to see again, will call it quits in less than a month from now. Let’s just enjoy it while we can then, since Vettel clearly is not having second thoughts. Read more: Jacques Villeneuve calls for Lance Stroll race ban after ‘unacceptable’ crash

Audi’s Formula 1 entry was confirmed at the end of August following the World Motor Sport Council’s approval of the power unit regulations set to come into effect for the 2026 season and the German manufacturer will now enter into a partnership with Sauber that will see it take a stake in the Swiss racing team, which has been in F1 since 1993.

Audi partners with Sauber for Formula 1 entry, https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motorsport-f1/audi-partners-sauber-formula-1-entry, Audi will partner with Sauber for its Formula 1 entry in 2026, it has confirmed. The German car maker plans to purchase a stake in the Swiss motorsport-engineering company and operate its grand prix team as a factory entry. Sauber will oversee chassis development and production in Hinwil, while Audi will build the powertrain at its motorsport headquarters in Neuberg. “We are delighted to have gained such an experienced and competent partner for our ambitious Formula 1 project,” said Audi technical boss Oliver Hoffmann. That makes entry into the sport a vastly more attractive prospect for the Volkswagen Group brands., Audi will partner with Sauber for its Formula 1 entry in 2026, it has confirmed.

"We already know the Sauber Group with its state-of-the-art facility and experienced team from previous collaborations and are convinced that together we will form a strong team.” Audi previously used Sauber’s facilities to develop race cars for the World Endurance Championship and Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters. Sauber will continue with current title sponsor Alfa Romeo through the 2023 season but is expected to revert to its own identity for 2024 and 2025. Audi’s F1 entry came in the wake of the FIA's approval of new F1 engine regulations for the 2026 season, which were broadly seen as a green light for Audi and sibling brand Porsche to enter the sport. Audi CEO Markus Deusmann previously said: “Motorsport is an integral part of Audi’s DNA. Formula 1 is both a global stage for our brand and a highly challenging development laboratory. The combination of high performance and competition is always a driver of innovation and technology transfer in our industry. "With the new rules, now is the right time for us to get involved. After all, Formula 1 and Audi both pursue clear sustainability goals.” “Formula 1 is the next major milestone in Audi’s motorsport history,” said Julius Seebach, who will soon leave his role as boss of Audi Sport to "take on a new strategic business area in technical development, reporting directly to the executive board". Both Audi and Porsche were awaiting confirmation that the 'motor generator unit - heat' (MGU-H), which captures energy from exhaust gases, would be scrapped from 2026 as part of the rule revamp, given the significant cost of developing such a complex system that has no relevance in a road car development context. From 2026, electrical energy for the hybrid drivetrain element will be generated exclusively by the more conventional kinetic recovery system, which works via energy recuperation under braking – much like on a road-going EV. That makes entry into the sport a vastly more attractive prospect for the Volkswagen Group brands.

The newly-crowned constructors' champions had been in discussions with the FIA in the lead-up to the United States GP after being accused of a 'minor' breach of 2021's $145m spending limit, although talks were put on hold following the death of Red Bull owner Dietrich Mateschitz on Saturday. Red Bull said the deadline for an 'accepted breach agreement' [ABA] with the FIA had therefore been extended, and that they expect talks to pick back up before the Mexico City GP.

He was also critical of the sport's governing body for not giving more feedback during the process on their submissions. He has promised "complete transparency" once the process has concluded and says there will not be a repeat of a "secret deal" - like when Ferrari and the FIA reached a "settlement" amid engine legality suspicions in 2019.

F1 Helps Break Passenger Records for Austin-Bergstrom Airport, https://jalopnik.com/f1-helps-break-passenger-records-for-austin-bergstrom-a-1849700876, Austin-Bergstrom International Airport had an eventful year before October. Austin-Bergstrom International Airport opened in 1999, and the profile of Austin as a city has dramatically changed since then. AdvertisementOn Monday, 43,177 passengers departed on flights from Austin-Bergstrom, a new record for the airport. When Austin-Bergstrom opened in 1999, the airport was designed to handle 11 million passengers annually, or 30,137 passengers per day. A major expansion for Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, called AUS 2040 Master Plan, will add a 20-gate concourse expansion, effectively doubling the airport’s current passenger capacity up to over 31 million passengers annually., Austin-Bergstrom International Airport had an eventful year before October. Serving the Texas capital has been a challenge dealing with the same flight delays, cancellations and staff shortages impacting nearly every other airport across the country . On top of that, Austin-Bergstrom nearly ran out of jet fuel in the spring. The airport even suffered a three-hour power outage last month. However, Austin-Bergstrom is also seeing its passenger numbers rocket past pre-pandemic levels and now breaking records, mainly due to Formula 1’s United States Grand Prix this past weekend. Austin-Bergstrom International Airport opened in 1999, and the profile of Austin as a city has dramatically changed since then. Most importantly for potential tourists from overseas, the FIA Formula One World Championship began racing annually in Austin in 2012. A decade and a hit Netflix docuseries later, this year’s United States Grand Prix attracted over 440,000 fans to the Circuit of the Americas over the race weekend. That number of people converging on a metropolitan area of 2.3 million drastically impacted its transportation infrastructure. Advertisement On Monday, 43,177 passengers departed on flights from Austin-Bergstrom, a new record for the airport. KXAN reported that the new record broke the previous record (set only last week) by over 7,800 passengers. That record was set the day after the second weekend of the Austin City Limits music festival. When Austin-Bergstrom opened in 1999, the airport was designed to handle 11 million passengers annually, or 30,137 passengers per day. That’s quite the influx. A major expansion for Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, called AUS 2040 Master Plan, will add a 20-gate concourse expansion, effectively doubling the airport’s current passenger capacity up to over 31 million passengers annually. With the Circuit of the Americas signing a five-year deal to remain on the Formula 1 calendar, I don’t expect the air travel demand to Austin to diminish anytime soon, so AUS will need all the help it can get.

TECH TUESDAY: Why Mercedes' experimental front wing caused a stir in Texas, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.tech-tuesday-why-mercedes-experimental-front-wing-caused-a-stir-in-texas.45eoGEmPPgkGZnopgzTnEq.html, Mercedes brought a new front wing to the Circuit of The Americas which caused a certain amount of discussion about whether or not it complied to the regulations. The original intention was to debut the wing this coming weekend in Mexico and it was brought to Austin just as a free practice test item in order to complete its correlation process. But its distinctive appearance – with a series of five enlarged slot gap separators – seems to have alerted at least one rival team, who then queried the wing with the FIA.

However, even if it gives consent for the component to be used, the FIA Technical Department is not the official judge of compliance., Mercedes brought a new front wing to the Circuit of The Americas which caused a certain amount of discussion about whether or not it complied to the regulations. The original intention was to debut the wing this coming weekend in Mexico and it was brought to Austin just as a free practice test item in order to complete its correlation process. But its distinctive appearance – with a series of five enlarged slot gap separators – seems to have alerted at least one rival team, who then queried the wing with the FIA. READ MORE: Hamilton ‘super grateful’ to Mercedes for delivering upgrades to US Grand Prix Before the wing was created, it went through the normal process of being submitted to the FIA Technical Department in CAD (computer-aided design) drawing form. At this point the FIA will then either a) approve the component’s use or b) say why it believes it does not conform to the technical regulations. However, even if it gives consent for the component to be used, the FIA Technical Department is not the official judge of compliance. Such decisions fall to the race stewards and so just because a component has been passed does not make it immune from other teams questioning the FIA about its legality – and that is what is happening here.

Fernando Alonso: Alpine driver questions Formula 1 direction after US GP penalty, https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/63381586, Alpine driver Fernando Alonso, right, fought back from a 180mph crash to finish seventh at the United States GP in Austin, TexasFernando Alonso says a penalty he received in the United States Grand Prix raises questions about the direction of the sport under governing body the FIA. A protest by Alonso's Alpine team against the decision to demote him out of the points after he finished seventh in a damaged car will be heard on Thursday. Alonso wrote on Instagram: "It is an important day for the sport as this decision will dictate if we are going in the right direction." The team have questioned the US GP stewards' decision to allow a protest by the Haas team despite it being posted after the permitted time limit had expired. Perez drove some laps with a damaged front wing, part of which then fell off the car while he was running., Alpine driver Fernando Alonso, right, fought back from a 180mph crash to finish seventh at the United States GP in Austin, Texas Fernando Alonso says a penalty he received in the United States Grand Prix raises questions about the direction of the sport under governing body the FIA. A protest by Alonso's Alpine team against the decision to demote him out of the points after he finished seventh in a damaged car will be heard on Thursday. Alonso wrote on Instagram: "It is an important day for the sport as this decision will dictate if we are going in the right direction." Alonso said his post was in response to messages of support since the penalty. He thanked those who had contacted him on social media, adding: "It's one of those rare times in sport that I feel we are all on the same page and share the same opinion towards rules and regulations." Alonso said after the race that he considered his drive one of the best of his career, after he crashed at 180mph, his car did a wheelie, hit a wall, he pitted for a new front wing, resumed at the back and climbed to seventh despite damaged aerodynamic parts. The two-time champion has questioned the decision-making of officials on a number of occasions this year, and his frustrations about the inconsistency of policing of action on track are shared by the majority of his fellow drivers. At the Spanish Grand Prix, he accused the FIA of "incompetence" and lacking knowledge of racing. Criticism of the FIA's running of F1 has been a theme this year, and the US Grand Prix was the race after the governing body angered drivers by allowing a recovery vehicle on track in conditions of poor visibility during heavy rain. Alpine's appeal will be heard at 18:00 Mexico City time (12:00 BST) on 27 October before this weekend's Mexican Grand Prix. The team have questioned the US GP stewards' decision to allow a protest by the Haas team despite it being posted after the permitted time limit had expired. The stewards said in their decision to hand Alonso a 30-second penalty on Sunday that the Spaniard's car was in an unsafe condition because he drove it for some time with a damaged wing mirror, and then without one when it fell off. Haas pointed out their cars have previously been given the black-and-orange warning flag - demanding a car is pitted for repairs - on three occasions in similar situations this season. At no point during the race were Alpine asked by officials to pit the car and remove the mirror, despite calls from Haas to race control. The stewards' ruling suggests that any car missing a rear-view mirror after an incident will be forced to retire in future. There are also questions about the consistency of decision-making, after stewards rejected a similar protest by Haas against Sergio Perez's Red Bull. Perez drove some laps with a damaged front wing, part of which then fell off the car while he was running.
Formula 1 Considers New All-Female Racing Series, https://frontofficesports.com/formula-1-considers-new-all-female-racing-series/, Formula 1 did not support the financially struggling W Series this year, but is looking to launch a potential rival next year. F1 is exploring adding an all-female racing series as soon as 2023. It would have no affiliation with the W Series, which ended its 2022 season three races early due to financial difficulties. The series would seek to place drivers in Formula 2 and Formula 3. The series said that “the required funding due to the business from a recent contracted investment was not received.”Mercedes F1 driver Lewis Hamilton criticized F1 owner Liberty Media for not doing more to support the W Series., Formula 1 did not support the financially struggling W Series this year, but is looking to launch a potential rival next year. F1 is exploring adding an all-female racing series as soon as 2023. It would have no affiliation with the W Series, which ended its 2022 season three races early due to financial difficulties. The new series would be for drivers aged 16 to 22 and include around 12-to-15 drivers. The series would seek to place drivers in Formula 2 and Formula 3. F2 has had one female driver this year, Tatiana Calderon, while F3 doesn’t have any. No female driver has raced in F1 since Lella Lombardi at the 1976 Austrian Grand Prix. W Takes an L The W Series, which coordinated with F1 to race in the same locations and weekends as F1 for much of its season, shut down earlier this month, canceling a race in Austin, Texas, alongside the U.S. Grand Prix and two races in Mexico City. The series said that “the required funding due to the business from a recent contracted investment was not received.” Mercedes F1 driver Lewis Hamilton criticized F1 owner Liberty Media for not doing more to support the W Series. “I think we need to be doing more,” said Hamilton, “with Formula 1 and Liberty doing so well, it’s not a lot for them to be able to help out in that space.”
ESPN’s Formula 1 races will remain commercial-free in new deal “expanded direct-to-consumer rights” also included, https://awfulannouncing.com/espn/espns-formula-1-races-will-remain-commercial-free-in-new-deal-expanded-direct-to-consumer-rights-also-included.html, On Saturday, Disney announced the company’s new rights deal with Formula 1, which was reported this summer. There were some rumblings that after agreeing to the new deal, ESPN might start running ads during races to offset the increased rights fee. In the release announcing the new deal, ESPN made sure to note all race broadcasts would remain commercial-free, with at least 16 races each season airing on ABC and ESPN. Additionally, more qualifying sessions will air on ESPN and ESPN2. The deal contains more content on cable and broadcast, races will remain commercial-free, and it seems like there will be an opportunity for cord cutters to also access some content., On Saturday, Disney announced the company’s new rights deal with Formula 1, which was reported this summer. The company will reportedly be paying between $75 million and $90 million per year in the new contract, up from its current rights fee of just $5 million per year. There were some rumblings that after agreeing to the new deal, ESPN might start running ads during races to offset the increased rights fee. However, that doesn’t appear to be the case. In the release announcing the new deal, ESPN made sure to note all race broadcasts would remain commercial-free, with at least 16 races each season airing on ABC and ESPN. Under the renewal, at least 16 races will air on ABC and ESPN each season, more than in the previous five years since F1 returned to ESPN networks in 2018. Also, all race telecasts on ABC, ESPN and ESPN2 will continue the commercial-free presentation used over the past five seasons, a format that has set ESPN’s coverage apart and proved very popular with viewers. But what piqued our interest was this note about a potential direct-to-consumer offering for Formula 1 on ESPN+. The new agreement also includes expanded direct-to-consumer rights, giving ESPN flexibility to roll out additional ways for fans in the U.S. to consume F1 content over the next three years, including on ESPN+, with details to be announced later. Additionally, more qualifying sessions will air on ESPN and ESPN2. All race weekends will continue to include live telecasts of all three practice sessions and qualifying (including the F1 Sprint) as well as pre-race and post-race coverage. The new agreement includes an increased focus on qualifying, with more sessions airing on ESPN or ESPN2. The deal contains more content on cable and broadcast, races will remain commercial-free, and it seems like there will be an opportunity for cord cutters to also access some content. Overall, this seems like a win for viewers. [ESPN]

Brad Pitt awkwardly snubs Formula 1 reporter on live TV at US Grand Prix, https://pagesix.com/2022/10/24/brad-pitt-awkwardly-snubs-formula-1-reporter-at-us-grand-prix/, The “Bullet Train” actor, 58, gave Sky Sports pundit Martin Brundle the cold shoulder on the starting grid at the US Grand Prix on Sunday. The British journalist, known for his star-studded, pre-race grid walks, attempted to speak with Pitt while live on-air. Brundle, 63, inquired about his upcoming F1 project, which Lewis Hamilton is co-producing, before asking whether he had enjoyed the race weekend in Austin, Texas. “Obviously they’re known as Pitt stops, if they don’t want you to talk to Brad Pitt,” the longtime F1 reporter quipped. scobie/TwitterA third fan wrote, “Not sure I understand the logic of Brad Pitt not wanting to spend just a moment to talk to Martin Brundle during the grid walk., Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Brad Pitt, who will produce and star in an upcoming movie about Formula 1, is under fire for snubbing one of the sport’s most beloved commentators. The “Bullet Train” actor, 58, gave Sky Sports pundit Martin Brundle the cold shoulder on the starting grid at the US Grand Prix on Sunday. The British journalist, known for his star-studded, pre-race grid walks, attempted to speak with Pitt while live on-air. Brundle, 63, inquired about his upcoming F1 project, which Lewis Hamilton is co-producing, before asking whether he had enjoyed the race weekend in Austin, Texas. “Thank you, man,” Pitt simply replied, before brushing past Brundle. “Obviously they’re known as Pitt stops, if they don’t want you to talk to Brad Pitt,” the longtime F1 reporter quipped. Fans of the sport weren’t pleased that Pitt had spent three days conducting movie research with team bosses and drivers alike, but seemingly didn’t realize who Brundle was. Pitt spent three consecutive days in the F1 paddock. Mark Sutton/Motorsport Images/Si “Brad Pitt making a movie about F1 but not knowing who the voice of the sport Martin Brundle is,” journalist Omid Scobie tweeted about the incident. “Brad Pitt.. the man starring in an F1 film won’t even stop for 30 seconds to speak to Martin Brundle… if you don’t wanna be interviewed, get off the grid and make way for people who do,” another person chimed in. Pitt awkwardly denied Brundle an interview. scobie/Twitter A third fan wrote, “Not sure I understand the logic of Brad Pitt not wanting to spend just a moment to talk to Martin Brundle during the grid walk. I mean, this is his moment to connect with those F1 fans that would see his F1 movie.” This isn’t the first time an celebrity has snubbed the presenter. “Bridgerton” star Simone Ashley and “Euphoria” actor Jacob Elordi turned their backs on him in Monaco earlier this year, and he’s previously had awkward interactions with rapper Megan Thee Stallion, and tennis champ Venus Williams. Earlier in the weekend, Pitt was seen schmoozing with F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali and Circuit of the Americas chairman Bobby Epstein as they discussed filming his upcoming movie during real race weekends in 2023. Several sources told Page Six the actor was friendly and spoke to members of each team as he visited almost every garage on the grid. On Friday, he had lunch with Mercedes boss Toto Wolff, Apple CEO Tim Cook and musician Pharrell Williams. The following day he sat down for a traditional Texas BBQ lunch with the Williams Racing boss, Jost Capito, and Wyclef Jean.

McLaren’s Putting Kindle Screens on Its Formula 1 Cars, https://gizmodo.com/mclaren-s-putting-e-ink-screens-formula-1-cars-ads-1849693462, McLaren’s multi-million dollar 2022 Formula 1 car and the e-reader you keep on your bedside table now have something in common: they each feature an electronic paper display.

Putting a corporate sponsor’s logo on a Formula 1 race car isn’t just a way to say thanks, it’s valuable publicity for the company, so much so that after a race it’s someone’s job to calculate just how much screen time a given sponsor’s corporate logo had. Sponsors compete for placement on the limited space a Formula 1 car offers, but that could soon change.

But while your Kindle helps you fall asleep each night, McLaren Racing is instead leveraging the unique display technology to help revolutionize corporate sponsorships. Racing is a big business, especially at the Formula 1 level where a team can spend over a hundred million dollars in a single season. Corporate sponsorships help offset those costs, and enable other companies to benefit from a Formula 1 teams’ efforts.

Sponsors compete for placement on the limited space a Formula 1 car offers, but that could soon change. Advertisement McLaren Racing recently announced a partnership with a company called Seamless Digital to upgrade its 2022 MCL36 cars with electronic paper screens. It’s an idea we’ve seen before. At CES 2022, earlier this year, BMW demo’d an SUV that was completely wrapped in flexible electronic paper from E Ink, allowing the vehicle to dynamically changes its appearance from white to black, or introduce different patterns and designs, without a trip to the paint shop. The BMW iX Flow was just a concept—the carmaker has no definitive plans to offer the E Ink wrap as an official option—but at this past weekend’s United States Grand Prix, McLaren Racing upgraded its MCL36 cars with a pair of electronic paper displays, one on either side of the cockpit, that it plans to continue using during practices for the remainder of the 2022 season.

Buy at Wish Advertisement The displays, which are lightweight and flexible, wrap to the contours of the race cars so as not to affect their aerodynamics, and allow the vehicle’s branding to be changed on the fly, even in the middle of a race. Craig Scarborough shared some additional details about how the display system works on Twitter. They’re powered by the vehicle’s own electrical system and have been tested to endure the heat and vibrations the vehicles are exposed to. They are slightly heavier than traditional decals, but offer the advantage of some better branding opportunities. Advertisement In a spot where a single logo was displayed on a car throughout an entire competition, McLaren Racing can now display rolling branding for several different sponsors, all pre-programmed for specific time intervals, locations, or even programmed to change depending on how the race goes. Sponsors could be given the opportunity to have their logo displayed more prominently while the vehicle was in first place, or pay more to have their logo appear longer while the race car was temporarily sitting at a stop in the pits. The added technology has nothing to do with the performance of the car, and everything to do with increasing the profitability of competing in Formula 1.

It will be replaced on the calendar, with Turkey and Qatar rumoured to be potential destinations.
Alonso dropped out of points following Haas protest at United States Grand Prix, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.alonso-dropped-out-of-points-following-haas-protest-at-united-states-grand.2W3bnKWlLL7wafh6yc9R9V.html, Fernando Alonso has dropped from P7 to P15 in the classification for the 2022 United States Grand Prix, following a protest against his car by rivals Haas. Alonso was involved in a dramatic accident with Lance Stroll on the Circuit of The Americas’ back straight, with the Spaniard getting airborne after making contact with the rear of Stroll’s Aston Martin before miraculously continuing on.

And while the stewards opted not to act in the case of Perez’s car, Alonso’s Alpine A522 was deemed to have been in an unsafe condition following the crash – with a 30-second post-race penalty imposed on Alonso (a 10-second mid-race stop-go penalty no longer being feasible), dropping him from P7 to P15. 2022 United States Grand Prix: Alonso goes airborne in huge crash with Stroll at COTA Writing in their verdict, the stewards noted that they were “deeply concerned that Car 14 [Alonso] was not given the black and orange flag [shown to a competitor judged to have suffered mechanical damage that requires immediate attention in the pits], or at least a radio call to rectify the situation, despite… two calls to Race Control by the Haas Team. “Notwithstanding the above, Article 3.2 of the Formula 1 Sporting Regulations is clear – a car must be in a safe condition throughout a race, and in this case, Car 14 was not. This is a responsibility of the Alpine Team.” READ MORE: Stroll handed three-place grid drop after high-speed clash with Alonso at COTA Arguments from Alpine that similar damage on the cars of Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc at the 2019 Japanese Grand Prix had not received any warning were also considered immaterial.

Formula 1: Max Verstappen gets record-tying 13th win at US Grand Prix, https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/motorsport/300719663/formula-1-max-verstappen-gets-recordtying-13th-win-at-us-grand-prix, Dutch driver Max Verstappen has already retained the F1 drivers' title and is now one chequered flag away from the record for most season victories. Max Verstappen passed Lewis Hamilton late to earn a record-tying 13th win of the season at the United States Grand Prix on Sunday (Monday NZ time), and delivered a victory to honour the memory of Red Bull team founder and owner Dietrich Mateschitz. Verstappen’s race was nearly undone by a rare slow pit stop by Red Bull midway through the race that dropped him well behind Hamilton. Since its founding, Red Bull has won six driver championships and five constructors' titles. Eric Gay/AP Red Bull driver Max Verstappen, of the Netherlands on his way to winning the US Grand Prix in Austin, Texas., Dutch driver Max Verstappen has already retained the F1 drivers' title and is now one chequered flag away from the record for most season victories. Max Verstappen passed Lewis Hamilton late to earn a record-tying 13th win of the season at the United States Grand Prix on Sunday (Monday NZ time), and delivered a victory to honour the memory of Red Bull team founder and owner Dietrich Mateschitz. Verstappen’s race was nearly undone by a rare slow pit stop by Red Bull midway through the race that dropped him well behind Hamilton. But Verstappen fought back to pass last season’s rival for the championship on lap 50 of 56. Verstappen then had to hold off the pestering Hamilton through the final laps as his team warned him not to exceed track limits that would draw a penalty. The win as a relief for Red Bull. The team had announced shortly before qualifying on Saturday that Mateschitz had died at age 78. Verstappen vowed he’d give everything to get the win to honour him. READ MORE: * Red Bull Formula 1 owner Dietrich Mateschitz dies at 78 * Red Bull boss Christian Horner blasts Formula 1 rivals over cheating allegations * Max Verstappen's team guilty of F1 salary cap breach * Max Verstappen takes second Formula One title with Japanese GP win The win continued Verstappen’s run of dominance in 2022. He had already clinched the season championship in Japan two weeks earlier. Sunday’s win tied him with Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel for most in a season with three races still to go. Since its founding, Red Bull has won six driver championships and five constructors' titles. Verstappen's win clinched this season's team championship. Eric Gay/AP Red Bull driver Max Verstappen, of the Netherlands on his way to winning the US Grand Prix in Austin, Texas. Mateschitz, the Austrian billionaire co-founder of the Red Bull energy drinks global empire, bought the Jaguar team in 2004 and rebranded it as Red Bull in 2005. He added a second team to the Red Bull stable when he bought the Minardi program renamed it Toro Rosso in 2006 to be a program for training younger drivers. That team is now Alpha Tauri. The team brought a teenage Verstappen into its racing program and promoted him to F1 in 2015 when he was just 17, with the hopes he could become the youngest champion in series history. Mercedes' dominance over 2014-2020 prevented that. But Mateschitz, who had been reportedly ailing for months and died at age 78, lived long enough to see Verstappen win two championships and start what could be another dominant era for the team he founded. F1 held a brief tribute to honor Mateschitz before the race. Large signs of “Danke Didi” (Thank you, Didi) were posted on the video screens and Vettel, who won four championships with Red Bull and now races with Aston Martin, appeared to be fighting back tears.

We've broken down everything you need to know in order to stream today's race, and all the other F1 races this season. Dan Istitene/Formula 1/Getty Images What is F1 and how is it different from IndyCar? Both IndyCar and F1 are open-wheeled, single-seater racing formats. This means that the cars can only fit one person and have uncovered wheels that protrude from the body of the vehicle. Despite their basic similarities, F1 and IndyCar offer very different experiences. In F1, there are only 10 teams, with two drivers apiece for a total of 20 drivers. Most races must go for 305 km, which is about 190 miles. Each driver needs to use two different tires in the race, so a pit stop is mandatory, though cars are not allowed to refuel. Races average around two hours in length and are held at venues all over the world. Teams spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year developing their cars. All cars must have certain elements -- for example, gearboxes must have eight gears plus a reverse and last for six consecutive races -- but teams have leeway to tweak and change some parts of their car, including their engines, in the pursuit of speed. In contrast, the cars featured in IndyCar are more standardized. They all have the same aerodynamic kit and chassis and can only be powered by one of two engines -- either a Honda or a Chevrolet. That said, teams are allowed to develop some of their own parts, like dampers and some of their suspensions. IndyCar races occur on a wide range of tracks, from fast ovals to road and street courses. The length of the races also varies, with some, like the Indianapolis 500, lasting 500 laps and taking over three hours to complete. Not surprisingly, refueling during pit stops is a big part of the strategy during IndyCar races. Teams can field more than two cars, meaning that the amount of drivers on the grid fluctuates from race to race. IndyCar is mostly considered an American sport and does not have the same level of money and glamour associated with it compared to the globe-hopping F1 circuit. Why should I care about F1? F1 races might best be described as a sort of action-packed chess match that takes place while drivers are throttling around a track at close to 200 mph. Teams need both strategy and skill to compete against some of the best minds in motorsports. F1 is also full of strong personalities. The Netflix documentary series F1: Drive to Survive follows many of the teams and drivers over the course of a year and has helped raise the profile of the sport in the US. Released in March, season four of the series chronicles last year's tight championship race between rivals Verstappen and Hamilton. It also focuses on the internal battles between drivers on the same team, while giving viewers a peek into the tense, pressurized world of elite racing. Does F1 stream on ESPN Plus? ESPN does not air any F1 coverage on its ESPN Plus streaming service. If you want to watch the practices or races you will need a television provider of some kind or to pay for F1's $80 per season TV Pro subscription. When, where and what time are the races? Races are held on Sunday and are usually spaced two weeks apart.

The move is still subject to the young American gaining enough Super License points during the remainder of the F2 season. In order to boost that, Williams have also announced that he'll partake in two more FP1 sessions this season after his impressive debut in Austin. Elsewhere, Pierre Gasly has left AlphaTuari to join French team Alpine where he'll pair up with Esteban Ocon for the 2023 Formula One championship. His replacement at Red Bull's junior team comes in the form of Dutchman Nick De Vries who impressed during his F1 debut with Williams at the Italian Grand Prix earlier in the season. Called up at the last minute due to Alex Albon's illness, De Vries scored vital points for the struggling team which seemingly did enough to impress AlphaTauri where he'll take a seat in 2023 alongside Yuki Tsunoda.

Toto Wolff the Compulsive Perfectionist Behind Mercedes’s Formula 1 Team, https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/10/31/toto-wolff-the-compulsive-perfectionist-behind-mercedes-formula-1-team, Two Formula 1 drivers were killed in the span of three years at Zandvoort in the seventies. Last year’s Mexican Grand Prix attracted three hundred and seventy thousand spectators. The Dutch Grand Prix was the fifteenth of the season, and Mercedes’s best results so far were a couple of second-place finishes. “We’ve not gone from being an eight-time-winning world-championship team to not being able to build cars,” Hamilton said. Under normal circumstances, the Grand Prix would have finished behind the safety car, with the race order intact., Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. A few minutes before the start of the Dutch Grand Prix, which was held last month in baking sunshine at Zandvoort, a beachside racetrack within commuting distance of Amsterdam, Toto Wolff, the principal of the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula 1 team, walked out onto the starting grid. A Grand Prix begins when a row of five red lights above the start line is extinguished, but, for a short time before, the track is a twenty-thousand-horsepower mob scene. Each of the unearthly, long-nosed machines is attended by a mobile I.C.U. of generators, steel trolleys, laptops, tire blankets, and uniformed mechanics in crash helmets and flameproof gear. Umbrellas shroud the drivers’ cockpits. Billionaires stalk the grid. Race marshals hold clipboards in red gloves. The noise is beyond belief: helicopter blades, high-speed wheel guns, the desperate howls of the cars, the massed emanations of the waiting crowd. In Zandvoort, loudspeakers laced the sky with dance music. The afternoon was humid; the air felt saturated. Wolff was at home. He is tall, dark, and Austrian. He could pass for a Sacha Baron Cohen character or for someone who breezes past you in the airport, smelling good, wearing loafers and no socks. He worked the grid in a white shirt emblazoned with the Mercedes star and the logos of twelve other corporate sponsors, black pants, team-issued Puma sneakers, lovable smile. He kissed people’s cheeks, touched elbows, gave impromptu TV interviews, and yelled last-minute thoughts to his drivers. Somewhere in the fumes was death. Two Formula 1 drivers were killed in the span of three years at Zandvoort in the seventies. At one point, I found myself by the pit lane when three cars leaped out, red tail-lights flashing. The speed was like a whip. Wolff, who is fifty, is the best team boss in the recent history of the world’s fastest motorsport. The “formula” of Formula 1 refers to a set of rules, first enshrined after the Second World War, to bring some order to the urge to race dangerous cars on the asphalt of foreign cities. Whereas Nascar is all left turns, cars that look like cars, and spectator-friendly oval tracks, Formula 1 has a madder, purer heart: the oldest courses date from a century ago. Races last around ninety minutes. They twist, sweep, and go down hills, sometimes on existing streets. The cars, which started out as death traps for daredevils, are now specimens of extreme technology, flying algorithms that fight for advantages of a hundredth of a second—the distance of a yard over a three-mile track. The sport is esoteric, but globally so. Last year’s Mexican Grand Prix attracted three hundred and seventy thousand spectators. The Singapore race runs through the city at night. (Drivers can shed six pounds in stress and sweat.) The average television audience for a Formula 1 race is around seventy million people—four times that of the typical N.F.L. game—and the best drivers earn soccer-star salaries and lasting fame. When Ayrton Senna, a three-time world champion, was killed in a race, in 1994, the Brazilian government declared three days of mourning. A million people waited in the heat to pay their respects, and many spoke of their saudade—an inexpressible state of longing for something that is gone. “And here’s where I can tell you’ll never amount to anything.” Facebook Twitter Email Shopping Cartoon by Stephen Raaka Between 2014, when Wolff took charge of Mercedes, and 2021, the team won the world championship eight years in a row—an unprecedented achievement. (In Formula 1, there is a constructors’ championship, for the most successful team, and a drivers’ championship, awarded at the end of some twenty races.) Each team has two drivers. Mercedes’s star is Lewis Hamilton, who earned around sixty-five million dollars last season. During the team’s winning streak, Hamilton won six individual world titles, bringing his career total to seven. No one has ever won eight. “I couldn’t think of a better friend. I couldn’t think of a better boss,” Hamilton told me, of Wolff. Formula 1 is currently surging in popularity, particularly in the United States, in part because of a Netflix series, “Drive to Survive,” which has embroidered the nerdery of the sport with artful camerawork and bitchy insight into the lives of its protagonists. Wolff, who speaks five languages and whose wife, Susie, is a former racing driver, is one of the show’s natural stars. Of the ten team principals in the sport, only Wolff and his archrival, Christian Horner, a Briton who runs the Red Bull team, have ever won a world championship. But, unlike Horner and the rest of his peers, Wolff is also a co-owner of his team. His one-third stake in Mercedes is conservatively valued at around five hundred million dollars. He sees himself simultaneously as a competitor and as someone who is shaping the future of a multibillion-dollar business. “The other team principals, and I don’t mean this in an arrogant way, are incentivized for performance only,” Wolff said. His rivals see this. “He’s playing a game and he is always one move in advance,” one of them told me. But this season Wolff and Mercedes have failed to win a single race. The Dutch Grand Prix was the fifteenth of the season, and Mercedes’s best results so far were a couple of second-place finishes. (In 2020, the team won thirteen out of seventeen.) Hamilton, who joined Formula 1 as a rookie in 2007, has never gone a season without winning at least one race. Ahead of the U.S. Grand Prix, in Austin, on October 23rd, the team was languishing in third place, behind Red Bull and Ferrari—its worst position in a decade. Seeing Wolff and Mercedes lose their way has been as disconcerting as it has been refreshing, like watching Roger Federer shank his serve, the Yankees miss the playoffs, Simone Biles miss the beam. It is understandable, up to a point. “We’ve not gone from being an eight-time-winning world-championship team to not being able to build cars,” Hamilton said. “We just . . . it’s wrong this year.” The ostensible reason was a change in the rules. Every few years, the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile, which has overseen Grand Prix racing since 1906, forces the teams to redesign their cars. Normally, the official logic has to do with safety, or with making it easier for cars to overtake one another, but there is almost always an unspoken motive: to upset the existing order of things and to stop one team from gaining a permanent advantage. In the past, Mercedes profited from these changes, adapting faster than its rivals. But the 2022 reset was unusually far-reaching. One of the aims of the new rules was to reconfigure the downforce generated by the cars, to reduce the amount of “dirty air” left in their wakes and to allow for closer racing. At a preseason testing event in Bahrain, in March, Mercedes’s new car—the W13—appeared to embody the boldest interpretation of this idea. It was skinnier and more futuristic than the rest. “People were looking at that thinking, Wow. Mercedes are going to blow the field away,” George Russell, the team’s other driver, told me. “Within reason, we thought that as well.” But the W13 proved capricious. Data collected in the wind tunnel, or through computer modelling, didn’t pan out on the track. At high speeds, the car bounced, an effect known as porpoising. “My back is killing me!” Hamilton yelled on a long straight in Baku, in June, where the floor of the car repeatedly hit the asphalt at more than two hundred miles per hour. Attempts to resolve the issue only uncovered more problems. “We’ve tried and tried and failed. And tried and tried and failed,” Hamilton said. Andrew Shovlin, Mercedes’s trackside-engineering director, who has a Ph.D. in the dynamics of military logistics vehicles, compared fixing the W13 to peeling an onion. “Even the aerodynamic bouncing manifests itself in about three different mechanisms,” he said. The other reason for Mercedes’s poor performance was a sense of injustice and doom. In 2021, with five laps remaining in the final race of the season, Hamilton was leading the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, on his way to an eighth individual world title and solitary greatness. Hamilton had won the previous three races; he had the car on a string. “He was unbeatable and we were unbeatable,” Wolff said. On lap fifty-three in Abu Dhabi, the race was interrupted by a crash, and then a safety car took over. (In Formula 1, when there is a hazard on the track, a sports car with flashing lights leads a stately, jumbled procession of cars, until the danger is cleared.) Under normal circumstances, the Grand Prix would have finished behind the safety car, with the race order intact. But the race director, an F.I.A. official named Michael Masi, made the decision to divert a group of cars to enable a final lap of racing between Hamilton and the second-place driver, Max Verstappen, of Red Bull. The drivers were equal in points in the world-championship standings. Verstappen was on fresh tires; he slipped past Hamilton and took the title. The F.I.A. later concluded that Masi had made a “human error,” and he left his post. But the result stood.

Officials with the Red Bull racing team at the United States Grand Prix in Austin, Texas, announced Mateschitz's death Saturday. With the growing success of Red Bull, he significantly expanded his investments in sports, specifically motorsports and extreme sports, and Red Bull now operates football clubs, ice hockey teams and F1 racing teams. That's what he did here in F1, proving that you can make a difference," Red Bull team principal Christian Horner told Sky Sports F1.

He was 78. Officials with the Red Bull racing team at the United States Grand Prix in Austin, Texas, announced Mateschitz's death Saturday. There was no immediate word where he died, or a cause of death. Mohammed Ben Sulayem, president of motor sports governing body FIA, said Mateschitz was "a towering figure in motor sport." "The thoughts of all the FIA family are with his loved ones at this time and he will be greatly missed." Mateschitz gained fame as the public face of Red Bull, an Austrian-Thai conglomerate that says it sold nearly 10 billion cans of its caffeine and taurine-based drink in 172 countries worldwide last year. Mateschitz not only helped the energy drink become popular around the world, but also built up a sports, media, real estate and gastronomy empire around the brand. With the growing success of Red Bull, he significantly expanded his investments in sports, specifically motorsports and extreme sports, and Red Bull now operates football clubs, ice hockey teams and F1 racing teams. Red Bull also has contracts with hundreds of athletes in various sports and a deep driver development program to get racers to the top level. "It's been hard news for everyone — what he has meant for Red Bull, and of course the sport, and especially for me," said Max Verstappen, who wrapped up his second consecutive F1 title two weeks ago. Verstappen on Sunday at Circuit of the Americas will try to tie Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel with an F1-record 13 victories in a season, and he'll also attempt to clinch the constructors championship for Red Bull. Enlarge this image toggle caption Oliver Multhaup/AP Oliver Multhaup/AP "What he has done for me, my career so far, and in general my life, it's really tough, it's a really tough day," Verstappen said. "There's still a race ahead and we're going to try to make him proud tomorrow." Mateschitz and Thai investor Chaleo Yoovidhya founded the company in 1984 after Mateschitz recognized the potential in marketing Krating Daeng – another energy drink created by Chaleo – for a western audience. Red Bull says Mateschitz worked on the formula for three years before the modified drink was launched under its new name in his native Austria in 1987. Under Mateschitz' stewardship, Red Bull quickly increased its market share, first in Europe, then in the United States, helped by marketing campaigns promoting the drink's claimed stimulating properties and extensive sponsorship agreements in motorsports, soccer, extreme sports and the music industry. The Red Bull Racing team has enjoyed success in Formula 1, winning the constructors' championship in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, while German driver Vettel won four drivers' championships in row while signed to the team. Verstappen started in Red Bull's driver development program and became the youngest driver in F1 history to start a grand prix when he started with the junior Toro Rosso team at age 17 in 2015. The Dutchman is now the most dominant driver in the sport. "So many of us have to be so grateful to him for the opportunities he's provided and the vision he had, the strength of character, and never being afraid to follow dreams, and chase dreams. That's what he did here in F1, proving that you can make a difference," Red Bull team principal Christian Horner told Sky Sports F1. "We're just incredibly grateful for him, everything that he's done, everything that he's supported us with over the years," Horner added. "So many drivers, so many team members, so many people in this pit lane owe him so much. He was incredibly proud of the team, incredibly proud of everything we've done and have been achieving, and he's been a passionate supporter and the backbone of everything that we do." Red Bull operates soccer teams in top divisions across Austria, Germany, Brazil and the United States. The company started by buying Austrian club SV Austria Salzburg in 2005 and rebranding it in the company colors under the name Red Bull Salzburg. It repeated the move in Germany, where it bought fifth-tier club SSV Markranstädt in 2009, rebranded it as RasenBallsport Leipzig, and financed its steady progress through the league system till it was promoted to the Bundesliga in 2016. German league regulations prevented the company from naming the team Red Bull Leipzig – its name in German, RasenBallsport, means "grass ball sport Leipzig" but the club just refers to itself as RB Leipzig. Mateschitz also made headlines for his populist views. He previously criticized German chancellor Angela Merkel for her handling of the refugee crisis over 2015-16. The Austrian Servus TV station, owned by Red Bull Media House GmbH, is known for promoting right-wing provocative views. Mateschitz bought the Jaguar Racing team from previous owner Ford at the end of 2004 and rebranded it as Red Bull for the 2005 season. Later that year, he then also bought Minardi and renamed it Toro Rosso, astutely using it as a feeder team for Red Bull.

Lewis Hamilton - 103 wins First race: 2007 Australian Grand Prix World Championships: 7 (2008, 2014-15, 2017-20) Number of races: 307 Number of wins: 103 Number of pole positions: 103 Career points: 4363.5 In terms of career wins and total career points, Lewis Hamilton is the best Formula 1 driver to have ever graced a circuit. The Brit has taken wins in 30 different countries, won a race in almost every season he’s competed in, and is currently tied on world championships with Michael Schumacher, having narrowly missed out on taking an eighth world title in 2021 to Max Verstappen. Hamilton holds many of Formula 1’s records and, with a contract that runs to the end of 2023, he looks to be able to push even further ahead on many of them. While he missed becoming champion in his first season by a single point, he became the (then) youngest world champion the following year. Fourteen years later he’s secured six more titles, and is hunting for an eighth. Read more about Hamilton's first 100 wins here.

He was, until the rise of Hamilton, the face of domination in Formula 1: seven titles (five of them consecutive), a seemingly insurmountable number of wins, unrelenting competitiveness – Schumacher changed the game in F1 with his combination of dedication, passion, and, of course, raw talent. While he took two titles with Benetton, he’s far more well-known for his time with Ferrari. He joined the team in 1996 and, after some highs and lows in the following years, the combination struck gold in 2000. What followed in the next five years were five world titles, 48 wins, and a record book that had Michael Schumacher’s name in almost every field. His second stint in F1 wasn’t as successful as his first, yielding a single podium to add to his collection. However, his 91 wins, 155 podiums and 68 pole positions still put him high up in any statistical analysis. See our top 10 Schumacher victories here.

Sebastian Vettel - 53 wins First race: 2007 United States Grand Prix World Championships: 4 (2010-13) Number of races: 297 Number of wins: 53 Number of pole positions: 57 Career points: 3099 While his form in Formula 1 isn’t what it once was, there was a time when Sebastian Vettel was virtually unbeatable. Vettel’s F1 career started in 2007 and, in his first three years, he took nine podiums and five wins, though this was nothing on what was to come. Over the next four years he became the face of F1, winning four consecutive championships and becoming the youngest world champion in the process (taking the accolade from Lewis Hamilton). He also secured the records for most podium finishes in a season, most wins in a season, most pole positions in a season, most laps led in a season, most consecutive wins, most consecutive grand slams, and most wins from pole position in a season. Unfortunately for Vettel the regulation changes in 2014 didn’t suit Red Bull (or him), and the team quickly fell back through the pack. He went from nine consecutive wins in the final nine races of the 2013 season to not winning a single race until 2015, and since that 2013 season he’s ‘only’ taken 14 wins. Despite that he’s still widely regarded as one of the best drivers on the grid, and his list of records is likely to stand for many more seasons. Read more about Sebastian Vettel's top 10 wins here.

Alain Prost - 51 wins First race: 1980 Argentinian Grand Prix World Championships: 4 (1985-86, 1989, 1993) Number of races: 199 Number of wins: 51 Number of pole positions: 33 Career points: 768.5 It was Alain Prost's meticulous style that allowed him to go up against Ayrton Senna – the bitter feud that he is best remembered for. His secret weapon was brainpower, as well as speed, and he possessed a natural precision in his driving that allowed Prost to become France's first world champion in 1985. In 1987 he beat Jackie Stewart's record of 27 wins and a year later McLaren won 15 out of 16 races across the season, which is testament to both Prost and Senna's skill. Prost remained at the top of his game until his retirement, taking his fourth and final title for Williams at 38 years old. Ayrton Senna, McLaren MP4-8 Photo by: Ercole Colombo 5. Ayrton Senna - 41 wins First race: 1984 Brazilian Grand Prix World Championships: 3 (1988, 1990-91) Number of races: 161 Number of wins: 41 Number of pole positions: 65 Career points: 610 One of motorsport's most legendary figures, Ayrton Senna remains the benchmark for raw talent and charisma. His depth of commitment to a lap and his constant desire to push the boundaries for more has meant that Senna has a special place in the hearts of many motorsport fans. His three titles give a sense of what could have been had he not died at the San Marino Grand Prix in 1994. A combination of natural speed and restless ambition gave Senna an edge rarely seen. Such is his legacy that even nearly thirty years after his death, Senna's cars and how he won his greatest F1 title are still talked about. Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB18 Photo by: Mark Sutton / Motorsport Images 6. Max Verstappen - 33 wins First race: 2015 Australian Grand Prix World championships: 2 (2021, 2022) Number of races: 160 Number of wins: 33 Number of pole positions: 17 Career points: 1948.5 Max Verstappen, son of former Formula 1 driver Jos, spent just one year in car racing before making his F1 debut. While he got to grips with the single-seaters in the Florida Winter Series, his junior career is best remembered for his 2014 European Formula 3 campaign when he finished third in the championship behind Tom Blomqvist and title-winner Esteban Ocon. This single season, in which he took 10 wins from 32 races, including six consecutive wins, was enough to earn him the move up to F1, taking a seat at Red Bull sister team Toro Rosso for 2015 and becoming the youngest-ever grand prix driver. His inaugural F1 season returned some success in middle-of-the-pack machinery – 10 points-paying finishes from 19 races – but it was his second season where he really announced his entry in F1. Getting the call up to the senior Red Bull team five races into the 2016 season, replacing the beleaguered Daniil Kvyat, Verstappen took his first win immediately at the Spanish GP, aided by Mercedes team-mates Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton crashing out together on the first lap. He’d take a further nine wins by the end of the 2020 season, before the tweaked technical regulations for the 2021 season resulted in Red Bull producing a car truly capable of fighting for the world title. With the Red Bull much closer to the previously dominant Mercedes car, Verstappen and Hamilton engaged in an arduous, season-long battle for the title. The fight came down to the final lap of the final race, with Verstappen just taking the honours ahead of the seven-time world champion for his first title since karting in 2013. The 2022 championship has been a much easier time for the Dutchman by comparison. Though he failed to finish two of the opening three rounds due to reliability trouble, Verstappen has taken 12 wins thus far, with his win in Suzuka proving enough to take the title. With a second crown to his name, it remains to be seen how many more he can add to his tally. Race winner Fernando Alonso, Renault celebrates on the podium Photo by: Sutton Images 7. Fernando Alonso - 32 wins First race: 2001 Australian Grand Prix World Championships: 2 (2005-06) Number of races: 355 Number of wins: 32 Number of pole positions: 22 Career points: 2045 Fernando Alonso is a two-time world champion with a reputation as a fearless, aggressive racer, though his career can be defined as much by what didn’t come as the two titles he won. The Spaniard spent three years in Formula 1 before scoring the first of his two consecutive crowns, taking the title with a comfortable 21 point lead over Kimi Raikkonen. His second title the year later was a 13-point lead over the great Michael Schumacher, though this is where Alonso’s good fortune seemed to run out. A move to McLaren in 2007 to partner then-rookie Lewis Hamilton saw him finish the season in third, just one point behind winner Kimi Raikkonen and behind Hamilton, who had the same points but more wins. His 2010 move to Ferrari looked like it would pay off as he entered the final race of the season in the lead, but a combination of him getting stuck behind Vitaly Petrov and a win for Sebastian Vettel meant Alonso had to settle for second. He missed the 2012 title by just three points (again to Vettel), and was second again in 2013 (though was 155 points the German). He moved back to McLaren in 2015 – just in time for the disastrous McLaren-Honda relationship – and after four tough years he left at the end of 2018 – just before McLaren made their way back towards the front of the grid. Even the 2021 season was unkind to Alonso – racing for the midfield Alpine team he secured a fourth place at the 2021 Hungarian Grand Prix (the best he’d finished for seven years) while his team mate Esteban Ocon went on to win, though a long-awaited 98th podium finally in Qatar. Despite the terrible luck that Alonso has exhibited in Formula 1 he’s still taken 32 wins, 22 pole positions and 23 fastest laps, and is a firm fan favourite.

Nigel Mansell - 31 wins First race: 1980 Austrian Grand Prix World Championships: 1 (1992) Number of races: 187 Number of wins: 31 Number of pole positions: 32 Career points: 482 Nigel Mansell was another one of Formula 1’s ‘unlucky’ drivers. His career was dogged by reliability issues, and his entire 1988 season consisted of two second-place finishes, two races missed due to chicken pox, and 12 retirements. He managed to finish in second place in the championship three times – missing out on the title by two points in 1986 – and as he entered his 12th full-time season in Formula 1, it looked like he might go down as yet another brilliant driver to miss out on the title. Thankfully for the Brit though, this didn’t happen. Mansell took five consecutive wins to start the 1992 season, going on to claim four more and taking an additional three second-place finishes. This was enough for ‘Il leone’ to take the title at the age of 39 years old, becoming the fifth-oldest person to do so. Jackie Stewart, Tyrell 006 Cosworth Photo by: Motorsport Images 9. Jackie Stewart - 27 wins First race: 1965 South African Grand Prix World Championships: 3 (1969, 1971, 1973) Number of races: 99 Number of wins: 27 Number of pole positions: 17 Career points: 360 It might seem an intrinsic part of F1 today, but Jackie Stewart was one of the first drivers to prove that racers can, and should, strive for better safety standards. As a triple champion and dominant force in the sport, Stewart had the credibility needed to change the culture around safety in motorsport. After seeing too many of his friends and colleagues killed doing what they loved, Stewart was a key pioneer in the introduction of full-face helmets, seatbelts, travelling medical units, safety barriers, runoff areas and more. Outside his quest for safety, Stewart was a prodigious talent on track and was the man to beat throughout his time on the grid, claiming three world titles with Ken Tyrrell's eponymous team as the two formed an irrepressible double-act in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Niki Lauda - 25 wins First race: 1971 Austrian Grand Prix World Championships: 3 (1975, 1977, 1984) Number of races: 171 Number of wins: 25 Number of pole positions: 24 Career points: 420.5 Niki Lauda entered Formula 1 as a pay driver though nobody can deny that, while his money helped him enter F1, it’s his talent that kept him there. With three seasons in F1 under his belt, Lauda joined Ferrari for the 1974 season and secured two wins and fourth place in the championship for 1974, having often set the pace but suffered misfortune. In 1975 Lauda took five wins and the first of his three world titles, but it’s his 1976 season – and the infamous Nurburgring crash – that’s his most famous. He bounced back from a life-threatening crash at the Nurburgring to miss out on the title by one point to James Hunt. He took his second title in 1977 and retired two years later, only to return with McLaren in 1982. That yielded a third crown in 1984, after an epic contest with Alain Prost, before Lauda retired for good at the end of 1985. While he proved his talent on track, he later became known for his business sense off it. He worked in managerial positions for Ferrari and Jaguar, though he’s most well-known for his part in Mercedes. He was instrumental in bringing Lewis Hamilton to Mercedes for the 2013 season, and worked with the team until he passed away in 2019. Read more about Niki Lauda's 10 best races here.

From 1962-65, the Scottish ace was arguably only beaten in the world title when he encountered mechanical issues and at the time of his death in 1968 – tragically during an F2 race at Hockenheim – he held the record for the most race wins. An unrivalled talent, Clark was eight miles clear of the nearest competitor in the torrential rain at Spa in 1963, highlighting the bravery of a driver racing in the most dangerous period of motorsport's history.

Red Bull founder Dietrich Mateschitz passes away aged 78, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.breaking-red-bull-founder-dietrich-mateschitz-passes-away-aged-78.8IH4SaZBqwwfCZWYe3XwJ.html, Dietrich Mateschitz, co-founder and owner of Red Bull, has died at the age of 78. Red Bull confirmed Mateschitz’s passing ahead of qualifying for the United States Grand Prix, where the team can claim their fifth F1 constructors’ title. Mateschitz founded Red Bull in the mid-1980s and turned the energy drink into a market leader, while showcasing the brand through a range of extreme sports. Indeed, Vettel racked up four successive drivers’ titles from 2010 to 2013, with Red Bull also taking the constructors’ crowns in each of those years. As it stands, Red Bull have scored 79 pole positions, 89 race wins, six drivers’ titles and four constructors’ titles in F1., Dietrich Mateschitz, co-founder and owner of Red Bull, has died at the age of 78.

Mateschitz founded Red Bull in the mid-1980s and turned the energy drink into a market leader, while showcasing the brand through a range of extreme sports. Having initially been involved in F1 with Sauber in the 1990s and early 2000s, Mateschitz bought the Jaguar squad at the end of 2004 and rebranded it as a full-blown Red Bull team for the 2005 season. He then bought the Minardi squad, renaming it Toro Rosso for 2006 and using the team as a vehicle to train promising drivers for the works Red Bull operation. Mateschitz has been central to Red Bull’s success in F1 Steadily building up their operation over the following years, while signing the likes of design guru Adrian Newey and promoting the first of many Red Bull-backed drivers in Sebastian Vettel, pole positions, victories and world titles would ultimately flow. Indeed, Vettel racked up four successive drivers’ titles from 2010 to 2013, with Red Bull also taking the constructors’ crowns in each of those years. After a lean spell upon the arrival of F1’s turbo-hybrid era, a reunion with Honda led to another winning period, their latest star driver, Max Verstappen, claiming the 2021 and 2022 drivers’ titles, with the 2022 constructors’ set to follow. As it stands, Red Bull have scored 79 pole positions, 89 race wins, six drivers’ titles and four constructors’ titles in F1. F1 boss Stefano Domenicali hailed Mateschitz as an “incredible visionary” Stefano Domenicali, President and CEO of Formula 1, said: “I am deeply saddened by the news that Dietrich Mateschitz, a hugely respected and much-loved member of the Formula 1 family has passed away. “He was an incredible visionary entrepreneur and a man who helped to transform our sport and created the Red Bull brand that is known all around the world. “I will miss him greatly, as will the whole community in Formula 1, and our thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and the Red Bull and AlphaTauri teams at this very sad time.” Christian Horner said the Red Bull squad were “incredibly grateful” to Mateschitz
Red Bull accuse Formula 1 rivals of 'concerted campaign' over budget cap ruling, https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/63361127, The US Grand Prix is live on BBC Radio 5 Live and the BBC Sport websiteRed Bull have accused their rivals of waging a "concerted campaign for a draconian penalty" for them breaking Formula 1's budget cap. Governing body the FIA has offered Red Bull a so-called breach agreement detailing a suggested penalty. Horner said Red Bull were in talks over this and "wanted closure on 2021". Red Bull have been found guilty of both a 'minor' and a 'procedural' breach of the financial regulations. Horner said that that he was "appalled at the behaviour of some of our competitors", adding that children of Red Bull employees had been bullied in school playgrounds., The US Grand Prix is live on BBC Radio 5 Live and the BBC Sport website Red Bull have accused their rivals of waging a "concerted campaign for a draconian penalty" for them breaking Formula 1's budget cap. Team principal Christian Horner said that "what is in contention is a couple of hundred thousand dollars" in the team's financial submissions for 2021. Governing body the FIA has offered Red Bull a so-called breach agreement detailing a suggested penalty. Horner said Red Bull were in talks over this and "wanted closure on 2021". Details of the FIA's offer have not been made public. Horner's remarks come in the wake of a letter McLaren Racing chief executive Zak Brown wrote last week, and which was first reported by BBC Sport, that said Red Bull breaching the $145m (£114m) cap in 2021 "constitutes cheating". Horner is also angry about interviews given by Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff and his opposite number at Ferrari, Mattia Binotto, at the Singapore Grand Prix last month, when Red Bull's breach first became public knowledge. Red Bull have been found guilty of both a 'minor' and a 'procedural' breach of the financial regulations. A 'minor' breach can be any amount up to 5% of the cap, or $7.25m in 2021. Horner said the 5% window and number of possible punishments listed in the regulations "have contributed to a concerted campaign for there to be a draconian penalty on Red Bull for what at the end of the day we are taking what is probably in contention with the FIA is a couple of hundred thousand dollars." He added: "What has been tremendously disappointing is the leakage that happened. Suddenly we are tried and subjected to three weeks of effective abuse. And then to be seeing a letter accusing us of cheating and being fraudulent, it is just not right, and this has to stop." Horner said that that he was "appalled at the behaviour of some of our competitors", adding that children of Red Bull employees had been bullied in school playgrounds. "For a fellow competitor to be accusing you of cheating, to accuse you of fraudulent activity, is absolutely shocking," he said. "Without any of the facts or details to be making that kind of accusation. "We have been on trial because of public accusations since Singapore. The rhetoric of cheats, that we've had this enormous benefit, numbers have been put out in then media that are miles out of reality. The damage that does to the brand, to pour partners, to our drivers to our workforce." Horner said Red Bull hoped to resolve the talks with the FIA over the breach before the end of the US Grand Prix weekend, but was not able to say whether that would be possible. He said if they could not reach a breach agreement deal with the FIA, the matter would go to the sport's cost-cap adjudication panel and potentially even to the FIA court of appeal. "It could draw it out for another six or nine months," Horner said. "Which is not our intention." Horner said that a rule clarification in June - three months after teams had to hand their final 2021 accounts to the FIA - had changed the way unused parts were assessed under the cap and "had a seven-digit effect on our submission". Sitting alongside him in a news conference, Brown and Williams team principal Jost Capito both said they had not been affected, and Brown said the FIA process had been "quite thorough, quite detailed and very manageable". Horner said: "We had zero benefit from a development or operational perspective either in 2021 or 2022 from the way we operated in the cap. "Our submission was significantly below the cap, we expected certain things to be potentially clarified or challenged as is the process in a brand new set of regulations. But based on professional accounting, external third parties, the expectations to police this was very clear from our side." He added: "Once this situation is concluded, there will be complete transparency and I will talk you through the reasoning behind our submission and why we felt each of the line items that have been challenged we believe there is a contrary position. "The whole thing should be transparent. There is going to be no private, secret deal. It will all be absolutely above board." Up and down the paddock, there is a consensus among rivals that Red Bull should have a significant punishment for the breach, to act as a warning to all teams for the future, otherwise the cost cap will be rendered ineffective. One high-profile figure told BBC Sport they thought Red Bull should be disqualified from the constructors' championship in both 2021 and 2022, losing all their prize money. Another said that if Red Bull had been proven to be difficult with the FIA and tried to hide spending, Max Verstappen should lose the 2021 drivers' title, which was won after a close fight with Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton and in controversial circumstances at the final race of last season. Neither are considered a likely eventuality. It is expected that the probable outcome is that Red Bull will be hit with a significant fine, running into millions of dollars, and a restriction on permitted aerodynamic research and development next year.
ESPN Formula 1 Extend Track With New Rights Deal, https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/espn-formula-sports-rights-deal-exte-1235411754/, The new contract will keep F1 races on ESPN networks in the United States through the 2025 season. The first Formula 1 race ever aired in the U.S. was on ABC in 1962, and ESPN aired races between 1984 and 1997. In 2017, Disney and Formula 1 struck a new rights pact, moving the sport from NBC to ESPN and ABC the following year. ESPN said average viewership “has moved into seven figures in 2022.” Through 18 races, live F1 telecasts are averaging 1.2 million viewers on ESPN networks. “The ESPN networks have played a huge part in that growth with their dedicated quality coverage., Walt Disney Co. wants to keep auto racing on track. The company’s ESPN has extended its current rights deal with Formula 1 racing, a pact sports agents have suggested has become surprisingly lucrative for an agreement not tied to football or basketball. The new contract will keep F1 races on ESPN networks in the United States through the 2025 season. “Formula 1 and ESPN have been a strong and successful team and we’re delighted to extend our relationship,” said Burke Magnus, ESPN’s president of programming and original content, in a statement. “We look forward to serving fans in some new and innovative ways in the next three years as we continue to bring the reach and relevance of the Walt Disney Company networks and platforms to Formula 1.” Under terms of the new deal, at least 16 races will air on ABC and ESPN each season, more than in the previous five years since F1 returned to ESPN networks in 2018. All the race telecasts on ABC, ESPN and ESPN2 will continue to run commercial-free presentation, a format that ESPN says has proven popular with viewers in the league’s past five seasons. What’s more, the new deal expands ESPN’s direct-to-consumer rights, giving flexibility to how it distributes Formula 1 telecasts over the next three years, including on the streaming outlet ESPN. The company said details related to streaming would be announced at a later date. The first Formula 1 race ever aired in the U.S. was on ABC in 1962, and ESPN aired races between 1984 and 1997. In 2017, Disney and Formula 1 struck a new rights pact, moving the sport from NBC to ESPN and ABC the following year. John Malone’s Liberty Media acquired Formula 1 that year for $4.4 billion, and one of its goals was said to be to find new ways to transmit the sport to its fans, including broadband avenues. ESPN said Formula 1 has gained new traction during its recent run with the Disney-backed sports-media giant. Its 2021 season was the most viewed on U.S. TV, with an average of 949,000 viewers watching each race. ESPN said average viewership “has moved into seven figures in 2022.” Through 18 races, live F1 telecasts are averaging 1.2 million viewers on ESPN networks. Earlier this year, the telecast of the inaugural Miami Grand Prix on ABC generated an average viewership of 2.6 million, the largest U.S. audience on record for a live F1 race, according to ESPN. “The ESPN networks have played a huge part in that growth with their dedicated quality coverage. We are excited to expand our relationship and continue to bring the passion and excitement of Formula 1 to our viewers in the US together,” said Stefano Domenicali, president and CEO at Formula 1, in a statement. ESPN intends to create additional ancillary programming on its platforms to support its F1 coverage over the next three years. Some of its popular studio shows , including “SportsCenter,” will continue on-site coverage from races in the U.S., including a new event set for Las Vegas in 2023.

From next year we will have six races in the Americas, which means more favorable time zones to fans in the region, making the Formula 1 offering more compelling than ever.” All race weekends will continue to include live telecasts of all three practice sessions and qualifying (including the F1 Sprint) as well as pre-race and post-race coverage. The new agreement includes an increased focus on qualifying, with more sessions airing on ESPN or ESPN2. ESPN Deportes will continue as the Spanish-language home of F1 in the U.S. and ESPN’s coverage of F1 also includes a dedicated site that reports on the championship year-round.

The development in the saga that has dominated the start of the United States GP weekend leaves Red Bull with a decision over whether to accept the offer and likely a lesser punishment, or go before an adjudication panel. The details of the FIA's offer to Red Bull, however, are still unclear. Red Bull were last week the only team found guilty of exceeding the $145m spending limit from Max Verstappen's maiden title victory last year - with a 'minor' breach meaning they had overspent by less than five per cent ($7.25m) - although have emphatically rejected claims from rival teams that they have purposely cheated.

An ABA, however, has the benefits of drawing a swift line under the cost cap scandal, and a less severe punishment. It allows financial penalties and some 'minor sporting penalties' - but crucially not a points deduction or a reduction in the team's future cost cap, more "damaging" punishments that have been called for by F1 drivers and teams.

Sky Sports has also learned more details of where Red Bull fell foul of the cost cap. One is to do with catering costs, while another is believed to be redundancy and sick pay issues for employees.

When will there be another American Formula 1 driver?, https://sports.yahoo.com/when-will-there-be-another-american-formula-1-driver-151128018.html, So when will an American driver get in on the action? Formula 1 is growing so much in popularity, it’s only a matter of time before it becomes advantageous for a team to have an American driver,” says Scott Speed, the last American to have a full-time Formula 1 seat. “The Formula 1 scene,” says NASCAR champion and IndyCar driver Jimmie Johnson, “could really use a competitive and current American driver in the lineup.”If only saying could make it so. On a broader scale, there’s also this: FIA welcomes American money and viewership, but doesn’t necessarily feel obligated to rush to sign American drivers. They’re killers.”Eventually, an American driver will clear all the financial, logistical and licensing hurdles and reach the grid again., America has never lacked for self-confidence. Our unwavering belief in our national superiority bleeds through into our sports — baseball’s championship is the World Series, despite the fact that exactly two countries participate. And who needs a silly little World Cup when you already have a Super Bowl? The problem for America is that the rest of the world’s sports fans and sporting organizations don’t share the same adulation for all things American. In most cases, that’s fine with American audiences — billions may play cricket around the world, but it’s microscopic in America. But with Formula 1 enjoying an American popularity bump to match its consistent worldwide popularity, Americans looking at the grid — filled with drivers from Europe and Asia — could be left wondering: Why are there no stars and stripes to be seen? Formula 1 wheels back into the United States this weekend at Circuit of the Americas, making the latest of its increasingly frequent visits to American shores. With this year’s phenomenally successful Miami Grand Prix and next year’s Las Vegas Grand Prix joining the established Texas date, F1 is overloading America with European flair, style and controversy. So when will an American driver get in on the action? “It’s an exciting time. Formula 1 is growing so much in popularity, it’s only a matter of time before it becomes advantageous for a team to have an American driver,” says Scott Speed, the last American to have a full-time Formula 1 seat. “It’ll be cool to watch, to have someone be representing us.” “Drive to Survive,” which runs on Netflix and became a pandemic hit, turned Toto Wolff, Christian Horner and Daniel Ricciardo into household names and put the Formula 1 lifestyle — ridiculously wealthy teams, model-quality drivers, exotic locales — right on the screens of Americans and thrived as a result. It’s become so popular that other sports want their own “Drive to Survive,” with tennis, golf and NASCAR all creating their own versions. Story continues The globe-dotting venues — Monaco, Azerbaijan, Singapore — are a selling point for “Drive to Survive,” but they also keep Formula 1 detached from the traditional American sports circuit. (That’s also why it’s so odd seeing Max Verstappen or Charles Leclerc in America, like seeing Santa Claus in the summertime.) The 20-driver grid is filled with Maxes and Lewises and Charles and Sergios, not a Bubba or a Kyle in sight. An American hasn’t even raced in F1 since Alexander Rossi in 2015 and hasn’t won a race in the series since Mario Andretti way back in 1978. “The Formula 1 scene,” says NASCAR champion and IndyCar driver Jimmie Johnson, “could really use a competitive and current American driver in the lineup.” If only saying could make it so. But it also could happen as soon as next season. McLaren driver Daniel Ricciardo of Australia arrives in the paddock on horseback during the Formula 1 United States Grand Prix preview day at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas. (Photo by JIM Watson/AFP via Getty Images) The talent: Can you handle an F1 car? The obstacles for Americans are technical, geographic, logistical and financial. Start with the table stakes: You’ve got to be able to wheel an F1 car with a surgeon’s touch at 220 mph, and that’s not the kind of skill you can develop in a weekend of testing at the track. Most drivers start racing in go-karts well before they’re 10 years old; if you can’t beat fellow fifth-graders, there’s not much chance you’re going to belong on the track with Lewis Hamilton. (The opposite holds true; Formula 1 drivers who have tried their hand at NASCAR have largely struggled, running mid-pack or later before strutting back off to their yachts. Ricciardo, who’s such a fan of Dale Earnhardt that he races under the number “3,” may be the one to change that ... or he may not.) There’s an old sports-radio bit about how LeBron James could have been the best football player ever if he’d gone that direction instead of basketball. It’s in line with the America-centric thinking that believes we’d field a World Cup-winning men’s soccer team if our best athletes weren’t in the NBA and NFL. We’re so good at our sports, the reasoning goes, why wouldn’t we be good at others, too? NASCAR champions Chase Elliott and Joey Logano — and before them, Jeff Gordon, Tony Stewart, Dale Earnhardt and Richard Petty — are so good at maneuvering a stock car in traffic on high banks at 200 mph, so why wouldn’t they be able to do the same thing in Formula 1 if they dedicated themselves to it? Johnson is a case study in the difficulty of jumping from one series to another. After winning seven Cup championships in NASCAR, tied with Earnhardt and Petty for the most all time, he hopped over to open-wheel racing in IndyCar last year and struggled to post anything better than back-of-the-pack finishes. Even the world’s best need years in the cockpit to get anywhere near a podium. Money: Can you afford to drive an F1 car? Beyond just the technical skill, racing is expensive as hell, and traveling to track after track with ever-more-costly equipment drains savings accounts and strains families. It’s the rare driver who has the financial backing to run in the sport long enough to draw the attention of a sponsor or a team who can alleviate some of the financial burden. Moving up from karting to Formula 4, Formula 3 and Formula 2 grows increasingly more expensive with every rung of the ladder, from hundreds of thousands for a single karting season to millions for one of the higher Formula 2 or 3 series. Sponsorships and team backing are essential but rarely guaranteed; it’s why drivers with a direct pipeline to vast vaults of money — like, say, the sons of billionaires — always have an advantage over the talented, penny-pinching unknown. Location: Can you move to Europe? If you want to become a NASCAR driver, you generally need to find your way to North Carolina. If you want to become an F1 driver, you’ll need to start racing in Europe. And for a young driver, that’s a challenging culture shock. “It’s easy to live here in America,” Speed says. “Living in Europe is not easy. Something as simple as having a store open on Sunday morning isn’t the same there.” Speed, the last American driver to run Formula 1 full-time, moved to Europe as a 19-year-old, and began racing for Red Bull starting in 2005. He competed in Formula 1 through the 2007 season, when he switched over to NASCAR. To this day, he still marvels at the diverse experiences of the F1 paddock — yet another challenge for a young American to negotiate. “All the other teams around you are all from different backgrounds. You’ve got your pit stall and your garage, and you might have German, French, Italian, all different cultures,” Speed says. “In a Cup race, everyone speaks English and comes from a similar background and culture. It’s a more accepting feeling, a family atmosphere.” “There is not a lot of investment in America in terms of getting people into the series,” says Lily Herman, who hosts the “Choosing Sides: F1” podcast and writes “Engine Failure,” an F1 newsletter. “It’s a very European-based series, that’s where the infrastructure is.” IndyCar series driver Colton Herta had his sights on Formula 1, but has not earned enough points to be awarded a license. (Photo by Brian Spurlock/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) Licensing: Can you win the races you need to win? Once you’ve got the money, the skill and the logistics nailed down, you need to start winning races. But not just any races — the right races. Drivers achieve eligibility to run in F1 by compiling a total of 40 Super License points, achieved by winning races and performing well in specific series. The FIA (Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile), Formula 1’s organizing body, weights certain races and series heavier than others, and only counts performance on a rolling three-year scale, meaning a driver must have recent evidence of high-level performance. On a broader scale, there’s also this: FIA welcomes American money and viewership, but doesn’t necessarily feel obligated to rush to sign American drivers. This isolationist approach isn’t anything new in the insular sport of racing. Back in the early days of the 20th century, open-wheel drivers around Indianapolis dismissed their stock car-driving colleagues from the South as hillbillies in taxicabs. NASCAR founder Bill France tried to defend his Daytona Beach turf against the tide of talented moonshiners from the hills of Georgia and North Carolina. Californian Jeff Gordon faced stiff resistance when he broke into — and eventually dominated — the entrenched Southern footprint of NASCAR. Talent alone isn’t nearly enough. “The Europeans have an odd relationship with Americans in Formula 1, both fans and drivers. They’re very into the fact that Formula 1 is a Euro-founded sport,” Herman says. “Americans are used to being centered and prioritized in other sports.” Colton Herta: Close, but not close enough If there’s a driver who symbolizes both the hope and the frustration of Americans attempting to race into Formula 1 from the outside, it’s Colton Herta, a 22-year-old IndyCar driver who’s done everything right and still can’t break into the Formula 1 walled garden. The youngest winner in IndyCar history — he was just 18 when he won at Circuit of the Americas, site of this weekend’s F1 race — Herta has the money and the family connections to get within sight of the grid. What he doesn’t have are the points. Herta races for Andretti Autosport in the IndyCar series, and Michael Andretti was close to purchasing an F1 team last year — which would have given Herta a clear pathway to the series. But in the last decade or so, opportunities for new teams to enter the series have vanished — no new teams have entered Formula 1 since 2017 — and driver seats are more precious than ever. Herta had drawn the interest of multiple teams. He tested for McLaren earlier this year. As of September, Red Bull thought enough of Herta that it considered signing him to replace Pierre Gasly at AlphaTauri. But the FIA determined that Herta had not amassed enough Super License points to qualify to race in Formula 1. “The FIA confirms that an enquiry was made via the appropriate channels that led to the FIA confirming that the driver Colton Herta does not have the required number of points to be granted an FIA Super License,” an FIA spokesperson said in a September statement. “The FIA continuously reviews its regulations and procedures, including with respect to Super License eligibility, with the main factors being considered with respect to this topic being safety, experience and performance in the context of the pathway.” Herta’s denial is particularly galling to those who understand the degree of difficulty involved in IndyCar racing. “I’m hopeful behind the scenes that everybody involved recognizes how stout the field is in the IndyCar series,” Johnson added. “The best example is when you watch successful Formula 1 drivers come over and run IndyCar, and you see how difficult it is for them to win a race and run at the front of the field. I think that alone shows just how much talent there is in the IndyCar series, and just how capable the drivers are.” “It seems like the F1 thing has run its course, and seems as if there won’t be an opportunity, which I’m fine with,” Herta told RACER earlier this month. “It was something that I was honestly looking forward to trying, and I still might be able to try in the future.” “Colton is more than ready to go,” Johnson says, “and it’s unfortunate that a technicality based on Super License points would keep the kid from living his dream.” Logan Sargeant could find himself as the lone American F1 driver next season.

He currently sits third in the Formula 2 rankings, which would grant him the 40 Super License points he needs outright. There’s only one seat available on the grid next year, at Williams following the departure of Nicholas Latifi, and it looks like Sargeant's ride to lose. On Saturday, Williams' Jost Capito said Sargeant would drive for the team next year if he has enough points. "After Abu Dhabi, he will be our second driver next year" Jost Capito says @LoganSargeant will race in F1 for @WilliamsRacing next season if he gets enough super license points pic.twitter.com/lg4OePgSkT — Formula 1 (@F1) October 22, 2022 In addition to running in Formula 2 — check off that geographic box — he’s a member of Williams Driver Academy — check off the “connections” box — and he comes from an incredibly wealthy — and also highly litigious, apparently — family, checking that “money” box. He made his first practice run in a Formula 1 car this weekend at the U.S. Grand Prix. All that remains now is for him to gain that Super License qualification. With one race remaining, he’s 11 points ahead of three other drivers. He must finish no lower than fifth in the series to gain the 20 points he needs for his Super License, meaning he has no room to relax. But fortunately for Sargeant, he’s running in F2 rather than in IndyCar. Critics say FIA’s Super License points system doesn’t give sufficient weight to IndyCar races. The champions IndyCar and Formula 2 races each get 40 points outright, but IndyCar’s points drop off quickly from there. While the second- and third-place finishers in Formula 2 also receive 40 points, IndyCar’s receive 30 and 20 points, respectively. “I, like many others, really scratch my head over the fact that an IndyCar driver, especially one running toward the front of the field and winning races, does not have the points to earn a Super License,” Johnson said. (NASCAR’s Cup series champion, by comparison, gains only 15 points.) The problem for any young driver not yet locked into a ride is that the window to Formula 1 is narrow and closes rapidly. As the series locks down younger drivers for longer periods of time, and as increasingly talented teenage drivers fight their way up the pipeline, the series doesn’t stand still for anyone. “The younger generation that’s coming up, at 14, 15, 16, they’re pretty incredible,” Speed says. “They have more information, more experience at a younger age. They’re killers.” Eventually, an American driver will clear all the financial, logistical and licensing hurdles and reach the grid again. When that happens — assuming the “Drive to Survive”-inspired popularity still exists — that driver will instantly become a marquee American athlete. And given how much he'll have to sacrifice and endure to get there, he'll have earned it. “If you want something, in this day and age, and with how connected the world is, it’s always down to how much you want it,” Speed says. “When does your desire fall short of how much work’s required?”
Can Max Verstappen and Red Bull become Formula One's new dynasty?, https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/21/motorsport/max-verstappen-red-bull-formula-one-domination-spt-intl/index.html, CNN —For much of the 2022 Formula One season, Max Verstappen’s inevitable march to a second consecutive world championship felt more like a procession than a competition. “We note the findings by the FIA of ‘minor overspend breaches of the financial regulations’ with surprise and disappointment,” Red Bull said in a statement earlier this month. The FIA has yet to announce how Red Bull will be penalized for breaching the cost cap. “But Red Bull have not only made the best of the new regulations, but they seem to have a driver in Max that is driving at a level that I’ve not seen since Lewis Hamilton. Max Verstappen celebrates becoming F1 world champion with his race engineer, Gianpiero Lambiase., CNN — For much of the 2022 Formula One season, Max Verstappen’s inevitable march to a second consecutive world championship felt more like a procession than a competition. Verstappen wrapped up the defense of his title with victory in confusing circumstances at a rain-soaked Japanese Grand Prix earlier in October, not realizing he had done enough to retain his crown until well after the race had concluded. Mercedes, seemingly unbeatable for seven years with Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg sweeping the titles, never really got out of first gear, while Ferrari – after an impressive start to the season – then fell away. Such was Verstappen’s sheer dominance, the Dutchman became only the fourth driver in F1 history to secure the world championship with four or more races remaining. One caveat that has yet to fully play out regarding Red Bull’s success is that the team breached F1’s cost cap rules in 2021, according to the sport’s governing body the FIA. “We note the findings by the FIA of ‘minor overspend breaches of the financial regulations’ with surprise and disappointment,” Red Bull said in a statement earlier this month. “Our 2021 submission was below the cost cap limit, so we need to carefully review the FIA’s findings as our belief remains that the relevant costs are under the 2021 cost cap amount,” the statement added. The FIA has yet to announce how Red Bull will be penalized for breaching the cost cap. Verstappen’s high level Given the ease with which Verstappen clinched the title and the ever-increasing gap between Red Bull and its rivals, perhaps the most pertinent question going forward is not whether the Christian Horner-led team can win the drivers’ championship again in 2023, but how many can they win in a row? “I think that if you asked me last year after that really tight battle with Mercedes, I would have said it was going to be a bit more challenging to go on the kind of run that Mercedes had done,” Lawrence Barretto, correspondent and presenter for F1, told CNN Sport. “But Red Bull have not only made the best of the new regulations, but they seem to have a driver in Max that is driving at a level that I’ve not seen since Lewis Hamilton. “I think Max is driving at such a high level now that, yeah, I think he probably could go on to not just dominate this era of Formula One – up until 2026 when the regulations will change again – but possibly beyond that because he’s only 25 years old and he could go on if he wants to for 15, 16 years. “As long as he’s winning, I don’t think he’s going anywhere, and Red Bull and Max are just making such good decisions at the moment and everything is operationally working so well that I think we could see a period as dominant, if not more dominant, than Mercedes.” However, both Red Bull and Mercedes know how quickly things can change in F1. After winning both the drivers’ and constructors’ championships for four straight years between 2010 and 2013, Red Bull didn’t taste success again in either until Verstappen won the drivers’ championship in dramatic and controversial circumstances on the final lap of the 2021 season. Despite losing out on the drivers’ championship, Mercedes still claimed a record eighth consecutive constructors’ championship last season, but the team has seen an alarming drop off to its rivals in both championships in 2022. Mercedes has failed to win a race all season and Hamilton’s current points tally of 180 is less than half of Verstappen’s. Max Verstappen celebrates becoming F1 world champion with his race engineer, Gianpiero Lambiase. Peter Fox/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images “I think the positive thing for Mercedes is that if you look at where they started at the beginning of the season and where they are now, they’ve made huge gains in terms of ultimate performance,” Barretto explains. “So, obviously, they’re still not on par with Red Bull and Ferrari, but they’ve shown that once they’ve got a problem and understand it, they can then cure it and make some gains and get lap time.” Verstappen vs. Hamilton The emergence of Verstappen as a challenger – and then successor – to Hamilton’s crown has been without question one of the biggest contributing factors to the power shift at the top of the sport. With both drivers being daring and ruthless and backed by teams with little love for each other, last season gave fans the kind of title race they had been craving since Rosberg edged Mercedes teammate Hamilton to the title in 2016. Having only just turned 25, Verstappen’s peak is still likely ahead of him, while at 37 years of age it is reasonable to question – as has happened at times this season – whether Hamilton’s best years as a driver are behind him. “I don’t think that Lewis Hamilton’s got any worse, I think that he has been faced with a car that is so difficult to drive that he isn’t used to that,” Barretto says. “2013 was probably the last year in which he had a car that he couldn’t really compete at the front with. “He was also the driver who had the more dramatic, risky set ups at the start of the year as they were trying to understand what was wrong with the car. “I don’t think Lewis is any slower than he’s been. If he had the car to win, I think he would have been fighting for the world title this year. “There’s been enough races this year where we’ve seen him deliver the kind of qualifying laps or the race performance to suggest he’s still got it – it’s the car that’s been the biggest issue. “I do think he’s made mistakes this year, but mistakes happen when you’ve got a car that you’re having to hustle or you’re trying outdrive or get more lap time out than it’s capable of doing.” Hamilton also seemed confident in the aftermath of the Japanese GP that Mercedes would be competitive once again next season. “I think for us, we know what the problems are with this car,” Hamilton told Sky Sports. “I believe that we as a team, we’ve not gone from being world champions to not being able to build a good car. I have no doubts we’ll build a better car next year. “Whether or not we rectify the issues from this year, we’ll find out when we get there.” Given the complications teams face with making improvements since the cost cap came into effect in 2021, that may be easier said than done with an number of issues hampering the Mercedes car this season. “I think the problem for them is that the budget cap is going to limit the way you accelerate performance going from one year to the next,” Barretto says. “We’ve got relatively stable regulations from now until 2026 and we’ve also seen in history that actually, when you’re trying to play catch up, every gain you make is great, but it’s such a small amount of lap time each time you do that, that it could take months – if not years – to catch back up. “Red Bull are going to keep pushing ahead because they’ve got this concept at the moment where they feel like they haven’t got near to the very best of what they can do, but they’re on the right path and so for them, it’s not about trying to cure problems, it’s just about trying to understand the package more. “It’s going to be very difficult for Mercedes and, to an extent, Ferrari to catch Red Bull, at least in the interim, next year and in the next two years, but as the regulations mature and the ceiling gets closer, I think they will they will start to close the gap.” Hamilton, who won his second title by the age of 29, is less than a year removed from the kind of form that saw him take the title race down to the final day, so it seems an improvement in the car rather than his driving ability will be the key factor in Mercedes returning to the top of F1 next season. Hamilton says he is confident Mercedes will bounce back next season. Clive Mason/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images The other contenders Of the other 18 drivers on the starting grid, less than a handful have the skill and the car to challenge Verstappen and ensure he doesn’t go on to create F1’s newest dynasty. Given how well the Red Bull car has performed this season, Sergio Pérez no doubt has the machinery to challenge for the title, but the Mexican is yet to show the consistency necessary to win a championship, currently sitting more than 100 points behind teammate Verstappen. Charles Leclerc is widely considered the best young prospect in F1 besides Verstappen, racking up five wins and 22 podiums by the age of 24, but his Ferrari team has failed to consistently match either Red Bull or Mercedes for pace and reliability. The Monegasque driver boasted a 34-point lead after the first three races of the season, but three DNFs and some patchy form saw his title aspirations gradually vanish. George Russell, Hamilton’s Mercedes teammate, will likely be another name to watch out for at the top of the standings in the years to come, in particular if Mercedes can fix its struggling car, but the young Briton still has a long way to go to prove he can match Verstappen and Pérez in F1’s new generation of stars. “Mercedes, because of their run of form in recent years and their run of success, I think they are still well-placed because when they’ve got a car that is capable, everything else is so strong operationally, development rate, driver quality, they’ve got everything there,” Barretto says. “In the next couple of years, it’s probably Ferrari that have got the best chance of really pushing Red Bull and I say that because they’ve got that younger, more exciting future spec lineup and they’ve got a car that, if they can tighten things up strategically, learn how to get the best out of the package more efficiently, they do offer a greater threat. “But they are so unpredictable as a team, it’s so difficult to to put all your eggs in their basket year-on-year because you don’t really know what version of Ferrari you’re going to get that year, so I think it will be interesting.”
United States Grand Prix: Formula 1 working on new female racing category, https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/63353328, The US Grand Prix is live on 5 Live and the BBC Sport websiteFormula 1 is working on a new women's racing category aimed at opening up pathways for female drivers to the top of the sport. The idea is for it to complement the W Series, which curtailed its season early after financial difficulties. F1 insiders say the new category will definitely become a reality and that financial backing will be in place. The emergence of the new series comes a day after seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton said F1 and governing body the FIA should do more to support women racing drivers. The future of the W Series remains uncertain., The US Grand Prix is live on 5 Live and the BBC Sport website Formula 1 is working on a new women's racing category aimed at opening up pathways for female drivers to the top of the sport. The idea is for it to complement the W Series, which curtailed its season early after financial difficulties. The plan is for the new series to launch as early as next year. F1 would not provide further details but a spokesperson said it was committed to ensuring greater opportunities for women to progress. F1 insiders say the new category will definitely become a reality and that financial backing will be in place. There could be between 12-15 seats available and it is aimed at women from the age of 16. It is being designed to create a clear pathway for rising female talent to reach their potential. The emergence of the new series comes a day after seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton said F1 and governing body the FIA should do more to support women racing drivers. Hamilton said: "There has not been enough focus on women in the sport the whole of F1's life and there is not enough emphasis on it now. And they are not magnifying enough the great work that is being done there. "There is not enough representation across the board in our industry and there is not really a pathway for those young amazing drivers to get to F1 and then you have some people say there is never going to be a female F1 driver, and that's not a good narrative to be putting out. "We need to be doing more. With F1 and Liberty (Media, the sport's commercial rights holders) doing so well, it is not a lot for them to help out in that space." The future of the W Series remains uncertain. The series boss Catherine Bond-Muir said the 2022 championship was being ended two races early after backing fell through and to provide time to find new financial support for 2023.

W Series, which aims to be a feeder for women into F1, was supposed to hold its penultimate round of the year in support of this weekend's United States GP, however fundraising issues led to them curtailing their season early.

What will it take to get F1's next female driver? It has been 30 years since there was a woman racing in F1, and Sky Sports F1's Danica Patrick and Jenson Button had their say on the subject during Friday's practice build-up. "I don't know if it is necessarily in the form of a series as much as it is a culture and accepting and giving them a chance," said Patrick, widely renowned as the most successful woman in the history of American open-wheel racing. "I come from a unique position where I just came up through the ranks, I didn't drive in a female series, there was no female-oriented element to it. "I am a girl and I know that played into me having opportunities with sponsors but that still came up through the classic ranks so really what it takes to stick around and make it to the top is that you are given really good rides along the way and are able to show your talent.

"I think there are definitely sponsors that jump on board because it is unique to sponsor a girl and they will get a lot of attention- but what it takes is that belief and faith that they are going to make it all the way to the top. "I don't think that it is necessarily a sponsor not going all the way to the top, it is a driver having all the talent to go to all the way to the top. "There are plenty of men that don't make it all the way so they just need to be at the right place at the right time and be given good opportunities with a good car. "I always knew in my heart that if I was given the opportunity with a good car I could show them what I was capable of and fortunately it worked out for me and my career and that is what just has to happen." Button, the 2009 F1 world champion, added: "I think for me, having W Series, I was never a big fan of separating men and women in racing but I also think it is great for the young kids and the young girls having a role model like Jamie Chadwick as a driver. "When you look at youngsters, there is a very small percentage of women that actually want to go on and race cars and I think it is because they can't see it."

Formula 1's American Street Races Were Doomed to Fail From the Start, https://jalopnik.com/formula-1s-american-street-races-were-doomed-to-fail-fr-1849570629, For years, Formula 1's Long Beach Grand Prix succeeded against all odds. Much of that money went to the restoration of the Queen Mary, but in 1975, Pook was finally awarded his Long Beach Grand Prix. From Caesars Palace Grand Prix:Pre-race press also noted the involvement of the Long Beach General fund in the motorsports promotion. Street circuits, though, are a cruel mistress, and every Phoenix Grand Prix was plagued by retirements. The country went without a Grand Prix for nearly a decade when it debuted at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway., For years, Formula 1's Long Beach Grand Prix succeeded against all odds. There was no reason why a race at a run-down port city should have worked, but it did, and the sport spent years trying to reclaim the glamour of a race it allowed to die with several other ill-conceived street events around America that tried — and desperately failed — to capture the attention of the American fan. This blog is part of a series on Formula 1's presence in America. The sport has had a storied — but not particularly successful — history in the country. As F1 grows in America, and as we approach the 2022 United States Grand Prix, Jalopnik is taking a look back at the venues left in the dust and what ultimately led to their abandonment. You could, perhaps, forgive F1's hubris when it came to street races because it had managed to put together an extremely successful event in Long Beach that truly should not have worked. Chris Pook, a former travel agent turned race promoter, saw potential for a Monaco Grand Prix-style event in America and set his sights on the town of Long Beach, California thanks to its proximity to Los Angeles. Advertisement Pook’s plan really shouldn’t have worked. In the late 1970s, Long Beach was a fairly depressing industrial port city that was soon swept up in a corruption scandal and would require over $100 million in redevelopment to prepare it to host an international event, Randall Cannon writes in Caesars Palace Grand Prix. Much of that money went to the restoration of the Queen Mary, but in 1975, Pook was finally awarded his Long Beach Grand Prix. The FIA-sanctioned event for 1976 was previewed by a 1975 Formula 5000 race. At the time, Formula 5000 was hugely popular among American open-wheel drivers, and even international talents like James Hunt, Jody Scheckter, and David Hobbs would travel Stateside to compete alongside the likes of Mario Andretti, Al and Bobby Unser, and Sam Posey.

From Caesars Palace Grand Prix: Pre-race press also noted the involvement of the Long Beach General fund in the motorsports promotion. “Long Beach city officials agreed to advance $400,000 that was already scheduled in the master plan,” reported the Los Angeles Times, “and to pay another $101,500 for special reinforcing, pavement, curbs, and safety barriers that will be paid back by the race promoters.” Amid the federal investigation and increased scrutiny at City Hall, the public investment in the otherwise private for-profit promotion would become a flashpoint. “The city is being paid of extraordinary costs, such as extra police,” was the terminology offered to the public.” The Los Angeles Times also touted the investment and financing of the Long Beach Grand Prix Association itself. Building on a $40,000 start-up investment by Chris Pook and his partners, “additional funding is being arranged through a special intrastate public offering to raise from $950,000 to $1,575,000 for operational and organizational expenses.” Advertisement With the funds ultimately earned, the Formula 5000 race at Long Beach was set to run. Drivers lauded the unique safety measures and the guts it took to actually host an event in the middle of a city — especially considering the circuit felt refreshingly modern when compared to the ailing Watkins Glen International. The finances weren’t quite as promising. Pook admitted that he had overestimated the number of people who would buy a ticket to the event, and the first Long Beach race reported a loss of $300,000. Advertisement Things also declined heading into the track’s 1976 event. The barriers seemed to have closed off some track surface, and the asphalt was crumbling. At the end of the event, it appeared that Pook had once again overestimated attendance figures, with financial documents showing yet another massive loss. The 1977 race took place despite Pook and other organizers owing $150,000 to FOCA, a union composed of British teams. After its initial growing pains, though, Long Beach became known for its exciting races, and it took on a huge level of significance after Watkins Glen lost its race date ahead of the 1981 season. There was still a problem, though: As reported in the Indy Star, Pook was essentially putting together a $6 million event in the hopes of making $100,000. That was largely due to the massive fees F1 charged an event venue just to show up at its locale. For the 1984 season, Pook decided to throw F1 to the curb and allow Long Beach to become a premiere event for CART, a progenitor of the modern-day IndyCar series. Advertisement Pook’s decision highlighted a significant problem that was growing in F1: The sport was just too damn expensive, and the requirements it levied on its tracks were absurd. Successful tracks in America didn’t need to spend millions to draw F1 in order to host a successful racing event; they could make a profit by drawing in smaller crowds for a CART event. As a result, F1's options for race venues in America became... rather strange. First came the chaos of F1's first trips to Las Vegas, where it took over 75 acres of Caesars Palace’s parking lot to host a race. (Compare that to, say, the 1,000 acres available at Watkins Glen, and you’ll start to get an idea of the scale here.) The track was wide enough to facilitate some overtaking, but the mid-day races and the strains of a counter-clockwise circuit made the track one of the most difficult on the calendar. Advertisement Once again, forces aligned in such a way that very few people showed up to either race, resulting in massive financial losses to Caesars Palace, Cannon writes in Caesars Palace Grand Prix. After the 1982 Grand Prix event, Caesars Palace hosted two years of CART before giving up on the prospect of transforming a parking lot into a race course. Even before the dream at Caesars Palace totally died, though, Chris Pook was already trying to establish another foothold in America. The 1982 F1 season made history for being the first year that featured three races in the same country thanks to the June addition of the Detroit Grand Prix alongside Caesars Palace and Long Beach. Advertisement The race ran for five years, but part of Detroit’s interest in the event was rehabilitating the image of the once-great Motor City, and the decline of the city showed in a rough track surface prone to falling apart that even initially included a railroad crossing. Problems were evident from the start. The 1982 Detroit Grand Prix was supposed to kick off with a Thursday practice session, but it was cancelled, and Friday’s qualifying had to be postponed due to organizational issues. As the years passed, even changes to the track layout failed to prevent high levels of attrition, and the mid-summer timing often resulted in unpredictable weather. When the last race was staged in 1988, it was so disgustingly hot and humid that the drivers struggled in the cockpit. Worse, the weather resulted in more significant track decay. Paired with a regular loss of money when it came to hosting the event, Detroit’s fate was sealed. Advertisement Formula 1 considered moving the track to Belle Isle, a park near Detroit’s downtown, but the series was ready to hang up its American hat in the Motor City. Instead, CART took over the Belle Isle track, and IndyCar has raced there ever since. During Detroit’s run came yet another American venue, this time in Dallas’ Fair Park for 1984. I’ll just let a quote from Randall Cannon’s Caesars Palace Grand Prix set the appropriate tone: Bill Weinberger of Caesars Palace and promoter Jack Long would be involved in both races [in Las Vegas and Dallas]. “[The] Detroit race was perhaps,” recalled Weinberger, “the biggest clusterfuck in which I have ever been involved.” Advertisement In Dallas, F1 tried to blend entertainment with Texas automotive history by hosting a fan festival in conjunction with Carroll Shelby and the TV show Dallas, but money ran low early. According to Caesars Palace Grand Prix, the race missed its first scheduled installment payment to FOCA and Bernie Ecclestone, even though a race co-sponsored by Texas oil money and Saudi Arabian conglomerate money should have been swimming in cash. The event was something of a joke. No one seemed to realize that a midday Texas race at the start of July would make for a very hot affair, and as The American Legacy in Formula 1 notes, the track surface simply melted away when under racing duress. Only eight cars out of 25 starters finished, and when all was said and done, the Dallas Grand Prix corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in early 1985. It, like Sebring and Riverside, would join the list of one-and-done events in America. Advertisement Even after Las Vegas, Dallas, and Detroit folded, Formula 1 still believed in the street race concept, and in 1989 through 1991 came the Phoenix Grand Prix. Phoenix’s race arose out of the city’s desire to host an international sporting event and the cancellation of the Detroit Grand Prix. Bernie Ecclestone wasn’t ready to relinquish F1's American dream quite yet and simply replaced Detroit with Phoenix for the event’s proposed 1989 date — which, yet again, took place in June. The heat played a role in the break-up of the track surface once again, prompting the race to be moved to a March season opener for the subsequent two years. Street circuits, though, are a cruel mistress, and every Phoenix Grand Prix was plagued by retirements. Advertisement And then it ended. In August of 1991, Ecclestone sent a fax to the City of Phoenix to say that F1 would still race at the event in March of 1992, so Phoenix hired a new consultant to whip the event into shape. In early October, though, Ecclestone called to announce F1 would not be returning to Phoenix. He agreed to pay the city $1.2 million but declined to mention exactly what the cause was. Now, commentators assume the combination of Phoenix only building 20,000 seats and the end of apartheid in South Africa (which renewed the interest in a Kyalami race) both led to to the decision. In 2017, new Formula 1 CEO Chase Carey critiqued Ecclestone’s handling of American races, stating that to truly succeed, America needed longer-term F1 races that will “capture people’s imagination. You don’t do that with Phoenix, but in New York or Miami.” Advertisement Beyond all that, though, was one simple fact: F1 didn’t really know what it wanted from America in the street-circuit era. It knew it wanted to capitalize on an interested market, especially as open-wheel racing grew in popularity throughout the 1980s and ‘90s — but instead of looking at how to host an event for the fans, F1 personnel and promoters focused primarily on how much money they could make off of an event. And while money is perhaps the most important element of any business transaction, creating a long-term investment would have been more profitable in the long run. That, though, was never F1's prerogative. It just wanted to make money. It didn’t care about making fans. After the failure of Phoenix, F1 was tired of dealing with America, and America was in no desperate need for F1. The country went without a Grand Prix for nearly a decade when it debuted at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. How could racing in the heart of America’s motorsport scene go wrong?
Lewis Hamilton says Formula 1 budget cap's future depends on Red Bull sanction, https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/63339364, Lewis Hamilton also said there remained a lack of diversity in F1Lewis Hamilton says the future of Formula 1's budget cap depends on the punishment Red Bull are given for breaching it last year. Red Bull committed a "minor" breach of the $145m (£114m) cap last year, governing body the FIA has said. The offer, the details of which are confidential, specifies the penalty the FIA would hand out if Red Bull accept they breached the cap. What they [Red Bull] have done is done." Red Bull have not commented on the matter publicly since releasing a statement last week insisting that they believed they were within the cap., Lewis Hamilton also said there remained a lack of diversity in F1 Lewis Hamilton says the future of Formula 1's budget cap depends on the punishment Red Bull are given for breaching it last year. Red Bull committed a "minor" breach of the $145m (£114m) cap last year, governing body the FIA has said. Hamilton said: "If they are relaxed with these rules, all the teams will just go over. "Spending millions more and only having a slap on the wrist is not going to be great for the sport." He added: "They might as well not have a cost cap in the future." The FIA has made an offer to Red Bull for the terms of what is known as an "accepted breach agreement" for them breaching the cost cap. The offer, the details of which are confidential, specifies the penalty the FIA would hand out if Red Bull accept they breached the cap. Red Bull, who continue to insist that they were within the cap in 2021, have the choice of accepting they were in breach and taking the penalty, or fighting the judgement. If they contest it, the matter will go to an adjudication panel of independent experts in financial law to decide whether Red Bull were in breach and what penalty to impose. Hamilton lost a tight championship fight with Red Bull's Max Verstappen in 2021 in controversial circumstances after the FIA's race director failed to apply the rules correctly in a safety-car period at the final race of the season. Asked for his reaction to the FIA's announcement and what consequences Red Bull should face, Hamilton said: "The integrity of the sport is where the decisions hopefully will be made. "I do believe Mohammed [ben Sulayem, the FIA president] and his team will make the right decisions, I have to believe that. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt. What they [Red Bull] have done is done." Red Bull have not commented on the matter publicly since releasing a statement last week insisting that they believed they were within the cap. The board of management at Red Bull Racing is discussing its response to the FIA's offer and team principal Christian Horner is expected to make a public statement on Friday at the US Grand Prix. Verstappen said at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin on Thursday: "It is between the team and the FIA, and from our side we have a strong belief that we were in it, so that's why we are discussing with them about it to show what we think is right." Alpine driver Fernando Alonso, who lost two close title fights against Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel in 2010 and 2012 when he was at Ferrari, said: "This has been always part of F1. This is a new thing we implemented recently, the cost cap, but there were always things aerodynamically that you could explore, some grey areas. "And always people who won the championships, they won exploiting that grey area. And then the other teams copy and they eventually get to that level or they ban that thing that was allowed for one or two races." Alonso also drew parallels between Red Bull's situation and the controversy over Ferrari's engine performance in 2019. The FIA announced after that season that they believed Ferrari's engine was not always operated within the rules but could not prove it. They reached a private settlement with the Italian team, whose engine performance dropped markedly for the 2020 season. Alonso said: "Ferrari won I think two races in 2019 with something we all knew was not legal and nothing happened. They kept those wins. It's quite amazing. Imagine that they won the championship in 2019 with that engine. It is very difficult and we need to rely on the people who have the power and trust them." Ferrari team Mattia Binotto said in an interview with BBC Sport in May this year: "What we were doing at the time was pushing somehow the line of interpretations. As a matter of fact, it wasn't illegal, or we would have been disqualified." Hamilton says F1 should back W Series Hamilton also said that he believed F1 and the FIA should step in to try to support the female-only W Series, which was set to race in Austin this weekend but has cancelled the final three races of its season because of financial difficulties. Hamilton, who has been pushing for greater diversity and inclusion in motorsport since 2020, said: "There has not been enough focus on women in the sport the whole of F1's life and there is not enough emphasis on it now. And they are not magnifying enough the great work that is being done there. "There is not enough representation across the board in our industry and there is not really a pathway for those young amazing drivers to get to F1 and then you have some people say there is never going to be a female F1 driver, and that's not a good narrative to be putting out. "We need to be doing more. With F1 and Liberty [Media, F1's commercial rights holders] doing so well, it is not a lot for them to help out in that space."

Max Verstappen: Formula 1's 'bull fighter' & the family that shaped him, https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/59555388, Max Verstappen was two and a half when his parents first realised he might be on the path to being a racing driver. An F1 driver father and an accomplished kart racer for a mother. Max Verstappen - now 25 - was essentially born to be an F1 driver. Karting is the arena in which all F1 drivers learn their trade before graduating to single-seater car racing - formula cars. Frits van Amersfoort is a Dutch racing team owner who ran Max Verstappen in Formula 3 in 2014., Max Verstappen, aged two years and eight months at the 2000 European Grand Prix at the Nurburgring, where father Jos finished 13th This is a revised version of an article first published in December 2021. Max Verstappen was two and a half when his parents first realised he might be on the path to being a racing driver. The boy who became the man who ended Lewis Hamilton's reign as Formula 1 world champion in such dramatic fashion - and became a double world champion amid chaotic scenes at Suzuka on Sunday - was "in the garden every day on a quad bike," recalls Jos Verstappen, Max's father, a former grand prix driver who scored two podiums in a career spanning 1994-2003. "On the second or third day after he got it, he went on two wheels, had to adjust the steering and went side-on into the wall. Luckily, he was wearing a helmet, which got scratched. But he didn't mind. "He was driving all the time. He had a feeling with an engine. Didn't matter whether it was a quad bike, an electric jeep - you know, the small things for children - or whatever. He was always busy with driving. Every day he needed to be on it." Max, as Jos puts it, "grew up with go-karts". They were a racing family - his mother Sophie Kumpen is a former top-level karter who as a teenager competed against future F1 drivers Jenson Button, Jan Magnussen, Giancarlo Fisichella and Jarno Trulli. Jos says: "I didn't want him to start too early. I wanted to start around six. I think that's a good age to start - at least they understand a bit better." But little Max had other ideas. A couple of years after the garden incident on the quad bike, Jos was away at a race in Canada with his own kart racing team when his phone rang. Max was at a race track near their home in Genk in Belgium with family members. "He was half-crying," Jos recalls. "He was four and a half and there were younger people driving and he wanted to drive as well. So that's when it all started." That was 2002. By the end of 2003, Jos's own F1 career had fizzled out. "After that, I put 100% into his career, really," he says. "That was my job." What follows is a story of love and dedication, ending in the emergence of a driver of incredible capability and talent. An F1 driver father and an accomplished kart racer for a mother. Max Verstappen - now 25 - was essentially born to be an F1 driver. Once that became clear, his father then effectively programmed him as one, too. "Without my dad I wouldn't be sitting here right now," Max says. "Since he stopped racing in F1, he basically spent all his time preparing me in the best way possible. We grew up together, he was my go-kart mechanic. Driving with the van from Holland or Belgium to all the go-kart races all over Europe." After the tears in Genk, Jos bought Max what is known as a baby kart. "We still have that go-kart," Jos says. "It is hanging in the Verstappen shop. I remember the first time he got in it. They are not fast, but immediately he was flat-out everywhere and the thing was vibrating so much that the carburettor was falling off all the time. "So after one day of driving that thing, I bought him a mini-kart, which we had to adjust a lot because he was so small. Then it went better." Initially, Jos says, it was more a case of "let's see what happens". That quickly became "let's get to Formula 1". "If he didn't have the talent, I wouldn't go so deep into it, because go-karts are very expensive if you do it internationally. So we were practising. "But you could see, compared to all the children of his age, he was definitely a lot further (on) than the others. Also, we were competing against children two or three years older and that makes quite a big difference." Max took part in his first kart race when he was seven. His rivals were as old as 11. He won. "It was tough," Jos says, "because the tyres were soft (and grippy) and at the end of the race you could see he was tired. But that showed his character, the way he was competing. He didn't mind if other people were older or whatever, he wanted to win. You could see that was always inside him." Verstappen posted this photo on Instagram with the caption: 'Always wanted to be a mechanic!' How 'deep' did the Verstappens go into tutoring Max as a future F1 world champion? "How long have you got?" Jos says. "Let's say it like this. When he was nine or 10, the next step was the junior category. We went in the winter, from November onwards, every weekend to Italy after school. "School finished at 2:30pm. I was waiting in the van. He got in the van and I drove to Italy. We would spend two days at all the circuits he needed to drive on and then Sunday afternoon around 5pm I packed up and we drove back. That's about 1,250km (780 miles) each way. Then in the morning, I dropped him off at school again. "Italy is where all the competition is, where all the factories are, and I wanted him to learn all the tracks and I wanted to see where we were in terms of speed, in terms of engine, chassis and things like that. "So I prepared ourselves really well and he loved it. Us two in the van going there. He was sleeping all the time. You see a lot of things happening on the track and on the way you talk about the situations to tell him how it should be - really educational about how to race. "It was the same here in Genk. Probably two or three times a week we were on the racing circuit and even when it rained, we didn't care. Even when it was -2C and we had to test something, we went there. "After five laps, he'd come in, his hands were frozen. I said: "OK, go in the van and warm yourself up.' And after five minutes I got him out of the van and he had to drive again. It was not always pleasant for him but I think that created his character as well a little bit. "He saw how much effort I put in and he hasn't seen anything different and that's how he is as well. He is very determined and motivated." Verstappen (centre of the drivers), pictured in March 2010, aged 12, celebrates victory at La Conca, Italy, on his KF3 debut It wasn't long before Max was making waves in the tight-knit Dutch motor racing community. His father's name guaranteed attention - Jos was at that point the most successful F1 driver the country had produced - and Max's results did the rest. Karting is the arena in which all F1 drivers learn their trade before graduating to single-seater car racing - formula cars. Karts don't have gears, and drivers sit on them rather than in them, but in all other ways they are like mini racing cars. And Max was a natural. As the titles piled up, it became very obvious that Max was heading for big things. People began to notice - and to hear about just how much effort his father was putting in. Frits van Amersfoort is a Dutch racing team owner who ran Max Verstappen in Formula 3 in 2014. It would be his only year in single-seater racing before progressing to F1. "Together Jos and Sophie built a baby which had the right genes," Van Amersfoort says, "and then after a while Max was programmed to be a race driver. "I remember Andre Agassi was built by his father as a tennis robot, by getting 3,000 balls each day around his ears. Jos was like that. In the karting years, as far as I heard, it was sometimes un-human, how the two of them worked together, how Jos prepared and programmed his son to be the best racing driver in the world." There were ups and downs, of course. Max was a phenomenon, but he was also just a kid. Looking back now, he says the singularity of purpose that has been so evident in his F1 career was formed on the karting tracks as a child. "That's what counts," Max says. "That's how my dad taught me to live. You have to focus on yourself and work with your team. Everything else doesn't matter." It's easy to say, but is it easy to do? "After spending a lot of years with my dad, yes." How did he do that? "In a lot of different ways. Nice ways. A bit more angry ways. No, it works for me. I needed it. He made me toughen up, which is good." Jos says: "Yeah, sometimes he needed it, absolutely. Sometimes he was not focused and playing and things like that, and when I had that feeling I told him because also I had to develop a lot of things and I went to circuits to test and to find out if it is good. And if he is playing around, I didn't have the right feedback." Did Jos set out to make his son tough? "I think it's a little bit how I am, so yes," he says. "Did I do it deliberately? Probably no, because I'm like that as well." By late 2013, Max was 16, and world champion in the highest kart racing category. It was time to move up to car racing. Verstappen, pictured in April 2014 at Silverstone, which hosted the first round of that F3 season Jos wanted Max's first trial in a single-seater to be low-key. He contacted the Anglo-Dutch Manor MP team, and they suggested a private test in their Formula Renault car at Pembrey, a little circuit in south Wales that was occasionally used for junior single-seater races. Pembrey has been developed since, but back then it did not even have pit garages. "I think they were quite shocked," says Manor MP team manager Tony Shaw, who ran the day, "to arrive and just find a track and some sheep and a scrutineering bay." The Verstappens had booked two days and on the first day it was raining. "Jos wanted to delay letting Max out," Shaw says. "He didn't really want to let him straight out in the rain. He wanted to let it dry up. But we were like, 'No, let's just get out and get on with it.' "He was really nervous, I have to say, and you don't expect that of someone like Jos Verstappen, but he was pacing around all over the place." He needn't have worried. "Max was absolute dynamite right from the off," Shaw says. "A pleasure to work with. We were like, 'Is this really his first test?' But he was really in control, really, really quick; completely natural without any bother whatsoever." Manor, as it happens, also gave Hamilton his first run in a racing car, in 2001. The circumstances were different. Where Verstappen had a track to himself, Hamilton was at a group test, with all manner of other cars around of varying performance levels, and the test was at Mallory Park, another tiny circuit, in Leicestershire, not so far away from the UK's motorsport hub. "When Lewis drove we were a little bit worried because there were lots of other cars on track and he seemed more eager," Shaw says. "Within 10, 15, 20 laps, he'd a had a bit of a shunt and ripped a corner off. He demonstrated a different way of not being afraid of it, by grabbing hold of it and throwing the thing around, whereas Max was fast but much more controlled. And he didn't really make any mistakes. "We just thought: 'Wow.' He was truly impressive. Max was definitely one that you knew was going to shine. With both of them you knew straight away." Verstappen did a few more Formula Renault tests over that autumn and winter, and was quick everywhere. Jos and their manager Raymond Vermeulen decided they could skip that category and go straight for Formula 3. It was a bold move. F3 is a technical, sophisticated category that uses what are effectively scaled-down F1 cars. It is normally very much not for beginners. But then Max was very much not normal. Max and Jos, pictured in Hungary, April 2014, at F3 testing with the Van Amersfoort Racing team The Verstappens approached Van Amersfoort, who they knew of old. Jos, who was a prodigy himself back in the day, had raced for his team in 1992 in Formula Opel Lotus in his own first year of car racing, before moving on to F3 in 1993 and then making the jump to F1 with Benetton as Michael Schumacher's team-mate in 1994. The idea was to compete in the European Formula 3 championship. "We were running out of time," Van Amersfoort says. "It was already February before it was decided. We ordered a car but Dallara couldn't deliver it. So we borrowed a chassis. We built a car around it, did one run-out in Most in the Czech Republic and then went to the first official test in Budapest. "Max was quickest from the first hour on. That's a Verstappen. They keep amazing you. Any Verstappen, whether it's Jos or Max, they will always astonish you with what they can do. Their drive to be fast is so phenomenal, so intense. "It sounds a bit weird, but after one day inside the team, we said to each other: 'We could put Max in an F1 car tomorrow.' After one day. That's the truth." Max won 10 races that year, one more than Esteban Ocon, but lost the title to the Frenchman - himself now also an F1 driver - largely because of an engine failure at a race towards the end of the season. The punishment for it was 10-place grid penalties at three separate races. Verstappen's performance was a revelation. Soon, both the Mercedes and Red Bull F1 teams were expressing interest in signing him. By August, Verstappen had joined the Red Bull driver programme. Shortly afterwards, before he had even driven an F1 car, they signed him to race for their Toro Rosso junior team in F1 in 2015. In September, Verstappen had his first proper run in an F1 car and earned the licence he needed to drive at a grand prix weekend for the first time. He took part in the first practice session at the Japanese Grand Prix. And in 2015, he became the youngest ever F1 driver at 17 years and 166 days. Fourteen months after that, he was promoted to the Red Bull senior team after four races of the 2016 season. He won on his debut at the 2016 Spanish Grand Prix. Verstappen was 18 years and 228 days old when he won the 2016 Spanish Grand Prix It is hard to explain to someone not fully versed in motor racing how extraordinary it is for a driver to come straight out of karting into a complex category like F3, with downforce and all the complications that brings, and take to it like he has been doing it all his life. Drivers are meant to go step-by-step through the junior categories. F3 would normally be the second or more likely third category they do, and many drivers spend more than one year in each category. Only the special ones need just one year in each, never mind just one in anything, before reaching F1. "It's only possible when you have an extraordinary driver," Van Amersfoort says, "and we felt from the beginning that Max was like that. And again, I can't repeat it enough, with the knowledge of Jos. "We're not talking about a simple driver coach. Jos was everything, and we accepted that from the beginning. We knew our skills as a team were maybe less than the skills of the Verstappens together. But combined we made it into a success. "And we had discussions. We nearly had fights. But altogether, the year was tremendous." The 2014 F3 season was a success, but a demanding one for Van Amersfoort. "The story is that the Verstappen family is not easy to work with," he says. "They have high expectations. They don't settle for second, they don't settle for a learning year. They just want to be there from the beginning. They go for the best and nothing else." To illustrate Max's determination and single-mindedness, Van Amersfoort recalls an incident at the end of that year. As has become traditional, the F3 season ended with a race in Macau in China, where all the leading drivers from the various championships compete together on a fast and dangerous street circuit that is held in admiration and awe by drivers around the world. Macau is characterised by a long pit straight, on which slipstreaming is a key part of racing, and a tight and demanding back part of the circuit, as the cars twist and turn through the city's hills. As a track, it's like Monaco but more difficult and much faster. Macau is also notorious for crashes at the first corner of the race. Max should have won Macau. He was running second in the qualifying race, which would have been the perfect place to start the main event, as he could slipstream the pole position car down to the first corner. But his determination to win overcame logic. "Max was P2 in the qualifying race but he didn't give up," Van Amersfoort says. "He crashed the bloody car trying to win pole. That's Max. "Then in the feature race on Sunday, there was a pile-up, like usual in Macau, and Max's car was badly damaged. The only way to continue was to get back to the starting grid, but all the marshals told him to get out because they wanted to tow it away. "He refused to get out. He stayed in the car and there he was, hanging from a crane as they lifted it free of the crash. As soon as they put him back on the track, he drove back on three wheels to the grid and we were able to repair the car. He ended up finishing seventh from the back. "This incredible drive, this incredible internal will to win, I haven't seen anything like that before, and I've seen a lot of race drivers." Throughout Verstappen's F1 career, that will to win has been very clear, partly from his manner out of the car, his straightforwardness, his absolute singularity of purpose. But also from the way he drives. Verstappen takes aggression to the extreme, something that has become one of the defining aspects of his battle with Hamilton this year. He just will not back down in a wheel-to-wheel fight, even when other drivers would, because racing ethics say they should. If he's on the inside, he will push the other driver wide; if he's on the outside, he will turn in on them and compete, regardless of whether standard practice would dictate they have won the corner, and he should really concede. That's how he races. Jos says he "doesn't know" where Max developed that style. "He did it in go-karts," he says, "so I don't see anything different. When he sees the gap, when he has that feeling he can overtake, he will go for it." But Van Amersfoort says: "Jos was driving like that, too. That comes from Jos. We had so many visits to the stewards in the F3 year and it was always the same. A Verstappen can't lose. They can't bear the fact that they have lost." Red Bull team principal Christian Horner, who raced against Verstappen's mother in karting, agrees: "That came from his dad. His mum was a smart racer. He's got the aggression of his dad and the racing head of his mum." If that approach was passed down from father to son, though, not everything was. Van Amersfoort says: "Max has the rough side of Jos, and the racing skills, but he has the social sides of his mother. Max as a human being is completely in the middle of his father and his mother. "If he was too kind, or maybe a bit too much of Sophie, he would not be such a good racer. If he would be too much like Jos, he would be the same sort of race driver as Jos and in the end there would have been tears. But he is exactly in the middle." Max is Jos' son. Jos guided him to become the driver he is. But he's not Jos. Max can be short with people. And there is a roughness about him that sometimes comes out - in 2018, after he had had incidents in all the first six races of the season, he said he "might headbutt someone" if journalists kept asking him why. But as a character, he differs from his father. "He's always been relaxed when I put pressure on him," Jos says. "He was like: 'OK, it will be fine, don't worry.' And he's like that now." Max says: "My dad sometimes was a bit worried that I couldn't be bothered or I was too relaxed, but I said: 'Dad, don't worry. This is just the way I like it and how I approach to get into a race weekend or, like, my zone.' "Up until F1, he was still worried about it, but he also could see that he couldn't affect that bit of my preparation. Still nowadays my dad is more excited about starting the F1 weekend than I am. I get sent so many things, my dad asking questions about the weekend, and I am like: 'I will find out when I get to the track.'" Max gave this answer in an interview in the summer of 2021. I mentioned it to Jos. "He doesn't feel the pressure, that's the thing," Jos says. "He doesn't even think about it. "He thinks: 'If my car is fast enough to win a championship, I'll win the championship. If not, I will finish second.' "Everybody sees - and you see it as well - how talented he is. And all the teams in the paddock want Max at the end of the day. And that makes us comfortable as well." Back home in the Netherlands, Max has become a sensation. For some years now, races held in central Europe - in Belgium, in Austria, in Hungary - have been mobbed by Dutch fans, all wearing T-shirts in the national colour of orange, all supporting Verstappen with a fervour that matches, at least, that shown for Ferrari in Italy. Last year, the Dutch Grand Prix returned to the calendar as the historic seaside resort of Zandvoort held a race for the first time since 1985. It did so because the Dutch organisers and F1 itself wanted to cash in on the Verstappen phenomenon. It has been a roaring success. For four days, there is essentially a national party in honour of Verstappen. The little holiday town is festooned with Verstappen banners. Grandstands are packed. At the track, house music plays from morning to night. "The enthusiasm of the Dutch people for Max is incredible," Van Amersfoort says. "Five years ago, the whole Dutch community was behind our national football team. All these people now are behind Max. They forgot about football." Why did he cause such a reaction? "We Dutch," Van Amersfoort says, "we don't like the polished world champion. We like the raw guy fighting for it. We like the bull fighters. And the Verstappens are like that."

His closest title rival Charles Leclerc starts second but, put simply, Verstappen will be crowned champion if he wins the race with a fastest lap bonus point, although there are plenty of other permutations should he not manage that.

Mercedes' George Russell was eliminated from contention after failing to score points at the last race in Singapore. Verstappen needs to be 112 points clear after the race at Suzuka to ensure he has clinched the title with four races of the season to go, which would make him only the fourth driver after Michael Schumacher (2001, 2002 and 2004), Nigel Mansell (1992) and Sebastian Vettel (2011) to secure the crown with four races left. Including the upcoming Grand Prix in Japan, there are a maximum of 138 points up for grabs across the remaining races if fastest lap bonus points and the eight for winning the sprint race at next month's Brazilian Grand Prix are taken into account along with the 25 awarded for Grand Prix wins.

Victory at Suzuka will see Verstappen crowned champion if Leclerc finishes lower than second. However, victory with the bonus point for the fastest lap will ensure he retains his title irrespective of where the Ferrari man finishes. Verstappen also has the advantage of head-to-head in terms of the tiebreaker of race wins, currently leading Leclerc 11-3, should the two end the year level on points. A win in Japan would ensure Perez can no longer win the title no matter where he finishes in the race. What if Leclerc or Perez finish ahead of Verstappen? Verstappen will not be crowned champion in Japan if Leclerc or Perez finish ahead of him. He would therefore have to wait until the following race in the USA to potentially seal the title.

If he fails to win in Japan, Verstappen needs to score a minimum of eight more points than Leclerc and a minimum of six more points than Perez to be crowned champion. If Verstappen finishes second, Leclerc would have to finish higher than sixth or to keep the title race alive. Fifth is only good enough if he gets the fastest lap. Perez could prolong the title race by finishing fourth or third if Verstappen takes the bonus point. If Verstappen finishes third with the fastest lap bonus point, Leclerc will have to finish fifth or higher or Perez needs to finish a minimum of fourth to deny him. If the reigning champion finishes third without the bonus point, sixth place for Leclerc or fourth place for Perez will be enough to keep the title race going beyond the weekend.

2023 Formula 1 driver market: Which drivers are going where?, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/2023-f1-driver-market-who-driving-where/10376211/, Confirmed 2023 driversDriver 1 : Lewis Hamilton – The seven-time champion is contracted to Mercedes until the end of 2023. AlpineEsteban Ocon, Alpine A522 Photo by: Alessio MorgeseAlpine has not come out of the 2022 driver market dealings smelling of roses. Driver 2: Oscar Piastri – The Australian has been at the centre of the driver market storm. Driver 2: No driver confirmed – The incumbent Mick Schumacher has shown flashes and scored his first and second F1 points finishes this season. 2023 F1 free agentsFor the four (Alpine, Haas, AlfaTauri, Williams) plum F1 seats left up for grabs, listed below are the leading candidates., Red Bull Max Verstappen, Red Bull Racing RB18 Photo by: Alessio Morgese Even before Red Bull streaked well clear of Ferrari in the 2022 constructors’ championship, it had both drivers signed up for next season. Stability is the name of the game as an uber-long deal to retain Max Verstappen means he will again lead the outfit over compliant team-mate Sergio Perez. Confirmed 2023 drivers Driver 1 : Max Verstappen – Red Bull has the reigning world champion under lock and key, with Verstappen contractually committed to the team until 2028 after signing a five-year extension earlier this season. The deal could net the driver up to €50million a year. : Max Verstappen – Red Bull has the reigning world champion under lock and key, with Verstappen contractually committed to the team until 2028 after signing a five-year extension earlier this season. The deal could net the driver up to €50million a year. Driver 2: Sergio Perez – After winning this season’s Monaco Grand Prix, the Mexican let slip on his way to the podium that he’d just inked a new deal. Days later, it was announced that Perez had signed on until 2024. But he will need to address his late-campaign slump in form. Ferrari Charles Leclerc, Ferrari F1-75 Photo by: Alessio Morgese Ferrari chairman John Elkann wants Maranello to win a drivers’ and constructors’ title before 2026, specifically with “Charles Leclerc in pole position”. Just as well the Monegasque has agreed a long-term deal with the Scuderia. Similarly, stablemate Carlos Sainz is going nowhere for next year. Confirmed 2023 drivers Driver 1 : Charles Leclerc – Leclerc has been a part of the Ferrari family since 2016, when he joined the Driver Academy. And it seems he’s staying put for a while yet, the team’s leading light having inked a contract to remain a part of the Prancing Horse’s stable until 2024. : Charles Leclerc – Leclerc has been a part of the Ferrari family since 2016, when he joined the Driver Academy. And it seems he’s staying put for a while yet, the team’s leading light having inked a contract to remain a part of the Prancing Horse’s stable until 2024. Driver 2: Carlos Sainz – To enthuse the tifosi ahead of the 2022 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix on Ferrari’s doorstep, a two-year extension to keep one-time F1 winner Sainz on board until the end of 2024 was revealed. That will take his stay with the team to at least four years. Mercedes Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes W13 Photo by: Andy Hone / Motorsport Images Lewis Hamilton considered walking away from F1 after the controversial events of Abu Dhabi last year. But he has returned to lead the team in the ground-effect era and help the rapid progress of George Russell. The Brits will again pair up in 2023 as they seek to return the Silver Arrow to success. Confirmed 2023 drivers Driver 1 : Lewis Hamilton – The seven-time champion is contracted to Mercedes until the end of 2023. Forget those who suggested he should retire early to save face after being beaten initially by George Russell, for Hamilton’s stance is softening. It looks like he will remain with the three-pointed star beyond his current deal. : Lewis Hamilton – The seven-time champion is contracted to Mercedes until the end of 2023. Forget those who suggested he should retire early to save face after being beaten initially by George Russell, for Hamilton’s stance is softening. It looks like he will remain with the three-pointed star beyond his current deal. Driver 2: George Russell – There’s no escaping that once Hamilton walks away, Russell will become the new face of Mercedes in motorsport and take the battle to Messrs Verstappen and Leclerc. Hence why he is on a “long-term” deal, although no end date has been publicly specified. Alpine Esteban Ocon, Alpine A522 Photo by: Alessio Morgese Alpine has not come out of the 2022 driver market dealings smelling of roses. It dillydallied with Fernando Alonso’s contract, causing the Spaniard to seek pastures new. And it upset Oscar Piastri enough to cause F1’s ‘next big thing’ to look elsewhere. So, there’s a space alongside Esteban Ocon. Whatever Alpine eventually decides to do, it’s set to have knock-on effects down the grid. Confirmed 2023 drivers Driver 1 : Esteban Ocon – There’s little denying that Ocon’s stock has fallen in 2022 after being roundly trumped by Alonso. But he remains secure. The lofty French racer must now lead the team into battle for the remainder of his contract, which expires in late 2024. : Esteban Ocon – There’s little denying that Ocon’s stock has fallen in 2022 after being roundly trumped by Alonso. But he remains secure. The lofty French racer must now lead the team into battle for the remainder of his contract, which expires in late 2024. Driver 2: Pierre Gasly – With Alonso and Piastri gone, Alpine played the field and secured Pierre Gasly who was at the top of its wishlist. McLaren Lando Norris, McLaren MCL36 Photo by: Alessio Morgese McLaren has got its man, having poached Formula 2 and 3 champion Oscar Piastri from the books at Alpine. The hot prospect will partner Lando Norris, who has pledged his future to the team but now needs a car capable of allowing him to fight with Verstappen, Leclerc and Russell into the late 2020s. Confirmed 2023 drivers Driver 1 : Lando Norris – Norris is locked in at McLaren well beyond just next season, having earlier this year committed his future to the team until 2025. The question is, given his talent, how long will it take the Woking squad to give him a car capable of winning races? : Lando Norris – Norris is locked in at McLaren well beyond just next season, having earlier this year committed his future to the team until 2025. The question is, given his talent, how long will it take the Woking squad to give him a car capable of winning races? Driver 2: Oscar Piastri – The Australian has been at the centre of the driver market storm. The Contract Recognition Board ruling in McLaren’s favour saves a few quid, as the team was going to buy his services for 2023 come what may. Daniel Ricciardo, meanwhile, makes way to allow Piastri to arrive on a two-year deal. Alfa Romeo Valtteri Bottas, Alfa Romeo C42 Photo by: Steven Tee / Motorsport Images The Alfa Romeo branding for the Sauber team will be removed at the end of next season. But ahead of an Audi takeover, continuity is the order of the day for this Swiss squad as Valtteri Bottas stays put and impressive 2022 rookie Zhou Guanyu has been given another year to prove his worth. Confirmed 2023 drivers Driver 1 : Valtteri Bottas – The Finn replaced compatriot Kimi Raikkonen for 2022 and has enjoyed emerging from the shadow of Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes. He has led Alfa Romeo with distinction and, with a “multi-year” deal in his pocket, fancies sticking around for the Audi entry in 2026. : Valtteri Bottas – The Finn replaced compatriot Kimi Raikkonen for 2022 and has enjoyed emerging from the shadow of Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes. He has led Alfa Romeo with distinction and, with a “multi-year” deal in his pocket, fancies sticking around for the Audi entry in 2026. Driver 2: Zhou Guanyu – The Chinese rookie reckons he experienced 10 years’ worth of F1 action in 2022 alone – see his points finishes and huge Silverstone smash. A lack of mistakes has earned him a one-year extension for 2023. Now he must close the 0.35s gap to Bottas. Haas Kevin Magnussen, Haas VF-22 Photo by: Zak Mauger / Motorsport Images Charismatic team boss Gunther Steiner has been blowing more cold than hot when it comes to discussing the future of Mick Schumacher at the team. The driver’s camp isn’t all that impressed with that. But the impressive F1 return of Kevin Magnussen will create some continuity for 2023. Confirmed 2023 drivers Driver 1 : Kevin Magnussen – The Dane returned to F1 on the eve of the campaign to replace ousted Russian racer Nikita Mazepin on a two-year deal. That followed a season of sportscar racing in America. Magnussen has been the clear team leader at Haas so is going nowhere. : Kevin Magnussen – The Dane returned to F1 on the eve of the campaign to replace ousted Russian racer Nikita Mazepin on a two-year deal. That followed a season of sportscar racing in America. Magnussen has been the clear team leader at Haas so is going nowhere. Driver 2: No driver confirmed – The incumbent Mick Schumacher has shown flashes and scored his first and second F1 points finishes this season. But he has not taken a major step to match Magnussen regularly. That and, in the age of budget caps, twice splitting the car in two as part of huge shunts has left his future hanging in the balance. Daniel Ricciardo, Antonio Giovinazzi and Nico Hulkenberg are the humdrum candidates to replace him. AlphaTauri Yuki Tsunoda, AlphaTauri AT03 Photo by: Glenn Dunbar / Motorsport Images With Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez carrying on at Red Bull, its junior team drivers at AlphaTauri at first appeared on course to be kept in a holding pattern. But with the recent uncertainty over Pierre Gasly’s future as he considers a switch to Alpine, Yuki Tsunoda might expect a new sparring partner. Confirmed 2023 drivers Driver 1 : Yuki Tsunoda – There’s no denying Tsunoda is rapid on his day, extremely hot-headed and prone to error. But it’s the first factor that has seemingly carried the most weight and earned him a third season in F1 with AlphaTauri with a one-year extension. : Yuki Tsunoda – There’s no denying Tsunoda is rapid on his day, extremely hot-headed and prone to error. But it’s the first factor that has seemingly carried the most weight and earned him a third season in F1 with AlphaTauri with a one-year extension. Driver 2: Nyck de Vries – With a deal done to see Pierre Gasly freed from his contract to join Alpine, AlphaTauri moved to grab de Vries as his replacement. Initially, Red Bull driver programme boss Helmut Marko wanted IndyCar star Colton Herta to come in. But since the American has insufficient points for a superlicence, de Vries became the first choice. Aston Martin Lance Stroll, Aston Martin AMR22 Photo by: Steven Tee / Motorsport Images Team owner Lawrence Stroll didn’t hang around. As his four-time champion driver Sebastian Vettel set up an Instagram account to reveal his F1 retirement, the Canadian quickly entered successful talks to sign a marquee replacement in Fernando Alonso. Naturally, he will partner Lance Stroll. Confirmed 2023 drivers Driver 1 : Fernando Alonso – The 41-year-old has exited stage left from the Alpine-branded Enstone team where he won his two titles. The party line is that the new factory and major investment at Aston Martin will grant him greater success faster. He’s got a “multi-year” deal to work with. : Fernando Alonso – The 41-year-old has exited stage left from the Alpine-branded Enstone team where he won his two titles. The party line is that the new factory and major investment at Aston Martin will grant him greater success faster. He’s got a “multi-year” deal to work with. Driver 2: Lance Stroll – As the son of team owner Lawrence Stroll, the terms of Lance’s contract regarding length and renumeration remain the stuff of speculation. But it’s reasonable to assume the seat is Lance’s for as long as he wants it, or until his dad sells up. Williams Alex Albon, Williams FW44 Photo by: Erik Junius Alex Albon has done a fine job replacing George Russell as the Williams team leader in 2022, so no surprise as he stays. But with Nicholas Latifi sent packing and the second seat at Williams not attractive enough for Oscar Piastri, there’s a 2023 drive on offer to one of two F1 newcomers. Confirmed 2023 drivers Driver 1 : Alex Albon – When the silly season truly got going, Williams swiftly announced Albon had agreed an extension with the team to ward off suitors. The Thai-Brit has a “multi-year” deal in his pocket, the new paperwork also allowing him to break away from Red Bull. : Alex Albon – When the silly season truly got going, Williams swiftly announced Albon had agreed an extension with the team to ward off suitors. The Thai-Brit has a “multi-year” deal in his pocket, the new paperwork also allowing him to break away from Red Bull. Driver 2: No driver confirmed – With Nicholas Latifi’s three-year deal signed in 2020 coming to an end, there’s a vacancy at the Williams inn. After his starring Italian GP cameo in September, Formula E champion Nyck de Vries is the frontrunner. But the Dutch racer also has admirers at Alpine and AlphaTauri, which might lead Williams to promote its American Formula 2 racer and driver academy member Logan Sargeant. In the event he misses out on a top-five finish in the junior series to secure enough superlicence points, Jack Doohan might gain an unexpected opportunity. Moves for Daniel Ricciardo and Mick Schumacher also can’t be entirely ruled out. 2023 F1 free agents For the four (Alpine, Haas, AlfaTauri, Williams) plum F1 seats left up for grabs, listed below are the leading candidates. Some are Formula 2 students looking to take the next step in their career. Others are more experienced and have had their GP shot, gone away, but are in the frame for a return. And then there’s the current F1 stars who will become free agents at the end of 2022 or might still rip up their existing contract and move elsewhere to ensure the silly season stretches on. Antonio Giovinazzi – The former Alfa Romeo racer is rapid on his day, but struggled to match a declining Kimi Raikkonen across three seasons as team-mates. Since leaving F1, he’s been tooling around at the back of the Formula E grid with the perplexing Dragon Racing squad. But his value to Ferrari as a simulator driver has earned a Haas FP1 outing at Monza and linked him with replacing Mick Schumacher for 2023. Giovinazzi has also tested for Alpine but perhaps only to act as a benchmark for fellow contenders Nyck de Vries and Jack Doohan. – The former Alfa Romeo racer is rapid on his day, but struggled to match a declining Kimi Raikkonen across three seasons as team-mates.

Giovinazzi has also tested for Alpine but perhaps only to act as a benchmark for fellow contenders Nyck de Vries and Jack Doohan. Daniel Ricciardo – Ricciardo has had his contract with McLaren cut short, as the team dropped him a year early in favour of getting his fellow Australian Oscar Piastri in the door. The eight-time F1 race winner has been linked as Mercedes’ test driver, and has publicly said he’s open to a year out if he can make more progress in 2024 and has stated he won't be on the grid for 2023 unless something dramatic became available. Daniel Ricciardo, McLaren Photo by: Steven Tee / Motorsport Images Jack Doohan – The son of legendary motorbike racer Mick Doohan has been testing the 2021 Alpine car as part of the team’s lengthy evaluation process to find a replacement for Alonso and Piastri. The rookie Formula 2 racer’s inexperience, though, is a major detractor. But a not wholly unrealistic year or two at Williams could help his learning curve. – The son of legendary motorbike racer Mick Doohan has been testing the 2021 Alpine car as part of the team’s lengthy evaluation process to find a replacement for Alonso and Piastri. The rookie Formula 2 racer’s inexperience, though, is a major detractor. But a not wholly unrealistic year or two at Williams could help his learning curve. Logan Sargeant – The young American blew his chance of a late surge to the FIA Formula 2 title spoils following five DNFs in nine races. But he is still on course for a top-five result in the championship, which would grant him sufficient points to earn a superlicence should he receive a call-up from Williams. He is on the team’s books as a driver academy member. – The young American blew his chance of a late surge to the FIA Formula 2 title spoils following five DNFs in nine races. But he is still on course for a top-five result in the championship, which would grant him sufficient points to earn a superlicence should he receive a call-up from Williams. He is on the team’s books as a driver academy member. Mick Schumacher – There’s not been the major step forward in his second F1 season to show he is a regular enough match for, let alone quicker, than team-mate Kevin Magnussen. Only two points finishes and twice wrecking his Haas car to the tune of $1million a pop means Schumacher’s time at the American team is almost certainly coming to an end. There’s talk of him cutting ties with Ferrari. If he did that, he would likely turn his back on a decent Hypercar drive also. He cannot be totally ruled out from joining Alpine, since good friend Esteban Ocon has nominated Schumacher as his first choice to replace Alonso. He is also in the conversation concerning the second Williams seat. – There’s not been the major step forward in his second F1 season to show he is a regular enough match for, let alone quicker, than team-mate Kevin Magnussen.

The 35-year-old has featured twice for Aston Martin in 2022 when Sebastian Vettel was sidelined with COVID-19 so has some experience of ground-effect machinery. He is also in the discussion for Alpine. Nico Hulkenberg, Aston Martin Photo by: Jerry Andre / Motorsport Images The others – IndyCar hot property Colton Herta controversially hasn’t got the required superlicence points so will likely settle for private tests and FP1 outings only. Red Bull junior Liam Lawson will probably be limited to Friday action also. Jack Aitken has a remote chance of moving to Williams should de Vries look elsewhere and Sargeant not gain a superlicence. Pietro Fittipaldi’s lucrative backing keeps him in the frame for a Haas seat. Alfa Romeo reserve Robert Kubica has long odds to gain a full-time drive, while the Italian-Swiss squad’s protégé Theo Pourchaire underwhelmed by not winning the FIA Formula 2 title at his second attempt. Meanwhile, axed Williams racer Nicholas Latifi looks to have run out of full-time F1 options.

Paul di Resta adamant Formula 1 "can't rewind the championship 10 months", https://www.planetf1.com/news/paul-di-resta-f1-cant-rewind-budget-cap/, As Formula 1 awaits the FIA’s report into last season’s teams’ spending, Paul di Resta does not believe taking the World title away from Red Bull, if they are guilty, is the “right thing to do”. Operating under a $145million budget cap, Red Bull won last year’s Drivers’ Championship with Max Verstappen securing the title on the final lap of the season. It was a championship in which momentum swung between Red Bull and Mercedes, the two going wheel-to-wheel while having to balance updating the car versus keeping to the cap. That means if Red Bull are guilty, Verstappen could be stripped of the 2021 World title. “You can’t go backwards but something has to be done.”Read more: What happens if an F1 team is found to be in breach of the FIA budget cap?, As Formula 1 awaits the FIA’s report into last season’s teams’ spending, Paul di Resta does not believe taking the World title away from Red Bull, if they are guilty, is the “right thing to do”. Operating under a $145million budget cap, Red Bull won last year’s Drivers’ Championship with Max Verstappen securing the title on the final lap of the season. It was a championship in which momentum swung between Red Bull and Mercedes, the two going wheel-to-wheel while having to balance updating the car versus keeping to the cap. Amidst rumours Red Bull may have overspent, anything from $1m to $10m, Hamilton has questioned their “four” late-season upgrades and says if Mercedes had done the same “it would have changed the outcome of the championship”. Under F1’s budget cap rules, one of the punishments for a material overspend – which is anything above 5% of the cap – could see the guilty team lose Drivers’ or Constructors’ Championship points. That means if Red Bull are guilty, Verstappen could be stripped of the 2021 World title. Di Resta does not believe that would be the “right” course of action. “A lot of tales in the paddock that Red Bull and Aston Martin may be in breach,” he told Sky F1 on Friday morning in Suzuka. “Is this good for Formula 1? No. Can you rewind the championship 10 months? I don’t believe that’s the right thing to do. “You’ve got to move forward. You’ve got to have a hard and fast rule.” The former F1 driver, like many in the paddock, is perplexed by the delay in releasing their findings with the teams having submitted all their information to the FIA at the end of March already. The report had been set to be released on Wednesday only for the FIA to then delay it until Monday. Charles Leclerc and George Russell both believe any team which has gone over the budget should be punished.#F1  — PlanetF1 (@Planet_F1) October 6, 2022 “Why in this day and age can we not get to the answer quicker that we all need?” Di Resta continued. “If it’s going to be a fine or money, well they’ve got a surplus of money because of how well Formula 1 is doing at the moment, so then you go back to ‘are we going to rewind the World Championship result?'” His fellow pundit Johnny Herbert agrees Formula 1 cannot go backwards in what is an “uncomfortable” situation for the sport. “It’s a big test because it’s something we find uncomfortable, I’m sure the fans back home find it equally,” he said. “So we’ve got to have a situation where F1 doesn’t damage itself in a way that everybody goes ‘what a crazy formula’. “I think the FIA, if someone has been found to have done the wrong thing and spent too much money, they have to come down hard on them. “How they come down hard on them I don’t know, maybe that’s got to be the Constructors’ Championship points somehow. “You can’t go backwards but something has to be done.” Read more: What happens if an F1 team is found to be in breach of the FIA budget cap?

2022 Formula 1: How to watch stream preview TV info for the Japanese Grand Prix, https://www.cbssports.com/motor-sports/news/2022-formula-1-how-to-watch-stream-preview-tv-info-for-the-japanese-grand-prix/, Formula 1 returns to Suzuka International Racing Course for the Japanese Grand Prix, a circuit that has seen 11 drivers crowned champion since it came onto the calendar in 1987. This is Formula 1's first time back in Japan since 2019, as it missed the previous two years because of the COVID-19 pandemic. As reported by Racer.com, accusations have floated that Verstappen's team, Red Bull Racing, along with Aston Martin, both exceeded the 2021 budget limits. Formula 1 was originally going to release its findings on the matter on Wednesday, but that has now been pushed back to Monday, a day after the Japanese Grand Prix. How to watch the Formula 1 Japanese Grand PrixDate: Sunday, Oct. 9Sunday, Oct. 9 Location: 3.608-mile (5.807 kilometer), 18-turn Suzuka International Racing Course3.608-mile (5.807 kilometer), 18-turn Suzuka International Racing Course Time: 1 a.m., Formula 1 returns to Suzuka International Racing Course for the Japanese Grand Prix, a circuit that has seen 11 drivers crowned champion since it came onto the calendar in 1987. This is Formula 1's first time back in Japan since 2019, as it missed the previous two years because of the COVID-19 pandemic. As it is where he took his first turns in an F1 car, Suzuka holds a special place in Max Verstappen's heart, and to claim his second Formula 1 title all he needs to do is leave Japan with a lead of 112 points or more over Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. Or will it be his first title? As reported by Racer.com, accusations have floated that Verstappen's team, Red Bull Racing, along with Aston Martin, both exceeded the 2021 budget limits. Formula 1 was originally going to release its findings on the matter on Wednesday, but that has now been pushed back to Monday, a day after the Japanese Grand Prix. Any excess that is less than five percent of the budget cap is considered a minor breach that teams can then work out with F1 through an "Accepted Breach Agreement." Anything over five percent would be considered egregious, and the parties involved would have to appear before the Cap Adjudication Panel. Penalties range from being reprimanded to having Drivers' and Constructors' points deducted and even exclusion. Through all the speculation, Red Bull Racing team principal Christian Horner insists they have not exceeded the 2021 budget cap, but with the ruling now pushed back to Monday, there will certainly be whispers following Verstappen, Horner and the rest of the Red Bull team throughout the weekend. So, along with all the regular distractions and noise, Verstappen must also find a way to simply keep his focus on winning the title on Sunday, which he states will take an effort where everything must go just right, regardless if it will be his second … or his first. "We need a perfect weekend, that's for sure," Verstappen told F1.com. "It would be very nice if it happens here, but if it doesn't happen here, I will be even more in favor the next race. It doesn't really change anything. You want to have a good weekend and try to maximize everything you can, and of course I need a perfect weekend to be able to clinch the title here but, to be honest, I'm not really thinking about it too much." How to watch the Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix Date: Sunday, Oct. 9 Sunday, Oct. 9 Location: 3.608-mile (5.807 kilometer), 18-turn Suzuka International Racing Course 3.608-mile (5.807 kilometer), 18-turn Suzuka International Racing Course Time: 1 a.m. ET 1 a.m. ET TV: ESPN2 ESPN2 Stream: fuboTV (try for free) What to expect Storied Suzuka is a challenging track noted for not one, not two but several turns that are considered classics. There's the downhill first corner and the ending chicane before the front straight, both locations made famous by Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost crashing each other out as teammates on consecutive seasons. There's the Spoon. Degner. The off-camber, sweeping double-apex 130R. Dunlop. Any track would be amazing with one or two of those, but Suzuka has them all. Legendary. Like many circuits, Suzuka is a track that punishes you for taking something for granted. Focus will be a premium over its 53 laps. Depending on the tire compounds Pirelli shows up with, there is the temptation to try a one-stop strategy, but with Suzuka's high speeds and high-g loads, tire degradation will likely make two stops the way to go. Add into the weather — some rain is expected, and temperatures should be fairly comfortable, if not cool, at 70 degrees Fahrenheit — and you have typical Suzuka. Anything can happen over 53 laps.
Cashgate: F1 boss' warning indicates Max Verstappen will lose championship, https://formula1news.co.uk/cashgate-f1-boss-warning-indicates-max-verstappen-will-lose-championship/, Formula 1 managing director, Ross Brawn, warned in 2019 that the financial regulations set to be imposed in 2021 were serious, and anyone breaking would lose their championship. In 2019, however, the FIA world motorsport council ratified an official spending cap that prohibited teams from spending more than $175 million. “Financial regulations are the dramatic change in F1,” he said at a press conference in Austin three years ago. “So the sanctions for breaching financial regulations will be sporting penalties of some sort, depending on the severity of the breach. If you fraudulently breach the financial regulations, you will be losing your championship., Formula 1 managing director, Ross Brawn, warned in 2019 that the financial regulations set to be imposed in 2021 were serious, and anyone breaking would lose their championship. F1 had previously tried to impose financial restrictions of sorts, but there was no signed agreement that no one could spend more than a certain amount of money. This meant that teams could continue spending as much as they wanted with no repercussions, and any prior arrangement was redundant. In 2019, however, the FIA world motorsport council ratified an official spending cap that prohibited teams from spending more than $175 million. READ: F1 boss: ‘Max is without doubt the benchmark’ This was lowered to $145 million due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and all teams had to stay within those boundaries. They were also required to document their spending for the FIA to review, so that they could ensure that there was no financial trickery getting past them. Last week, Red Bull and Aston Martin were mentioned in a report that suggested that two teams had overspent last year. There were even implications that the Austrian side had been in material breach of the rules by spending $155 million, but more recent indications are that they have not exceeded the limit by more than five percent. Article continues below The FIA have delayed their final decision on which teams are to receive a certificate of compliance until next week, as they still need to correlate all the information, or decide on penalties for breaches. After the budget cap was ratified in 2019, Brawn was adamant that there would be harsh punishments for “fraudulently” contravening the rules. “Financial regulations are the dramatic change in F1,” he said at a press conference in Austin three years ago. “We’ve tried for these in the past, and we’ve not been successful, I think the crucial thing about the financial regulations now is that they are part of the FIA regulations. “So the sanctions for breaching financial regulations will be sporting penalties of some sort, depending on the severity of the breach. “Whereas before we had the resource restriction, which was a gentlemen’s agreement between teams – well there’s not many gentlemen in the paddock I’m afraid, and that was a failure. “But this has teeth. If you fraudulently breach the financial regulations, you will be losing your championship. So it has serious consequences if teams breach these regulations.” The Briton also affirmed that the FIA have the personnel to enforce the spending limit. “We’ve got a very strong team of financial experts within the FIA and within F1, and we’ve sought outside support on this,” explained Brawn. “Deloitte are one of the experts on sports finances, they’ve been very involved with the football world, and you can see the positive effect that’s starting to have. “They’ve been pretty well thought out, but they will need development, like any regulation.

Budgets have been escalating. F1 is almost a victim of its own success in that the rewards of success are so valuable that the justification for investment keeps coming.” Both Red Bull and Aston Martin have denied breaching the budget restrictions last year.

Hamilton's run of four successive titles came to an end last year when Red Bull rival Max Verstappen denied him an unprecedented eighth championship on the last lap of a controversial season finale. The 37-year-old hasn't been in the hunt this year and is still searching for his first win to add to his record 103-victory career haul, with Mercedes having been caught out by the rule changes introduced this season. Hamilton, a vocal advocate of environmental causes, human rights, social justice, equality and diversity said his main motivation behind continuing would remain fighting for wins and championships. But he also wanted to carry on so he could continue to make the sport more inclusive. "There's a lot of work that still needs to be done in this sport," said Hamilton. "I can't retire now because I'm only just embarking in helping shift and create a more open and inclusive environment here in this sport and I've got to stay to help that continue."
New Red Bull deal makes Honda's F1 'exit' even more confusing, https://the-race.com/formula-1/new-red-bull-deal-makes-hondas-f1-exit-even-more-confusing/, Honda agreeing a deal to strengthen its ties to the two Red Bull Formula 1 teams fewer than 12 months since it technically quit the championship makes for an extremely confusing look.

Video: The unraced Honda F1 car Verstappen has reunited with Read moreIn October 2020 it announced it would quit F1. Red Bull is footing the bill in some way, at least more than it did previously. The second thing Honda must regret is the continuation deal it did with Red Bull, whereby Honda gave up everything for no reward and even let the engine be renamed after Red Bull Powertrains., Honda agreeing a deal to strengthen its ties to the two Red Bull Formula 1 teams fewer than 12 months since it technically quit the championship makes for an extremely confusing look. Since officially leaving F1 at the end of 2021, Honda has effectively been a contractor for Red Bull. Its only recognition this year in what is set to be a double Red Bull championship triumph is a small HRC sticker at the back of the engine cover, while the engines (which Honda designed, developed, assembles and maintains) run under another company’s name. At least from the Japanese Grand Prix, Honda will get a bit more credit. From the Suzuka weekend Red Bull and AlphaTauri will run with a Honda Racing Corporation logo on the nosecone instead of the engine cover. This is to make room for the return of the classic Honda logo bearing the name itself, which hasn’t been seen on an F1 car since the 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. It is effectively a fast-tracked version of the revised branding deal we were expecting to happen for 2023. It will run until the end of 2025, and gives Honda a touch more prominence again. It may also come to serve as a soft ‘re-entry’ to F1 ahead of a brand new project for 2026. Which all adds up to a baffling look for Honda. Video: The unraced Honda F1 car Verstappen has reunited with Read more In October 2020 it announced it would quit F1. In December 2021 it officially left. Now, in October 2022, it’s done a deal to put its stickers back on the cars using its engine. Nobody’s really noticed Honda’s absence since the end of the 2021 season because as far as most people are concerned, Honda’s not really left. It has stepped back, that much is certain. It might not be that obvious on the outside but the number of ‘Honda people’ in the paddock is vastly reduced, the corporate hospitality is gone, and only the core embedded personnel within the teams on the engineering side remain. There will also be a different kind of commercial arrangement underpinning the investment required to build and maintain the engines. Red Bull is footing the bill in some way, at least more than it did previously. But however Honda might want to justify its decision to walk away, and insist it has left F1, the decision made in 2020 looks more short-sighted and foolish by the minute. The result is Honda slowly undoing its own exit strategy over the last 18 months or so. A change in CEO in April 2021 – Takahiro Hachigo out, Toshihiro Mibe in – might have something to do with Honda’s subsequent actions going directly against the decision that was announced in late-2020: from the generous continuation project to the new branding deal announced this week to the discussions over a new 2026 engine partnership with Red Bull entirely. Post-Hachigo Honda seems to regret two things. First, the decision to walk away in the first place. Because it now looks like an increasingly rash move that was done to create an image of slashing costs and insist the company was focused on a future fuelled by sustainable technologies. The second thing Honda must regret is the continuation deal it did with Red Bull, whereby Honda gave up everything for no reward and even let the engine be renamed after Red Bull Powertrains. If it didn’t, why bother with putting not just an extra sticker on the car – but one with the actual Honda name? The full story of how M c Laren steered Honda towards failure Read more Chaotically amusing as it looks when the timeline is laid out in full, the U-turn we seem to be witnessing in slow-motion is not a particularly surprising development. Honda’s racing division never wanted to leave. The massive development effort that went into the 2021 engine once the racing division knew what was coming ensured Honda went out in a blaze of glory. And F1 is in the midst of a great boom. Yet Honda was forced to walk away as planned to honour a decision made in haste, early in the COVID-19 pandemic, by a different CEO. In doing so, Honda threw away a chance to cement this as its new greatest era in F1. Honda re-entered F1 in 2015 to recreate the 1988-1991 McLaren glory years. OK, the plan failed with McLaren, but had Honda shown anything like the patience and commitment of F1’s other manufacturers, it would have won multiple titles with Red Bull. Instead it’s been reduced to an invisible partner, a status that clearly Honda realised is simply illogical to maintain. Honda’s lack of long-term planning and capricious leadership have always been its great vulnerabilities. It has arguably set the standard for F1 manufacturer volatility. And this saga – quitting but never quite leaving, then starting anew – is its most confusing of all.
Verstappen on the verge of history as Formula 1 returns to Suzuka, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.verstappen-on-the-verge-of-history-as-formula-1-returns-to-suzuka.RlY4SExvaV8aa6k98LeYW.html, FORM GUIDE: Will Verstappen clinch the title as F1 returns to Suzuka for the first time since 2019? As the calendar has expanded, Suzuka has seen fewer title deciders in recent years. The last time was 2011, when Sebastian Vettel – then driving for Red Bull – too his second championship. WATCH: Relive the 2019 Japanese Grand Prix as brilliant Bottas wins over battling Vettel and Hamilton Are we about to see another Red Bull driver secure his second title at Suzuka? They lined the streets outside the circuit and around the main gate, hoping to catch a glimpse of their heroes., Formula 1 returns to the Land of the Rising Sun for the first time since 2019 with Suzuka playing host to the Japanese Grand Prix, and you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone in the paddock who isn’t excited to be back at the historic figure-of-eight circuit. The Honda-owned venue has been a near permanent feature on the calendar since 1987 with 11 drivers’ championships having been sealed on the hallowed asphalt. FORM GUIDE: Will Verstappen clinch the title as F1 returns to Suzuka for the first time since 2019? Its corners are instantly recognisable landmarks of our motorsport – and have decided titles for 35 years. The sweeping uphill esses are very fast and demand precision, bravery and commitment. They caught out Nigel Mansell in practice at Suzuka’s first F1 event in 1987, the Briton suffering an injury that ruled him out of the race weekend and handed his Williams team mate Nelson Piquet a third title. Gerhard Berger won the first Japanese World Championship Grand Prix to be held at Suzuka, in 1987 The chicane at the end of the lap has been the location of many successful overtakes – but also numerous failed attempts, none more famous than 1989, when Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna collided. Senna was disqualified – and Prost won the title. And then there’s the fast, downhill first corner, scene – of course – of the infamous collision when a year later Senna and Prost got too close for comfort once more. This time, it was Senna who secured the title. And I haven’t even talked about Spoon, the epic Degners and 130R. There is not a bad corner on the Suzuka circuit. Not many tracks around the world can make that claim. READ MORE: 'We need a perfect weekend' – Verstappen weighs up title chances on return to Suzuka An iconic image as Senna and Prost collide in the 1989 Japanese GP There has been many a happy memory made around Suzuka, Michael Schumacher ending Ferrari’s 21-year wait for a title when he triumphed at Suzuka in 2000. Four years earlier, it was Damon Hill who mastered Suzuka, claiming an emotional maiden championship. Mika Hakkinen won both his titles at the venue, too. As the calendar has expanded, Suzuka has seen fewer title deciders in recent years. The last time was 2011, when Sebastian Vettel – then driving for Red Bull – too his second championship. WATCH: Relive the 2019 Japanese Grand Prix as brilliant Bottas wins over battling Vettel and Hamilton Are we about to see another Red Bull driver secure his second title at Suzuka? Max Verstappen is the overwhelming favourite to get over the line this weekend, the Dutchman in control of his own destiny knowing a win plus fastest lap will earn him the crown no matter where his rivals finish. Achieving the feat here would resonate with Verstappen, as it was the location where he drove an F1 car for the first time when he drove for Toro Rosso in FP1 back in 2014. Max Verstappen looking forward to potential title win in front of 'incredibly passionate' Japanese fans It's also a home Grand Prix for Honda – who have a support deal with Red Bull Power Trains and this week announced they are ramping up their partnership with Red Bull and AlphaTauri, which includes the return of the Honda logo on the cars of both teams. TREMAYNE: After his brilliant Singapore win, Perez has a clear new target for the rest of the season Winning the title at Honda’s track would be a nice touch for the engine manufacturer who invested so much in hybrid technology when they re-entered Formula 1 with McLaren before switching to the Red Bull family, but officially left at the end of last season. The Red Bulls are expected to be very fast around the sweeping turns of Suzuka, marking Verstappen out as favourite for the win – with his team mate Sergio Perez, winner last time out in Singapore, likely to fancy his chances too. Perez enters fresh from victory in Singapore There'll be plenty of eyes on home favourite Yuki Tsunoda, too, the Japanese driver finally getting the chance to race F1 on home soil after last year's event didn't take place because of Covid-19. The 22-year-old recently agreed a new deal to stay at AlphaTauri for 2023 – in what will be his third season – and will be hugely popular this weekend with his face plastered all over the venue. The circuit was buzzing with fans, who are renowned as some of the most passionate in the world. They lined the streets outside the circuit and around the main gate, hoping to catch a glimpse of their heroes.

Lewis Hamilton: Mercedes driver says it's 'imperative' budget cap punishments given, https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/63156066, Hamilton said: "I like to think that if it's being delayed, it's because it's being taken very seriously. Hamilton's Mercedes team and Ferrari both said at last weekend's Singapore Grand Prix that it was an open secret that two teams broke the cost cap last season. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has insisted that he is "absolutely confident" in Red Bull's submission to the FIA, adding: "We believe we are comfortably within the cap." The seven-time champion said: "It is imperative, for transparency, [that punishments are handed out]. "I have my foundation that I have just started and it's going to take a lot of work., The most recent delay is the fourth time the FIA has given teams a publication date only to push it back Lewis Hamilton says it is "imperative" that suitable punishments are meted out for any team found to have broken Formula 1's budget cap. The FIA will reveal on Monday which teams exceeded it last season, after delaying the publication. Hamilton said: "I like to think that if it's being delayed, it's because it's being taken very seriously. "It would be bad for the sport if action wasn't taken if there was a breach." Hamilton's Mercedes team and Ferrari both said at last weekend's Singapore Grand Prix that it was an open secret that two teams broke the cost cap last season. And it is widely expected within the sport that Red Bull and Aston Martin will be found not to have been in compliance in 2021 when the results are published. Senior sources have told BBC Sport that if any team is found to have been in breach last year, the offence is likely to be minor. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has insisted that he is "absolutely confident" in Red Bull's submission to the FIA, adding: "We believe we are comfortably within the cap." Hamilton, who was engaged in a close battle with Red Bull's Max Verstappen in the championship last year, said he had "trust" in FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem to "do what is right for the sport". The seven-time champion said: "It is imperative, for transparency, [that punishments are handed out]. "We need to continue to have transparency for the fans and the integrity of the sport. I know there are a lot of conversations in the background. No one truly knows. There are different numbers and things being said here and there." He said that if a team is found to be in breach "it would put in question our values and transparency [as a sport]". He added: "As a driver you are always asking for updates. In Silverstone, we got our last update and that was [worth] almost 0.3secs. And I am pretty certain it cost less than a million. Maybe in time [working hours] it cost more. "I remember after that needing more updates but seeing trucks of updates continuing to arrive on the other car [Red Bull], and I was thinking it is going to be difficult to beat them in the championship if they keep bringing updates. "It is so integral to the development race. If we had had another half a million to spend, we would have been in a different position at some of the following races, if we had bought another floor, which we could easily have done. "But that's not the name of the game and I'm grateful our team is very strict and abides by it. It needs to be taken seriously." A new contract will come Hamilton's Mercedes contract runs out at the end of the 2023 season and on Thursday ahead of the Japanese Grand Prix he gave the strongest indication yet that he will sign a new deal to stay in F1 beyond then. "I know what I want to do," Hamilton said. "I plan on staying longer. It is not set in stone how long. I plan to be with Mercedes the rest of my life. It's more figuring out what we're going to do, what are the timelines, even beyond racing. "I want to be building with Mercedes. It's not just a car manufacturer. It has such a powerful platform. It has places it can really have a positive impact - on the environment, there are loads of things we can do together. "I want to be part of that process beyond winning championships - but for now we want to win championships so that's the immediate focus." Verstappen, who beat Hamilton last year in a controversial finale in which the race director failed to follow the rules correctly in a late safety-car period, is poised to win his second title this season and could do so as early as Sunday. But Hamilton said the possibility of the Dutchman starting a period of domination, and trying to prevent that happening, was not his motivating factor. He said championing diversity in motorsport was one of the key reasons for wanting to race on. "It's more just where I am in life," he said. "I have great things happening outside the sport. I am building things outside. "I have my foundation that I have just started and it's going to take a lot of work. I can't retire now because I am only just embarking on helping shift and creating a more open and inclusive environment in the sport and I've got to stay to help that continue. "Also, I am feeling healthier than I have ever been, in terms of what I eat and how I prepare myself and I love racing. "I have been doing it since I was five years old and that's not going to go away and if I am still fit and able to be focused, why would I stop?"
Formula 1's Crypto.com Sponsor Is Falling Apart, https://jalopnik.com/formula-1s-crypto-com-sponsor-is-falling-apart-1849626650, If you’ve watched a Formula 1 race this year, there’ s a good chance you have — if only unconsciously — seen plenty of Crypto.com ads. A new report from Ad Age’s Asa Hiken describes a company that has marketed itself into a downward spiral. If you’ve watched any sporting events in the recent past, you’ve probably either seen a commercial or an eventside ad for Crypto.com, a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Crypto.com has dissolved deals with Angel City F.C., Twitch Rivals, and the UEFA Champions League. Formula 1 likely won't fall apart thanks to Crypto.com — but it's yet another fascinating chapter in the sport's long history of accepting sponsorship deals that aren't quite cut out to meet their promises., If you’ve watched a Formula 1 race this year, there’ s a good chance you have — if only unconsciously — seen plenty of Crypto.com ads. Along with companies like Aramco, DHL, Emirates, and Heineken, Crypto.com has looked like it’s become one of the key players in financing the future of global open-wheel motorsport. But right now, all that money might be drying up. A new report from Ad Age’s Asa Hiken describes a company that has marketed itself into a downward spiral. If you’ve watched any sporting events in the recent past, you’ve probably either seen a commercial or an eventside ad for Crypto.com, a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Now, it looks like thousands of employees are being let go as the “crypto winter” descends. Just after Crypto.com announced that it had hit the 50-million user mark — and just after it had served as a primary sponsor for F1's Miami Grand Prix — the crypto market crashed. Advertisement From Ad Age: In the months that followed, Crypto.com quietly downsized many of the partnership deals intended to garner mainstream attention for the brand, and in some cases the firm has attempted to pull out from these deals altogether, according to details shared by former and current employees at the company who spoke with Ad Age on the condition of anonymity. The exchange also saw a reduction in its headcount of previously unreported scale, with 30% to 40% of its pre-summer workforce departing the company from June through August—the vast majority of which were due to layoffs, according to former and current employees. A lack of internal directories prevented Ad Age from confirming exact numbers, as well as differentiating between layoffs and natural attrition, but multiple sources independently stated that just over 2,000 employees have left the company since layoffs began. Crypto.com was previously reported to have let go of just over 1,000 employees at most. Marketing personnel were some of the first to be targeted by the layoffs, including an entire in-house creative team that was eliminated mere months after its creation, sources said.

It worked well at getting Crypto.com’s name out. But a downturn in crypto interest saw the platform tumble. Crypto.com has dissolved deals with Angel City F.C., Twitch Rivals, and the UEFA Champions League. It has maintained several other deals with sports teams or events but has in some cases reduced the number of hospitality packages available. Advertisement Right now, the future of Crypto.com and cryptocurrency as a whole is a little unclear. It obviously hasn’t become a universally adopted form of currency, and the initial allure seems to have faded. It could keep tumbling, or it could see a new rise in interest. Formula 1 likely won't fall apart thanks to Crypto.com — but it's yet another fascinating chapter in the sport's long history of accepting sponsorship deals that aren't quite cut out to meet their promises.

He’s been linked to Alpine and Haas, even Williams has been thrown into the mix, although at the moment the speculation has turned to Mercedes. Not for a race seat mind you, the team already has its 2023 line up confirmed, but a reserve driver role. According to French broadcaster Canal+, Ricciardo and Mercedes are in “advanced talks” over a reserve driver deal for next season, the driver meeting with Toto Wolff in Mercedes’ motorhome in Singapore. But whether that was contract negotiation time or just a hello, the eight-time grand prix winner isn’t giving anything away. “Keen on resolving it?” he said in the Japanese GP press conference when asked about his future. “I wouldn’t say there is a problem. “I am just taking time to figure out what will be the best thing for me. “There is no rush. I feel no pressure to quickly sign something. “I want to take the right amount of time. I won’t just sign the first contract to be back on the grid. “I’ll keep going with the season and it will become clear what is best for me.” Max Verstappen, Daniel Ricciardo and George Russell “press conference” #JapaneseGP #F1 pic.twitter.com/QQdhZJ2V2r — F1 To Rule Them All (@F1RulesMedia) October 6, 2022 Haas team boss Guenther Steiner was recently asked about Ricciardo and whether he’s a factor in Haas’ driver decision with the team looking at alternatives to Mick Schumacher. The Italian said it was up to Ricciardo to pick up the phone once he’s decided what it is he wants with his tomorrow. “He needs to weigh up what he wants to do,” he told Sky F1. “If he decides to join a team at the back of the grid, that doesn’t mean he cannot move on up the grid. “He needs to find out what he wants to do in life, and that will take him time because this is a big decision for his career and I’m sure he takes it very carefully what he wants to do.” But in the wake of his best result of this season, a P5 at the Singapore Grand Prix, Ricciardo insists he has nothing new to tell anyone. “There’s nothing you don’t know! Full transparency,” he added. “Good results help, they make everything better. “This isn’t a question of whether I still want to do it. I do. “The result felt good but doesn’t change my course [for next season]. That’s why I want to be at the front.” Read more: F1 2023 driver line up: Who’s confirmed for next year’s grid
