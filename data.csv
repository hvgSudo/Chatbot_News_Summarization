Formula 1 | Russell: Our lifestyle is 'not healthy' in Formula 1 - US Sports, https://lookcharms.com/formula-1-russell-our-lifestyle-is-not-healthy-in-formula-1/, On becoming a Mercedes F1 driver George Russell moved to the front of the grid and has been steadily battling for a podium spot since this year. The Briton thus evokes a lifestyle that is not  not healthy not only for the drivers but also for the entire Formula 1 paddock forced to live at a hellish pace.  We visit 22 countries in one year we stay in 22 different hotels we eat 22 different kinds of food and we experience ten different time zones. For Russell another difficult aspect of his job as an F1 driver is having to systematically satisfy public opinion he who insists on reminding us that he is not a robot. Riding is easy because its my job Im happy as soon as I put my helmet on., On becoming a Mercedes F1 driver George Russell moved to the front of the grid and has been steadily battling for a podium spot since this year. But to shine in the top category of motorsport is not easy with great pressure on the shoulders and it is being constantly or almost on the move around the world. The Briton thus evokes a lifestyle that is not  not healthy not only for the drivers but also for the entire Formula 1 paddock forced to live at a hellish pace. I am driven and motivated by performing winning races and becoming world champion. But this sport is exhausting Russell said.  There is the physical aspect but also the psychological one. You experience so many emotions during a race weekend the successes the ups the downs. Traveling is also demanding on the body. It is not a style healthy lifestyle. And Im not just talking about the drivers but everyone in this sport.   We visit 22 countries in one year we stay in 22 different hotels we eat 22 different kinds of food and we experience ten different time zones. This lack of routine is not good for anyone. Today I would say to you that I can go on until Im 40 but maybe Ill say something very different in five years.  For Russell another difficult aspect of his job as an F1 driver is having to systematically satisfy public opinion he who insists on reminding us that he is not a robot.  So much is expected of athletes these days and I think people sometimes forget that we are human beings. I am a racing driver not an activist or a politician. You are expected to have the right opinion about everything and for me at 24 thats probably the hardest part of the job. Riding is easy because its my job Im happy as soon as I put my helmet on.  Russell also has a thought for the drivers who will leave the paddock at the end of the season whether by choice or lack of opportunity.  Sebastian Vettel is retiring and one of the biggest names in the history of our sport is leaving while Daniel Ricciardo will probably not be driving next year. I have a huge respect for them and they will obviously be greatly missed by the sport but like any industry F1 will run its course. Thats the reality.

Video: F1 pit-stops under two seconds are allowed (and THIS is why), https://racingnews365.com/video-f1-pit-stops-under-two-seconds-are-allowed-and-this-is-why, A change in Formula 1 regulations this year has seen the sport move from 13inch wheels to 18inch ones. This has made the tyres heavier and thus more difficult for mechanics to change all four of them quickly and safely during pitstops. A rule change halfway through 2021 changed the pitstop procedure making it even more difficult for mechanics to complete a lightning fast stop. However at the Mexico City Grand Prix McLaren became the first team to complete a subtwo second pitstop since the introduction of the new regulations changing all four tyres on Daniel Ricciardos car in 1.98 seconds.

The German believes the organisation is waiting too long to take steps and therefore hopes for change in the future he told Der Spiegel. Article continues under ad The motorsport class is revamping the engine regulations in the 2026 season. These new rules should ensure that Formula 1 becomes more sustainable and therefore moves with the times. Although Vettel supports the plans he actually thinks it is too little and too late. I think 2026 is too late to see it as pioneering. Synthetic fuels already exist so why wait another four years he argues. Formula 1 is far too busy with the now and looks far too little at the possibilities of the future. It is busy expanding instead of being a pacesetter for tomorrows mobility with foresight. Vettel critical of the organisation Therefore in the interview Vettel decides to give Formula 1 a slap on the wrist. The veteran driver who is retiring from the sport after this season finds it unjustifiable that it takes several years to address the problems. I find it a bit embarrassing. E10 has been available at the petrol station for more than a decade. I see synthetic fuels more as a bridging technology because producing them requires a lot of renewable energy. This energy can be better used for heating and hot water.

The shortened race  which takes place on a Saturday and decides the grid for Sundays main event  has been held over three weekends in both 2021 and 2022 with that number set to increase to six in 2023. Brazils Sprint will be the final one of the current season but the event is not one that Verstappen looks forward to. I dont like it Verstappen told media including RacingNews365.com when asked for his thoughts on the increased amount of Sprint races in 2023. For me the weekend format isnt one that I enjoy. I dont mind the one practice and going straight into qualifying  I think it probably is even better for me. But theres no feeling in the Sprint races. All the time when I do these races its all about Lets not have damage make sure that you stay in the top three. And for me thats not really a race because then you go into the main race. There are way more points available there anyway and you just risk anyway a bit more there. You do another start probably thats a bit of excitement. Its only people who are really out of position that will move forward because normally you put the tyre on which just lasts the whole Sprint anyway go the race distance and not much happens.

Before Ive ever spoken to anyone else my talks have always been with McLaren first said Norris. Its always how it goes. The best thing for me is signing the contract that I have now just having that confidence and knowledge that youre going to be in Formula 1 for whatever three four or five years. For me thats like the best feeling. It makes you more relaxed more comfortable in the environment youre in. So thats the best of all of it.
Lewis Hamilton calls on the FIA to protect 'integrity' in Formula 1: 'It's not enough at all' | Formula 1, https://www.aviationanalysis.net/lewis-hamilton-calls-on-the-fia-to-protect-integrity-in-formula-1-its-not-enough-at-all-formula-1/, The FIA confirmed last week that Red Bull spent more money last year building and developing the car than was allowed. This is probably less than 5 percent and if the expenses are exceeded the association can impose a fine. Although the penalty kick has not yet been decided Red Bulls rivals are already ahead of the curve. For example McLaren boss Zak Brown has already made his voice heard as Lewis Hamilton said yesterday in Austin that Max Verstappens formation should be punished.

Since his debut with BMW Sauber in 2007 the German has been a member of the F1 paddock. In 2010 he would go on to become the F1 world champion at the age of 19. As time went on Vettel won four straight championships to become the youngest twotime threetime and fourtime world champion.

I participate in a physical activity that you could continue to participate in after a twoyear layoff. After leaving Formula One Sebastian Vettel feels like going into rehab He went on However Im hoping that in two years Ill be able to say No thanks Im done with racing. Im not sure whether I really want to watch the races after retirement. For 16 years my lifes work was Formula 1. Now I secretly anticipate being able to live without Formula 1  almost like Im entering rehab. You may get emotionally connected to something if you enjoy it.

I still know a few individuals that work at Red Bull so Im thrilled for them. He went on They clearly have a lot of momentum from the previous year and the vehicle this year is amazing. Although they were heavier than anybody else they still won races and I believe they have finally lost weight. The automobile is so present but Max is also doing superbly. There are currently only two races left in Vettels career. What lies in store for him moving forward will be intriguing.

IndyCar's F1-testing duo see a superlicence 'blockage', https://the-race.com/formula-1/indycars-f1-testing-duo-see-a-superlicence-blockage/, The two latest IndyCar drivers to appear in Formula 1 sessions both admit they have qualms about the FIA superlicence system. Asked if IndyCar should be represented better Palou said Yeah but I dont think thats going to change at all. OWard has been outspoken on the superlicence situation before and labelled IndyCar underrated in a recent interview with The Race. Because I feel like theres a lot of opportunities that have been wasted because of having a blockage of superlicence. When confirming that Herta did not qualify for a superlicence this year it reiterated it continuously reviews regulations and procedures including with respect to superlicence eligibility., The two latest IndyCar drivers to appear in Formula 1 sessions both admit they have qualms about the FIA superlicence system. Alex Palou drove for McLaren in FP1 at the United States Grand Prix last month and already has a superlicence supplemented by his 2021 IndyCar title. M c Laren stars new attitude towards his F1 dream Read more However Pato OWard  due to drive in Abu Dhabi FP1 also for McLaren  does not have a superlicence despite finishing fourth third and seventh in the last three IndyCar championships while winning four races  the same number as Palou  in the last two seasons. And with both drivers routes to IndyCar having been unusual in themselves  with both diverting via Super Formula in Japan OWard also a sportscar racer and very briefly a Red Bull junior and Palou struggling for budget in European singleseaters  OWard believes theyre also examples of how random the superlicence points situation can become for anyone deviating from the F1 support bill norm. The superlicence systems perceived shortcomings were highlighted by fellow IndyCar driver Colton Hertas plight earlier this year as he tried to gain dispensation to take up a seat AlphaTauri wanted to give him but a lack of intervention from the FIA meant Herta had to forego the seat now taken by Nyck de Vries. Currently the IndyCar champion gets 40 points  the same as for winning F2  but while F2 offers 40 points for second and third which is still enough for an F1 superlicence IndyCars points scale decreases dramatically. The American series gets 30 points for second 20 for third 10 for fourth and eight for fifth. OWard earned just four points for his seventhplace finish this year despite the competitiveness of the series and his season which was hampered by reliability issues despite a record that included qualifying in the top six on every road course and a seriesequalling best average starting position alongside his impressive win tally. The systems quirks have been exposed further this year as Linus Lundqvist  the Indy Lights champion who won the heavilyweighted Formula Regional Americas title in 2020  has qualified for a superlicence via racing on the junior ladder before he has even raced in IndyCar. Asked if IndyCar should be represented better Palou said Yeah but I dont think thats going to change at all. Obviously I have my superlicence. Im happy so I dont care what happens. But obviously I think its very unfair that theres some series that they dont get enough licence points  like Pato doesnt have and he finished third in the championship fourth in the championship and fifth or seventh. A guy that is like that doing 17 weekends racing against people that have 10 or 15 years of experience in IndyCar  that guy is capable of doing a lot in F1. But thats the rules. So hopefully they change it in the future. But I understand that also the FIA they want everybody to go through Europe and through other places. But its true that you could get more points by racing in I dont know a winter series in Thailand and winning that an Asian F3 title is 10 points than finishing fifth in IndyCar eight points. Thats a bit like I dont know if thats fair or not. OWards superlicence situation came back to haunt him in 2019 when Red Bull gambled on adding him to its junior programme  for which he gave up a Carlin IndyCar deal  due to its belief he had enough points for a superlicence. But with the number of competitors in some of the categories namely IMSA Prototype Challenge and Indy Lights that wouldve qualified him for points having been below the FIA requirement he was actually short of the required 40  and while Red Bull appeared willing to keep OWard on for another season he ultimately elected to take up McLarens offer to race for its newlyformed IndyCar team for 2020 where he immediately impressed. OWard has been outspoken on the superlicence situation before and labelled IndyCar underrated in a recent interview with The Race. I think as a driver and I think many others not just me in IndyCar have proven to be capable of being in Formula 1 deserve the shot to be Formula 1 and would be competitive in Formula 1 OWard said. And sadly IndyCar is very underrated. We all need to work as a community to fix that. Because I feel like theres a lot of opportunities that have been wasted because of having a blockage of superlicence. I think massive talents like Max Verstappen who is arguably the best driver on the grid right now he wouldnt have been able to come to Formula 1 if it was for the superlicence. And I think like Fernando Alonso wouldnt have either Kimi Raikkonen wouldnt have either. I get that they want to have something that qualifies you for it. But I really think that theres many qualified drivers that should have the shot and should have the chance to go into Formula 1 and and they dont because of that. I hope its something thats addressed. We all know how hard it is to win in IndyCar and how competitive it is. And anybody thats contending in IndyCar I believe deserves a shot in Formula 1. Or at least the chance right If a team decides to give it to them. OWard added that he thinks drivers who have unusual resumes such as his shouldnt be punished for sampling many championships when it comes to superlicence qualification. Not everyones career is going to be a perfect upbringing because not everybody has millions and millions to spend in order to get to Formula 1 he said. My career and many others have been insane. Japan Mexico prototypes America Europe its super diverse. But a lot of times when its diverse you dont complete championships certain things just happen because you dont have the funding to continue or just stuff like that. And its just a shame because I feel like theres a lot of lost talents that deserve a shot if a team decides to give it to them. But then they cant because of something else in the way. The FIAs superlicence system has not been inflexible since its introduction with the governing body having made changes to championships point allocations. It even made allowances for the impact of the COVID19 pandemic on drivers careers. When confirming that Herta did not qualify for a superlicence this year it reiterated it continuously reviews regulations and procedures including with respect to superlicence eligibility.
Bottas keen to stick around with Sauber for Audi F1 arrival, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/bottas-keen-to-stick-around-for-audi-arrival-at-sauber-f1/10395754/, For current Alfa Romeo driver Bottas who joined the privateer after five years at Mercedes driving for a bona fide works team again is naturally an enticing prospect. When asked in Mexico if he is hoping to stick around at Sauber when Audi jumps on board in 2026 Bottas said Why not Valtteri Bottas Alfa Romeo F1 Team Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport ImagesWhile Bottas conceded Alfa Romeo needs a lot of work to become competitive he hopes extra Audi backing ahead of its official 2026 entry can help the team bridge the gap to the frontrunners. I think the timeline depends on how much Audi is going to support this team before they officially come as a manufacturer. Were still with Alfa Romeo., At Augusts Belgian Grand Prix Audi officially confirmed it would join forces with Sauber as its power unit manufacturer in 2026 when a new engine formula will kick in. After Alfa Romeos sponsorship deal with the Hinwil team lapses at the end of 2023 it is expected Audi will gradually start ramping up its involvement as it becomes a shareholder in the Swiss outfit. For current Alfa Romeo driver Bottas who joined the privateer after five years at Mercedes driving for a bona fide works team again is naturally an enticing prospect. When asked in Mexico if he is hoping to stick around at Sauber when Audi jumps on board in 2026 Bottas said Why not Im 33 years old so I hope that Im going to be there. Bottas explained that Audis entry will help keep both him and the team motivated in the coming years. I would say yes because if you look at the big picture I think its huge. Theres big potential for Sauber with Audi. No doubt they want to succeed in the future. They want to do well and show theyre serious. So I think for any driver on the grid especially for me now being already part of Sauber it would be very interesting to be part of that project. I definitely think its possible. Valtteri Bottas Alfa Romeo F1 Team Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images While Bottas conceded Alfa Romeo needs a lot of work to become competitive he hopes extra Audi backing ahead of its official 2026 entry can help the team bridge the gap to the frontrunners. Theres still work to do no doubt. Thats the fact. But its not that far you know the facilities are there the Finn pointed out. Some facilities some machinery can be better compared to a championshipwinning team. And the amount of people in the team is still a bit less than at least what I saw last year. But with the support of a manufacturer like Audi I see no reason why it wouldnt be possible. I think the timeline depends on how much Audi is going to support this team before they officially come as a manufacturer. Obviously nothing changes for next year. Were still with Alfa Romeo. And of course we hope that we can have a better car than this year. But then I think it depends on the support from 2024 onwards. If Audi are willing to support if theyre really helping a lot and supporting and if the power unit is good for 2026 which is impossible to predict at the moment then why not.

Formula 1 | Latifi received 'very positive' message from Hamilton after Abu Dhabi - US Sports, https://lookcharms.com/formula-1-latifi-received-very-positive-message-from-hamilton-after-abu-dhabi/, Nicholas Latifi spoke again about his accident in Abu Dhabi which triggered the Safety Car that cost Lewis Hamilton the world title. Its just the bad side of social media these days. There were maybe two days where I took social media off my phone and then slowly went back to it reinstalled the apps on my phone. I obviously have PR people who helped me with my social media and stuff and they have access to it. It doesnt really matter especially since in reality I didnt do anything wrong., Nicholas Latifi spoke again about his accident in Abu Dhabi which triggered the Safety Car that cost Lewis Hamilton the world title. The Williams F1 driver had tried to attack Mick Schumacher and is defending his aggressive approach when he had nothing to gain.  I was fighting with Mick for a position very far from the points  remembers Latifi.  I think thats one of the most important things I wanted all the fans to understand. In reality it doesnt matter if Im racing for P20 P19 the points or the podium.   Our car that day was just good enough to be in those positions. If I dont try to get every little thing Williams might as well not show up to the races. So obviously that would be a stupid attitude to have but thats just the public perception.  Subsequently he received death threats on social networks and deplores the magnitude of this affair for a simple sporting event  The aftermath hasnt been very pleasant. Its just the bad side of social media these days. I dont think it really has anything to do with sports.   It was obviously a very high profile incident because of the outcome of what happened. It wasnt just a race at the start of the year it was something at the end of the year with the battle for the championship. Tons of tension and emotions for the fans because it was a very exciting season.   Total support  which has done good for Latifi The Canadian remembers stepping away from social media and receiving support from another driver by doing the same. Indeed Hamilton wrote to him to support him in the face of the wave of hatred that was unleashed against him.  It was a very positive thing to do. Lewis messaged me to get in touch with me. He kind of broke away from the world of social media and everything. He obviously had his own emotions to deal with what he was fighting against.   But he sent me a very nice message of full support. I even received messages from other members of the Mercedes team as well as countless visible messages from different teams different drivers etc.  A voluntary withdrawal on social networks Although he hadnt done anything voluntarily Latifi still had to step back from the wave of hatred he faced in public. He reveals that it was his family and the people managing his communication that helped him overcome this. There were maybe two days where I took social media off my phone and then slowly went back to it reinstalled the apps on my phone. I obviously have PR people who helped me with my social media and stuff and they have access to it.   They said they were trying to clean up as much as they could like everyone else would have in this situation. So I heard a lot from them and obviously from my family members who were still on social media after the fact and noticed how bad it was.   I saw again when I went back all the online hateful abuse and stuff. And I think its clear that its never right. Its just the ugly side of the networks nowadays. It doesnt really matter especially since in reality I didnt do anything wrong. If I had done it on purpose that was another story. But I was doing just my own race.  Jost Capito his boss had explained that this had taken a blow to Latifis confidence which the main interested party does not deny  I got over it pretty quickly and the fact that the winter holidays followed immediately may have helped me.   Other aspects of this year have had an effect on my confidence. I had a few other incidents at the start of the year which doesnt help when youre trying to build momentum. But I wasnt really carrying other traces of Abu Dhabi from the previous year.

Hamilton was memorably involved in a tense battle for the title with Max Verstappen during the last campaign but lost out on the World Championship in the controversial final laps of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. In 2022 Mercedes have been unable to match the pace of rivals Red Bull and Ferrari and unless Hamilton achieves a victory in the final two races of the year it will mark the seventime World Champions first season in which he has not claimed a win. Hamiltons current contract with the Silver Arrows expires at the end of 2023 but he recently voiced his intention to remain with the team beyond then.

However the Alfa Romeo name could be sticking around beyond next year according to reputable journalist Dieter Rencken. According to his report Alfa Romeo want to remain in F1 with Haas potentially the perfect fit for the Italian brand. Recently Haas acquired a new title sponsor in the form of Moneygram reportedly worth 20 million per year. With Moneygrams colour scheme matching Alfa Romeos  red white and black colours  theres certainly some logic to it. Haas new sponsorship deal is an important one for the American outfit allowing them to push towards the F1 cost cap for the first time. They are on course for their best finish in the constructors championship for a number of years sitting in eighth overall with two rounds remaining. Haas tricky history with sponsors Haas were forced to drop Russian sponsor Uralkali ahead of the 2022 season. The company was coowned by Nikita Mazepins father Dmitry Mazepin. Haas opted to cut ties with Uralkali and their driver Mazepin due to Russias invasion of Ukraine. In more bizarre circumstances Rich Energy were their sponsors in 2019. Vocal on social media CEO William Storey had big ambitions for Haas and his energy drinks company wanting to take on Red Bull. The partnership ultimately ended at the 2019 British Grand Prix after Rich Energy grew frustrated with Haas competitiveness. Although theres always been a degree of uncertainty and mystery behind the legitimacy of Rich Energys finances and business as a whole.

He was poised to win the race and place first overall when a power unit problem forced him to quit. The Spaniard was really angry about that and said Car 14 stops and there always seems to be a problem with its dependability. I lost one cylinder 20 laps from the finish line which left me with five cylinders and 20 less power. The race was outstanding up until I pulled away from the McLaren and my teammate Esteban Ocon by 20 seconds. I ran my fastest races both here and in Austin. I believe that I have already lost 60 points this year so we add six more for a seventh place making it 66. Everyone else then obviously receives two points more than they ought to. Next season Alonso will switch from Alpine to Aston Martin. ALSO READ Mercedes Predicts a Gloomy Outcome for the Formula One Race in Brazil Saying It Wont Be As Competitive as Mexico
Las Vegas gets a first taste of Formula 1, https://www.grandprix247.com/2022/11/06/las-vegas-gets-a-first-taste-of-formula-1/, Las Vegas gets a first taste of Formula 1Formula 1 took its globehoping extravaganza to the Las Vegas Strip on Saturday for an official launch party on what it believes will be one of the biggest sporting events in the world  The most expensive too. That needs to be recognized and in terms of price positioning we are going to be on the top side because this is Las Vegas and that is the nature of the customer coming to Las Vegas. Las Vegas next year will make it three U.S. stops and five North American stops total with Montreal and Mexico City. There was some sticker shock surrounding the pricing at the inaugural Miami Grand Prix and Las Vegas is going to cost even more. What we want to create is to have different races with different personality with different characteristics with different fans with different price points with different expectations Domenicali said., Las Vegas gets a first taste of Formula 1 Formula 1 took its globehoping extravaganza to the Las Vegas Strip on Saturday for an official launch party on what it believes will be one of the biggest sporting events in the world  The most expensive too. F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali told The Associated Press the Las Vegas Grand Prix will be the most expensive fan experience on next years 24race calendar particularly from a VIP experience. Tickets were scheduled to go on sale late Saturday night with the price of admission starting at 500 for a threeday general admission pass. Those seats were only added after fans complained that hotels planned to purchase massive ticket blocks and repackage them into entertainment experiences ranging from 100000 to 1Million. But ahead of tickets going on sale seats in the grandstands started at 2500 and the only hospitality package with a price was listed for 10000. Formula 1 has a certain positioning with regard to the kind of sport it is Domenicali told The AP. We are going to deliver the greatest spectacle in the world as a statement of F1. That needs to be recognized and in terms of price positioning we are going to be on the top side because this is Las Vegas and that is the nature of the customer coming to Las Vegas. There will be possibilities for people who want to pay less to spend less. As always in life it is the market pulling the price and then on our side is the responsibility to bring a great event. Las Vegas will be the third race on the F1 calendar Based on an explosion in popularity in the United States created by the behindthescenes Netflix docudrama Drive to Survive F1 in May made Miami its second annual race in the country. Las Vegas next year will make it three U.S. stops and five North American stops total with Montreal and Mexico City. There was some sticker shock surrounding the pricing at the inaugural Miami Grand Prix and Las Vegas is going to cost even more. F1 owned by U.S.based Liberty Media will be a firsttime promoter for the Nov. 18 night race that will use famous Vegas landmarks and rush down the Strip. Liberty Media earlier this year purchased a 39acre strip for 240 million for the construction of pit lanes paddocks and hospitality and CEO Greg Maffei on Saturday said the costs of putting on such a spectacle in a showplace city is evident in ticket prices. Given it is our race as a promoter we want to make it a showcase of what can be done at all the races. We want to capitalize on the fan interest which is enormous in the U.S. the demand is massive Maffei told AP and predicted tickets would sell out within hours. Both for us as a company this will be the largest race in terms of revenues. It will also be the most expensive race in terms of costs Maffei added. Thats just the nature of the event the scale and the nature of Vegas. We will try to create economic choices for fans not all fans can pay the top dollar we understand. This is an expensive place to operate and well try to take advantage of the great things Vegas has to offer. The glitz and glamour that F1 has in mind was showcased at Saturdays launch party Seventime champion Lewis Hamilton and fellow drivers Sergio Perez and Alex Albon were brought in for a demonstration run of their F1 cars on the Strip and Albon said hes the one strangers have been approaching saying Youre that Netflix guy. They dont even know my name. Perez told The AP he expected the Las Vegas race to be the biggest sporting event in the world next year and Haas team boss Guenther Steiner couldnt believe the event was even happening. He said when he heard about Las Vegas he thought really on the Strip. How are we going to race cars here But Vegas can make it happen. The Launch Party actually started earlier this week when an F1 car drove down the casino floor of The Wynn and Saturday included a full day of events that included a pit stop challenge driver appearances a drone show above Caesars Palace and a VIP afterparty with Swedish DJ Alesso at a threelevel nightclub inside Caesars. During the driver demonstration run Hamiltons car broke down and he had to catch a ride back. His car had to be pushed back. But the Launch Party is a sampling of what F1 believes can do to make next years Las Vegas race worth the price of admission. Lewis Hamilton Its getting more expensive to go to F1 events Hamilton doesnt know where Vegas entrylevel 500 standingroom only ticket ranks among other F1 races but did note costs have risen for the consumers. Its getting more and more expensive and less accessible to go to our events and I wouldnt think that is a good thing Hamilton told The AP. But with three stops next year across the United States F1 believes it has options and experiences for every type of fan at different price levels. And on the current path Vegas plans to be as glamorous as Monaco maybe more. What we want to create is to have different races with different personality with different characteristics with different fans with different price points with different expectations Domenicali said. If all Grand Prixs were equal it wouldnt be what we wanted. I think what were going to present to our fans in Vegas will be unique and in the U.S. we are just scratching the surface of what we can do. Story by Jenna Fryer
The start of the Verstappen era echoes the end of Vettel's, https://the-race.com/formula-1/the-start-of-the-verstappen-era-echoes-the-end-of-vettels/, The similarities between Max Verstappen and Red Bulls 2022 season and Sebastian Vettels allconquering 2013 campaign for the team are clear. The 2013 success was the fourth consecutive world championship double for Red Bull spearheaded by Vettel. Of course the Red Bull RB9 was strong from the start but it only got better as the season progressed. Late on it was Lotus  in particular Romain Grosjean  who provided the most serious if fleeting competition to Red Bull. Red Bull lodged a protest with the stewards referring the test to an FIA tribunal., A dominant Formula 1 champion the constructors title sewn up with three races to spare a rival that started well but faded and controversy engulfing a big team. The similarities between Max Verstappen and Red Bulls 2022 season and Sebastian Vettels allconquering 2013 campaign for the team are clear. The 2013 success was the fourth consecutive world championship double for Red Bull spearheaded by Vettel. That proved to be the end of an era whereas whats happening this year could perhaps be the early stages of one given Red Bulls strong start to F1s return to groundeffectdependent cars. But although the Red Bull of today has grown dramatically since 2013 annexing more and more of the Milton Keynes industrial estate it resides on over the years its still recognisably the same team. Adrian Newey is still the conceptual inspiration part of a far larger design group populated by exceptional personnel. Many of the engineering team have carried over and there are also familiar faces working on the cars in the garages. Newey indepth Aborted Ferrari switch Verstappen and retirement Read more And then just as now Red Bull was a team that relentlessly pushed the boundaries in F1. Thats the exact phrase team principal Christian Horner used after Red Bull bagged its personalbest 16th victory of the season at Suzuka when asked how proud he was of the team having won all but four of 2022s 20 races to date. Its something that the team can be incredibly proud of said Horner. There are a lot of people sitting around the engineering office and the garage and obviously back in the factory that are all the same people that did that with Sebastian and are doing it again with Max. The DNA of our team is that were a race team. Were a team of racers we push the boundaries were aggressive in the way that we go racing and we follow our passion that is to go out there and do our very very best. I guess there were risks today with the strategy that we took with the soft and maybe they could have run out of tyre. But we are following Dietrich Mateschitzs mantra of no risk no fun. This has certainly been an increasingly enjoyable season ontrack for Red Bull. As the year has progressed it has become more and more dominant. This year thats been at the expense of Ferrari which won two of the first three races with Charles Leclerc but has only added two victories since. In 2013 that role was played by Mercedes. Then Mercedes had yet to become the powerhouse F1 force it became in the hybrid era. The Silver Arrows claimed its first F1 victory since 1955 the previous season with Nico Rosberg and started 2013 strongly. Eight times in the first 11 races Mercedes took pole position  five of those for new arrival Lewis Hamilton the other three for Rosberg  although victories were a little harder to come by. Rosberg won in Monaco and Germany with Hamilton triumphing in Hungary. But the iconic moment was Hamiltons tyre shredding in Britain while leading prompting Pirelli to revert to the more robust 2012 tyres. That coincided with Red Bull really hitting its stride. Of course the Red Bull RB9 was strong from the start but it only got better as the season progressed. Vettel won all nine races after the August break a run Red Bull could repeat this year across the same number of races. The only difference is that Sergio Perezs win in Singapore means its not been Verstappen all the way. While Mercedes felt quietly encouraged that Red Bull pushed on to the end of the 2013 season given the imminent regulation change to hybrid engines one that required significant changes to the cars that are often overlooked it fell back. Late on it was Lotus  in particular Romain Grosjean  who provided the most serious if fleeting competition to Red Bull. The Mercedes W04 the first overseen by Mike Elliott  now Mercedes technical director then head of aero  was quick but rear tyre degradation was a problem. It was also a car Hamilton struggled to get the feel for meaning he faced a tough challenge from incumbent Rosberg. But it was quick it just wasnt as quick as the Red Bull. Reassessing Nico Rosberg  and how he beat Hamilton Read more The pattern is not dissimilar to that of 2022. Talk then was of a Mercedes title push in the first half of the year an idea that later seemed risible. The same could be said of Ferraris challenge this year which it now seems absurd to have taken seriously. Vettel also performed stunningly well in 2013. At one with team and car hardworking and capable of extracting tremendous pace from a car that produced more underfloor downforce than others without any of the downsides of the highrake concept. He also continued to benefit from exhaust blowing albeit in reduced form thanks to a series of rule changes that had gradually eroded its benefit. Like for Verstappen Vettel victories became inevitable. Whether leading from the front and keeping the competition just out of reach jumping ahead as other cars hit tyre trouble or even battling up the order as he did in India he was superb. Of course there was also the Multi 21 controversy in Malaysia when he overtook teammate Mark Webber against team orders such was his ruthless desire to win. Verstappen has done nothing like that this year but that neardesperation to keep racking up the victories is a factor both share. Verstappen shows no signs of easing off didnt even entertain the idea of potentially helping teammate Perez win the Mexican Grand Prix and likely wont be happy unless he adds wins number 15 and 16 to the tally in Brazil and Abu Dhabi. Hes also had to be even more versatile than Vettel in the way he has chased victories. Ferrari has more consistently started on pole position this year than the Mercedes did in 2013 and only five of Verstappens wins so far have come from first on the grid. One Spa came from 14th. As for the offtrack controversy in 2013 that engulfed Mercedes. It participated in an infamous secret tyre test at Barcelona. News of this test emerged during the Monaco Grand Prix weekend. Testing with the current years cars was banned but Pirelli wanted to run with a representative car after earlyseason tyre problems. Mercedes was set up to run at Barcelona as a result with FIA approval but rival teams were not informed. Red Bull lodged a protest with the stewards referring the test to an FIA tribunal. This reprimanded Mercedes and banned it from that seasons threeday young driver test because this track testing being carried out without the knowledge consent or participation of other teams. Pirelli was also reprimanded for conduct prejudicial to the championship and the secrecy of the test which race drivers Hamilton and Rosberg participated in. While perhaps not on the same scale the similarities to this years cost cap controversy are clear. It was certainly a huge talking point. Vettels Jekyll and Hyde career leaves him short of F1s elite Read more What is most striking about Red Bulls 2013 and Red Bulls 2022 is that on both occasions it was a team and driver very much at one supported by a capable number two driver producing a rare level of dominance. Such seasons may be criticised as boring or too easy. But while they may be too predictable and lack the intensity of the title fights that preceded them both in 2012 Vettel vs Alonso and 2021 Verstappen vs Hamilton they are far from easy to achieve. What we dont know is what follows. But while looming rule changes meant Red Bulls 2013 dominance was always potentially going to be interrupted the following season theres no reason why Red Bull cant be just as strong next year. And just as in 2013 whether or not intrigue will be restored likely relies on one of Mercedes or Ferrari upping their game.
Carlos Sainz: Ferrari driver 'had to reinvent myself' to challenge Charles Leclerc, https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/63498883, Ferrari have had an upanddown season but Carlos Sainz says they have stayed unitedCarlos Sainz is talking about reinvention about reconfiguring his entire approach to driving to try to get on terms with his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc this year. He fought for victory with Verstappen in Canada just losing out in a race Leclerc started from the back with an enginerelated grid penalty. After Silverstone Sainz outqualified Leclerc in Hungary Belgium the USA and at the last race in Mexico where Leclerc complained of engine problems. I dont know. To go through such a difficult season as we did with so few problems in the team is something to be valued., Ferrari have had an upanddown season but Carlos Sainz says they have stayed united Carlos Sainz is talking about reinvention about reconfiguring his entire approach to driving to try to get on terms with his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc this year. The 28yearold Spaniard has had a breakthrough season  taking his first pole position and his first win  but the big concern for this thoughtful perfectionist has been that for a long time in 2022 he struggled to meet his own high standards. It has been an extremely challenging season for me Sainz says. I found a lot of setbacks at the beginning of the year with this new car with the new regulations that didnt adapt to my driving style. I had to reinvent myself in many ways to try and find the pace. I didnt give up. I kept pushing even in the difficult moments and you can see it paying off now at the end of the season in terms of speed. Those few lines are Sainz in a nutshell  honest selfcritical humble determined hardworking. It can sound esoteric when a Formula 1 driver talks in this way  of driving style of struggling with his car. But these things really matter. Look at Red Bull where the car was heavy and somewhat ponderous at the beginning of the year. Max Verstappen was unable to exploit his extravagant skills to the point that  early in the season  he was barely quicker than teammate Sergio Perez. A bit of weight was taken out and the car came alive for the Dutchman who suddenly became effectively unbeatable. Or at McLaren where Daniel Ricciardos struggles with the cornerentry characteristics of the car left him so far adrift of Lando Norris the team terminated his contract a year early. A winner of eight grands prix all but one taken in swashbuckling style with Red Bull finds himself without a seat on the grid next year. At Ferrari Sainzs struggles manifested themselves in Leclercs overwhelming superiority in the first part of the season. The car has an oversteer balance  where the rear is loose and tends to move and slide  which Leclerc loved but Sainz could not handle as well. Leclerc outqualified Sainz in the first eight races in a row at an average advantage of 0.265 seconds as the older man struggled with the characteristics of the car. I have never been 0.20.3secs off any teammate in F1 and I can never accept that says Sainz who was actually marginally faster than Verstappen in qualifying when they were teammates at Toro Rosso at the beginning of their careers and neckandneck with Norris at McLaren in 201920. I always feel like I am quick in any kind of car and for the first time in my career I found myself with a very competitive car but one I didnt feel comfortable and natural with. I had to challenge myself and open up new roads of setup and driving style that I wish I didnt have to open because I wish everything had come a lot more natural and positively. But it happened this way and I stayed disciplined. I tried a lot of things and I made a lot of mistakes trying things. But it was all about trial and error and then coming back and discovering a new path that was a little step forward. A breakthrough and success Gradually things began to come together for Sainz. He fought for victory with Verstappen in Canada just losing out in a race Leclerc started from the back with an enginerelated grid penalty. Then at the British Grand Prix came that first pole won superbly in the wet with Leclerc third behind Verstappen. The maiden win also happened that weekend albeit only after Ferrari had scuppered Leclercs chances with a strategy error. And gradually the qualifying battle has shifted. After Silverstone Sainz outqualified Leclerc in Hungary Belgium the USA and at the last race in Mexico where Leclerc complained of engine problems. In that period the average gap between them has been only 0.013secs  still in Leclercs favour but so small as to be almost insignificant. Against a man some regard as perhaps the fastest in F1 over one lap it is some achievement. Im realistic Sainz says and I know how good Charles is in those conditions. This year he has been driving at a level that is very close to Max or any other driver. And for me hes in a way done a perfect season apart from the two or three typical mistakes everyone does in a year or the luck which maybe he has been lacking the same as me. I am not proud because I am not ahead. The day I am ahead in the statistics is the day I will be proud. Until then I will keep working at it keep finding lap time in myself. But its a statistic that makes me proud about the progress  not giving up not letting myself get comfortable with being 0.2secs behind and always challenging myself to find new ways of driving cars which is not easy. When you see other drivers on the grid you can see it is difficult to turn around a season or turn around the feeling with the car. You dont see it very often. The fact I managed to do that makes me happy. While Verstappen has won the title for the second successive year Sainz is sixth in the standings A lot of people dont perceive my speed Sainz says he does not like talking about his strengths as a driver because when he does he reads interviews back and regrets it. Every time I do an interview and say my positives and I read them I say Ah this sounds superarrogant. Maybe I go more towards the humble too much and stay in that way  modest. But whenever I see something a bit arrogant I kill myself for it. So I always like to let you guys give your opinion of what you see as my strengths while I criticise my weaknesses. Nevertheless like all F1 drivers he spends a lot of time analysing his qualities  good and bad. When told the qualifying statistics he said he knew them already. Of course I know he says. But he wouldnt bring it up in an interview unless explicitly asked. He accepts that may not always be to his benefit. A lot of people... sometimes they dont perceive my speed Sainz says. And I know how fast I am I just dont like talking about it. I dont give it value because if I know in myself and my engineers and the people I work with know it I dont need more people to know it. Maybe I am not doing myself any favours but it is how I am and I am not going to change. The race execution has been a weaker point For all the inner confidence he recognises too that he still has plenty to work on. Sainz beat Leclerc in Mexico but the strong trend this year is that Leclerc has been the faster Ferrari driver in races even in the second half of the season after Sainz made his progress in qualifying. Sainz is happy to admit that is an area in which he needs to progress. The race execution this year has been a weaker point of mine compared to the past he says. This year we are struggling a lot with tyre management on these new Pirelli tyres. The starts with this car for some reason have been extremely difficult and we have an inherent problem that doesnt allow us to get off the line as well as in previous years. With these tyres I dont control as well the tyre degradation and the race pace and its more difficult to be flexible and it doesnt open up as many strategy choices as I would like to have or as I had in the past with McLaren. These are points I am going to work on in the final races and into next season to be more complete. But as you said the qualifying gap has closed down a lot. I know Im up against one of the fastest qualifiers  if not the fastest qualifier  on the grid and so to be so close it makes me proud to know there has been a lot of effort put into it but also that its paying off. I am relatively coldblooded One aspect of race management though has certainly been a Sainz strength this year. In a season in which Ferraris strategy has been exposed  they have made a series of errors that have cost Leclerc big points  Sainz has been a shining light. On a number of occasions he has appeared to be running strategy from the cockpit contradicting his engineers and forcing them into changing their choices. One key example was in Monaco when he rejected their decision to come in for intermediate tyres as the track dried  something that wrecked Leclercs chances of victory  and instead insisted on staying out and changing straight to slicks. It secured him second place between the Red Bulls while Leclerc following instructions and changing to inters started a series of events that dropped him from the lead to fourth. Likewise at Silverstone after a safetycar period in which Ferraris decision not to pit Leclerc for fresh tyres led to him dropping from the lead to fourth Sainz refused  as politely as he could  an order to back up and create a gap to his teammate to protect him from those behind on the grounds that doing so would compromise both their races. This eased his path to victory as he passed Leclerc who then fought valiantly on his old tyres to delay Perez and Lewis Hamiltons Mercedes. Sainz says the ability to read the race from the car is both natural and something he actively tries to develop. I am relatively coldblooded in many aspects of life he says. Sometimes maybe too much. And I dont show maybe my tension passion. But it is also something I work on. Having a good fitness level always allows you to have more brain space when you are driving. Having good confidence with the car and yourself helps you to have more brain space to think about whats going on in the race. And I feel like I always have a clear mind when racing and I can identify the opportunities and the chances to know what is right or wrong from the inside of the cockpit that sometimes is the biggest challenge. I know its one of my strengths and I try to exploit it whenever I have a chance. Sainz says Ferrari want to take another step next season A year of realisation for Ferrari For Ferrari as a whole the season has been a rollercoaster. There is considerable satisfaction that they finally managed to return to competitiveness and that Leclerc was able to go toetotoe with Verstappen for the championship for a while. The cars outright speed is evident from the fact noone will be able to match Leclercs score of nine pole positions regardless of what happens in the final two races in Brazil and Abu Dhabi. But there is also an acknowledgement that mistakes and reliability problems torpedoed their chances questions as to why the car is rarely as effective in races as in qualifying and concern they have fallen behind in the development race just as they did the last time they had a competitive car in 2017 and 2018. There are definitely some mixed feelings in the team Sainz says. We are superproud of the progress we have done with the car to get back to where we are. But this has also been a year of realisation that there are still areas to work on and improve. We are being superdisciplined and supercoherent and ultracritical behind closed doors as to which areas we need to improve to match our competitors in certain areas or be better than them which has to be the target. The team is taking note of everything and we are going to try and take another step next year. Will it be enough I dont know. But its definitely a target. In the past a year such as this might have led to heads rolling at Ferrari. But Sainz says team principal Mattia Binotto has stuck to the noblame culture he is determined to engender after its success at Mercedes and Red Bull. Its incredibly difficult to execute and especially in a team like Ferrari where there is so much pressure and so much attention on us and everyone wants changes immediately as soon as something is wrong Sainz says. Mattia has done an excellent job at not losing the cool head at any point. We have had a lot of difficult moments a lot of criticism and he has remained stuck to his principles. Noone has been fired. We stayed united in the most difficult moments and it shows the progress of our culture. It is always exposed to criticism and high attention on all our mistakes. When we win its incredible  it is the best win in the world to win for Ferrari. To go through such a difficult season as we did with so few problems in the team is something to be valued.
Formula 1 | Bottas talks about his passion for cycling: 'An F1 stress reliever' - US Sports, https://lookcharms.com/formula-1-bottas-talks-about-his-passion-for-cycling-an-f1-stress-reliever-2/, Valtteri Bottas is a great cycling enthusiast having grown up getting used to cycling in his native Finland whatever the weather. Moreover a few days before competing in the United States Grand Prix Bottas took part in a Gravel bike race in Kansas which he won.  I try to get involved in some of my passions which are nature cycling but also coffee. She also finished sixth in the very first Gravel World Championships in history a few weeks ago although we see her mainly in road cycling. Bottas happy that F1 is active in the face of climate changeAlthough a Formula 1 driver Bottas is far from immune to climate change., Valtteri Bottas is a great cycling enthusiast having grown up getting used to cycling in his native Finland whatever the weather. The pilot who won 10 Formula 1 victories says he did not hesitate to face the cold the wind the rain or even the snow on his bicycle to go to class.  I was cycling my daily commute to school even if it was snowing or raining. It was normal for me and so I didnt find it difficult I got used to the wet weather.  Moreover a few days before competing in the United States Grand Prix Bottas took part in a Gravel bike race in Kansas which he won. The Finn explains how he fell in love with this discipline which consists of using a bike whose frame is very similar to that of a road bike but equipped with wider tires thus allowing you to take dirt roads .  Gravel racing is growing rapidly and becoming more and more popular especially in the United States. I took part in my first race last year in Colorado.   Most people ride road bikes or mountain bikes but Gravel gives you the opportunity to explore a bit more to go on roads without any traffic or anyone. Thats the aspect enjoyable of this discipline.  Bottas will launch a new bike race in Finland The Alfa Romeo driver has even created his own gravel race FNLD GRVL the first edition of which will take place next year near Lahti a Finnish city with 120000 inhabitants.  I try to get involved in some of my passions which are nature cycling but also coffee. No doubt there will be good coffee during this race.   I like to reward myself with a beer or a gin and tonic after a bike ride so that might be another possibility. I think there will be several things related to the event that I am passionate.   In Gravel its quite common to see people making campfires and baking marshmallows and stuff but we want to make Finlands nature accessible so people can explore it before maybe doing a sauna or to go swimming right after the race.  A passion that turned into love Bottas passion for cycling extends to his private life he who is in a relationship with Tiffany Cromwell an Australian professional cyclist. She also finished sixth in the very first Gravel World Championships in history a few weeks ago although we see her mainly in road cycling.  When I started training more systematically for motorsport cycling was always part of it for cardio. But when I met Tiffany my interest took it to the next level.   When I do a tough training session or even a race I do it first and foremost to have fun and challenge myself.   Its painful when your heart rate is at its peak for the two or three hours of a gravel race so its something that makes you stronger in a way. Its a sport that makes you allows you to constantly push your limits. Its very satisfying.  In addition to the sporting challenge Bottas likes the fact of being able to escape into the great outdoors.  Its kind of like a stress reliever. I can go to quite remote places explore and forget the hustle and bustle of F1 when Im on my bike.   Its very important on a mental level. I love nature and clean air pure water beautiful landscapes. The less people you meet the easier it is to disconnect.  Bottas happy that F1 is active in the face of climate change Although a Formula 1 driver Bottas is far from immune to climate change.  I have of course seen the effects of climate change in Finland summer and winter have become more extreme. I could already notice a difference in my childhood. Some places have become very windy in Finland and it was not not like this 20 years ago.   F1 is pushing for a greener world it took time for that but people are finally taking it seriously. The teams and the different organizations are making great efforts in this perspective.   At the end of the day its about simple choices like going to work or going to the supermarket for example are you going to use your car equipped with a V8 or take your bike These are simple things.

The demo was the main attraction to the daylong event at Caesars Palace. On 40 acres of land on the northeast corner of Harmon Avenue and Koval Lane F1 will construct a 300000squarefoot fourstory paddock building which will serve as the hub of activity during the 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix. Its hard to make a statement in Vegas because everything is so big said Greg Maffei CEO of Liberty Media the ownership group of Formula One. This paddock building will be a sign of our longterm commitment to the Vegas community. It will serve as a yearround attraction to our fans and will be one of our most spectacular facilities. Between the land purchase and building construction F1 will have invested 500 million in Las Vegas before a race even occurs according to Gov. Steve Sisolak. Between the land and the construction of the paddock F1 will be investing about 500 million in the facility alone according to Gov.

They told me between the land and what theyre building that theyre putting here thats a half a billion dollars right here. On top of everything else theyre building. All the stands on the Strip all the other things that theyre putting together. The economic impact this is going to make in the economy in Las Vegas is going to be astronomical. The Las Vegas Grand Prix isnt just a onetime thing the race is signed to occur at least three times starting next year. But hope is to make the race the marquee one on F1s schedule for the foreseeable future. The intention is for this to be a permanent event said Steve Hill president and CEO of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. Its going to be spectacular. We want it every year and they want to be here. F1 officials plan to use the paddock site for other events outside of nonrace weekends getting their monies worth from the eyepopping facility. This is a true investment in Clark County in the community said Clark County Commissioner Michael Naft. This will be a permanent facility. Yes it will be used for the worlds greatest events for Formula One events. But it will also be here yearround employing people putting people to work. And also boosting our economy and giving us one more thing to be proud of. Formula One CEO Stefano Domenicali said the paddock building cements Formula Ones commitment to the city. We want to stay for a long time Domenicali said. Its with great excitement that were there to celebrate this moment that is just the beginning.  This will be the F1 statement in Las Vegas. We know when you come here you need to be big. When tickets went on sale and some resorts room schedules were opened up this week the price shock caught some people by surprise.

Room rates began around 700 per night but were well over 1000 per night for locations along the race route. While the costs are high the race will draw droves of people from all over the world who will gladly pay the heightened fees Sisolak said. People are willing to pay from all over the world to come see it he said. People are going to be staying all over town here. Every hotel has got increased room prices by 300400 percent. Its not that theyre gouging people theyve got an investment in this as well. The skyhigh hotel prices speak to the international draw a segment that is still slowly returning to Las Vegas postpandemic Naft said. People from all over the world have been watching for those rates become available and bookings open up Naft said. It also speaks to the incredible impact this is going to have on our economy. Those room rates also translate to hotel tax revenue sales tax revenue and those are the dollars that literally help boost the economy for people like me and family who live here. The people who will be in the stands around the Strip and surrounding area next year arent the only ones who will be excited. The drivers they will be watching are itching to race along one of the most famous stretches of roads in the world. I think its going to be wild to be honest said F1 star driver George Russell. Super excited to come here and race in Vegas. I think weve seen the momentum that Formula One has in America and bringing the race to Vegas is just topping that off at another level. As drivers as people in the sport were excited. Contact Mick Akers at makersreviewjournal.com or 7023872920. Follow mickakers on Twitter.
‘I always believed in the project’ – Max Verstappen on Red Bull his second title and how long he plans to race in F1, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.i-always-believed-in-the-project-max-verstappen-on-red-bull-his-second-title.7mbvN7HjprbEf3VGYDKFzM.html, Though it is now under the Red Bull Powertrains banner courtesy of a brandnew division and huge investment from the energy drinks firm Honda continue to play an integral role  and its their constant development from one year to the next that has given Red Bull the grunt to fight at the sharp end. With the regulations more or less staying the same for the coming years we can take advantage of that. He adds Red Bull are my second family they were already world champions before I joined. We had a bit of a tough time at the start but I always believed in the project. And thats helped us make that final jump that we were missing to fight for a title. Verstappens second title has been impressive for different reasons. Verstappen described Red Bull as his second family and believes they can be successful for yearsThe first one was very emotional because you realise you have achieved everything in the sport you wanted to achieve he says., With pack up well under way at Suzuka on Sunday night Max Verstappen took five minutes to sit down with those closest in his team open a beer and reflect on what he had just achieved  the defence of his Formula 1 world title. There would not be much time to celebrate that night as he had already planned to fly back home so he could maximise the hours with his family and friends before the following race in Austin. Between a string of interviews  including one with us for broadcasters  there was only really time for a quick team photo debrief and short calls with his father and then his mother. READ MORE Hes been perfect  Horner full of praise after Verstappens recordbreaking victory Racing drivers dont tend to dwell on success. The focus is always on what is next. Youre only as good as your next lap. But in those five minutes Verstappen gave himself the chance to take it all in. This has been a remarkable season  one which after three races saw the now twotime world champion 46 points adrift in the championship hunt courtesy of two mechanicalrelated retirements. But he then went on a run of 13 wins in 17 races smashing the record of most wins in a year 14 with two races still to go. Victory in Mexico also set a record of the most points in a year 416. Its been an incredible season says Verstappen. As a whole team we definitely didnt expect something like this. We had a competitive start but we retired two times in three. It was not the best start to try and defend the title. After that we had a great turnaround  we kept on pushing kept on believing kept on improving the car which was the most important area. It is why we are here today. As a team we made very few mistakes. You cant be perfect but for most of the races we have been close to perfect. Verstappen and Red Bulls season did not get off to the best start after two retirements in the first three races  including in Australia Though Red Bull failed to win a title between 2014 and 2020 they remained operationally shrewd throughout and alongside building a mighty car for the newfor2022 regulations that has been one of the fundamental reasons they have been so relentlessly successful this year. Another has been the power unit in the back of the car. Though it is now under the Red Bull Powertrains banner courtesy of a brandnew division and huge investment from the energy drinks firm Honda continue to play an integral role  and its their constant development from one year to the next that has given Red Bull the grunt to fight at the sharp end. READ MORE I never thought Id be able to win 14 races in a year says recordbreaker Verstappen in Mexico Working together with Honda has been incredible and is incredible and they definitely deserve it that weve won it on their own track added Verstappen at Suzuka. Thanks goes out to the whole team back at the factory and those contributing to the powertrains division. They have been working flatout nobody is lacking motivation  and thats how I like to see. Verstappen himself has been key to their success. Having joined the team back in 2016 winning a race on debut with them in Barcelona he has set about building a dynasty that is showing shoots similar to that of Michael Schumacher at Ferrari Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes and Sebastian Vettel before him at Red Bull. But he knows its more than just about him  its about the people around him and how everyone gels together to work towards the same goal. Verstappen has been key to Red Bulls return to success after joining in 2016 and winning his first race for the team in Spain That building something special is what were trying to do he says. With the regulations more or less staying the same for the coming years we can take advantage of that. He adds Red Bull are my second family they were already world champions before I joined. We had a bit of a tough time at the start but I always believed in the project. The whole team we have  back at the factory designing the car combined with the powertrain division  we have a really great group of people who I think can be successful for quite a few years. TOP 10 We rank the best drives of double world champion Verstappens F1 career so far It goes higher up than me to make sure we find the right people and putting them into the right position. What is most important is that everyone gets on well and everyone understands their role. Honda and now coming into our own powertrains division its about understanding how to work together. Implementing the two together has been really strong the last few years. And thats helped us make that final jump that we were missing to fight for a title. Verstappens second title has been impressive for different reasons. Last year he fought tooth and nail to the seasonending race and clinched the title on the final lap of the season edging out Lewis Hamilton. This year after a slow start he has gone on an extraordinary run of form that has made the title a formality. Its no wonder then that each championship feels different. Verstappen described Red Bull as his second family and believes they can be successful for years The first one was very emotional because you realise you have achieved everything in the sport you wanted to achieve he says. The second one because of the season we have had is probably more rewarding. Its very different feelings which I think is great because it would be a little bit boring if they are the same. READ MORE I was there when Jolyon Palmer Will Buxton Mark Hughes and more reflect on Max Verstappen milestones Winning that first title had a positive effect on Verstappen in that it made him more relaxed and has seen him pull back on his allout attacking approach by the smallest of margins. In doing so it has also made him a more potent force. Make no mistake having an incredible car with a team working efficiently in terms of operations and strategy has made life easier  but hes still had to get the job done. You grow as a person every year you learn a lot from every single year what has happened at every single race you try to improve as a driver he says. I dont think you improve in terms of raw speed but because of the experiences you have had in the past you try to put that into play. In some tricky situations sometimes that can help you out because of the previous experiences you have. Verstappen has appeared a lot more relaxed behind the wheel this season after winning his first championship

Fernando Alonso open to race with Max Verstappen beyond F1, https://www.sportskeeda.com/f1/news-fernando-alonso-open-race-max-verstappen-beyond-f1, Fernando Alonso has said that hes open to racing with Max Verstappen in other racing categories beyond F1. When quizzed if the LeMans team could feature Verstappens dad as the third driver Alonso joked that he would rather have the junior Verstappen behind the wheel. Lets see if Max is that lucky.Fernando Alonsos frustration after another DNF in MexicoFernando Alonso was having a very strong race in Mexico. He was on his way to finish the race as the best of the rest but a late race power unit issue meant he had to retire. I think I lost 60 points already this year so we add another six for seventh place so it is 66., Fernando Alonso has said that hes open to racing with Max Verstappen in other racing categories beyond F1. The two drivers share a great camaraderie and have expressed respect and admiration for each other. In an interview with De Telegraaf Alonso was asked if he would be interested in racing alongside Verstappen to which the Spaniard said I know Max wants to do some endurance one day and I know hed like to do the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Im certainly open to doing that together. I think we should give the idea a chance if we can drive for a competitive team. When quizzed if the LeMans team could feature Verstappens dad as the third driver Alonso joked that he would rather have the junior Verstappen behind the wheel. He said His father for Le Mans At the moment I prefer Max. But I also have a lot of respect for Jos. He could develop the role of team principal Alonso was also asked whether Verstappen would emulate the seven titles of Lewis Hamilton and Michael Schumacher. He said It will be difficult for him to reach the seven titles of Lewis and Michael Schumacher. Certainly Max has the talent to get there but you have to have a car that is very competitive for many years and you never have that guarantee. Now its easy. Everything points to Red Bull dominating in the next few years but we dont know for sure. Lets see if Max is that lucky. Fernando Alonsos frustration after another DNF in Mexico Fernando Alonso was having a very strong race in Mexico. He was on his way to finish the race as the best of the rest but a late race power unit issue meant he had to retire. The Spaniard was very frustrated with that saying Car 14 stops and it always seem like there is reliability issues for Car 14. 20 laps before the end I lost one cylinder so I was running with five cylinders so I had 20 less power. I was 20 seconds in front of the McLaren and my teammate Esteban Ocon  so I think until that point the race was exceptional. Here and Austin I did my best races in terms of pace. I think I lost 60 points already this year so we add another six for seventh place so it is 66. Obviously everyone else then scores two more points than what they should. Alonso will move to Aston Martin next season from Alpine. Poll  0 votes

Ratcliffe is clearly impressed with Hamiltons driving skills away from Formula 1 having to hold on as the seventime Formula 1 world champion put the car to the test.

Formula 1 | Hamilton and his 'Mercedes F1 family': 'We have no limits' - US Sports, https://lookcharms.com/formula-1-hamilton-and-his-mercedes-f1-family-we-have-no-limits/, After Fernando Alonso Lewis Hamilton is the second oldest driver on the F1 grid. Another element that makes Lewis Hamilton feel so happy at Mercedes his boss Lewis Hamilton also imposes an iron discipline to hold on during the many weekends of Grands Prix he says. Would George Russell have Lewis Hamilton as a mentor and model Behind the scenes moreover Lewis Hamilton is doing a colossal job to advance development as much as possible., After Fernando Alonso Lewis Hamilton is the second oldest driver on the F1 grid. However the driver continues to be and feel in excellent physical shape as evidenced by his results during this second half of the season where George Russell appears more in the background. With the FOM the Mercedes driver confirmed that he was at the top of his physical form but also mentally.  As far as my physical wellbeing goes Ive never felt better physically because I really focused on that as I got older.  I generally like to drive and I work on a plan. I cant tell you what it is yet but theres no limit to what we can do.  If Lewis Hamilton feels so good about himself it is also thanks to his offroad projects with Mercedes in particular with Mission 44 to promote inclusiveness and diversity in sport. I want to be creative and keep doing all the other things I get to do. I can be myself in this team  and the support from Mercedes has been amazing since day one. Together its not just about winning we can be one of the many people around the world trying to change the world for the better  we can do that Mercedes its a huge brand that can have a huge influence on the world.  Another element that makes Lewis Hamilton feel so happy at Mercedes his boss  Toto Wolff directeur de lquipe Mercedes is one of my best friends. Weve had tough times weve had tough negotiations theres been emotional outbursts roller coasters of emotions together over the years but were like family. I want whats best for him. He wants whats best for me.  We can always pick up the phone and talk about whatever we want. Our values are the same and our goals are the same  for the brand to help this team grow and achieve its goals.  Lewis Hamilton also imposes an iron discipline to hold on during the many weekends of Grands Prix he says.  So I try to use all my time and the quietest part of the day especially in Grands Prix is the end of the day because theres no one around me and thats is where I have no distractions. I can review the data  and Im in constant contact with the simulation team at the factory so while its running Im able to have live interactions with the rider whos on the track.  I eat on the track and Im exhausted once Im done. I start to relax at the end I come back to the hotel and there is little time between going to bed and waking up  thats what I like.  I dont want to finish here early and go to dinner. I dont feel like going to dinner and wasting time chattering away. Im here for one reason and thats to win races. For me this le dner les autres vnements durant un weekend de Grand Prix is a distraction so I dont do it often if ever.  Would George Russell have Lewis Hamilton as a mentor and model Lewis Hamilton however had a hair to scratch  much younger than him  in the person of George Russell who replaced Valtteri Bottas this year. The arrival of George Russell could have appeared as a transfer of power possibly taking place under tension However this is not the case and Lewis Hamilton is currently working very well with his teammate and compatriot. Lewis Hamilton describes his mentorship with him.  As for the arrival of George he was one of the youngest pilots jeunes pilotes Mercedes  he used to sit behind during debriefings and engineering before so he knows the process.  He arrives and fits in he knows what to expect. And from my side I just tried to be as welcoming and include it  trying to communicate a lot about the car what can I test what can you test for take us where we want  I just try to work with him like I did with Valtteri. When you add new people it takes time for everyone to get into the rhythm but he did an amazing job we found a decent rhythm between us quite early and we continue to work on all points weak to continue to be on this rhythm.  Engineer Lewis Hamilton However even at the top of his form Lewis Hamilton cannot fight for victories on a regular basis so disappointing is the Mercedes W13 and so solid is Max Verstappens Red Bull. Much remains to be done and the Briton knows it. The slope we have to climb is enormous.  For us its important to imagine that its the biggest steepest and most difficult mountain to climb because if you think its going to be a normal hill you wont achieve your goals. You have to think this is the hardest climb you could imagine which means you have to dig deep.  Behind the scenes moreover Lewis Hamilton is doing a colossal job to advance development as much as possible. He talks about this work behind the scenes he had notably experimented with original settings at the start of the year to try to unravel the mystery of the Mercedes. There is a lot of work we have already done so far to understand where we are where we went wrong in previous decisions that were made last year and this year.   As for taking the right steps for next year its not easy to navigate because there are a lot of different options but communication is what Im trying to work on with everyone making sure theres no misunderstanding about what I feel in the car and what I want in the car and making sure were continually creating a dialogue.  These days I sat with Shov le chef de piste Andrew ShovlinRon Meadows directeur sportif and Mike Elliott directeur technique  by simply asking questions  this is what worries me this is what keeps me awake what can we do about it How can I help you do better do more Theres not much we can do as we have to trust the process but its about letting people know youre there  its not up to them to do it on their own we will do it together.

Protestors blocked some roadways to Sao Paolo airport in a bid to protest the decision against their favorite candidate. To further fuel the fire pictures of F1 cargo having been stuck in the protests emerged on social media causing further cancelation speculation amongst fans. The sport however has confirmed that the race will continue as scheduled from November 11th to 13th 2022. Being a highdownforce track the circuit at Interlagos is likely to suit Ferrari and Mercedes over Red Bull. With quite a long straight into Turn 1 however the RB18 is likely to be dominant in the final sector. With early forecasts indicating heavy rain throughout the race weekend predictions for the race have been turned on their heads with no clear favorite. The battle for P2 in the drivers championship between Sergio Perez and Charles Leclerc is still going strong and is likely to go on till the very end of the season in Abu Dhabi. Poll  0 votes

The German has been part of the F1 paddock since 2007 when he made his debut with BMW Sauber. He would go on to become the youngest F1 world champion in 2010. In the subsequent years Vettel became the youngest twotime threetime and fourtime world champion winning four consecutive titles.

For Vettel who has lived and breathed F1 for the last 15 years he said that its not going to be an easy transition. Refusing to rule out a possible return he said to Der Spiegel Id like to rule it out. But I cant. I have no idea how Ill be ticking in a year or two. As far as the physical is concerned I do a sport that you could still return to after a twoyear break. He continued However I hope that in two years I can say No thanks I dont need racing anymore. Im not sure if I want to see the races at all after retirement. Formula 1 was my life purpose for 16 years. Now I secretly expect myself to cope without Formula 1  like Im going into rehab. If you like something you can also be attached to it. I want to go the other way detach myself and find out there are other exciting things. The Aston Martin driver 36 is 11th in the driver standings in his final F1 season with two races to go. Sebastian Vettel urges Max Verstappen to target 16 wins in a season Max Verstappen beat Sebastian Vettel and Michael Schumachers record for most wins in a season 13 by winning the Mexican GP last week. Vettel was quite complimentary of Verstappen and urged the Red Bull driver to target two more wins which the Dutchman will achieve by winning the last two races. Vettel said Well done to him. I think hes had a hell of a season so hopefully he goes on and get 16 wins by the end of the year because anything else will be a disappointment. It is great for Red Bull and I still know some people there so I am really happy for them. He continued Obviously they have a lot of momentum from last year and the car this year is incredible. They won races even though they were heavier than anybody else and I think now theyve finally got the weight out. So the car is there but Max is doing an amazing job as well. Vettel now has only two races left in his career. It will be interesting to see what lies ahead for him. Poll  0 votes
Red Bull advisor predicts 'it will be difficult to build a future together' if Mick Schumacher stays at Haas, https://www.sportskeeda.com/f1/news-red-bull-advisor-predicts-it-will-difficult-build-future-together-mick-schumacher-stays-haas, Red Bull chief advisor Helmut Marko feels Mick Schumacher might not remain at Haas for the 2023 F1 season. Recapping Mick Schumachers second season in F1 Helmut Marko admitted that the driver started the season with far too many accidents. The Red Bull advisor however was complimentary of the Germans second half of the season where he scored points and has been the better Haas driver. Nico Hulkenberg a perfect replacement for Mick Schumacher MarkoHelmut Marko revealed that he felt Nico Hulkenberg could prove to be the perfect replacement for Mick Schumacher. Meanwhile rumors abound in the paddock that Nico Hulkenberg could effectively be making a return to the sport next season as a Haas driver replacing Mick Schumacher., Red Bull chief advisor Helmut Marko feels Mick Schumacher might not remain at Haas for the 2023 F1 season. Marko feels that the way Guenther Steiner has publicly ridiculed Schumacher shows that the team has no confidence in the German and does not see a future with him. Speaking to the media on the subject of Schumachers future Marko said When you criticise your driver so openly and that has happened a few times it shows that no confidence within the team exists. Then it will be difficult to build a future together. Recapping Mick Schumachers second season in F1 Helmut Marko admitted that the driver started the season with far too many accidents. The Red Bull advisor however was complimentary of the Germans second half of the season where he scored points and has been the better Haas driver. Marko said Judged from the outside the first half of his season did not seem strong with many serious accidents and incidents resulting in a lot of damage. That of course has major consequences for the team. But on the other hand there are good races in Britain and Austria. He managed to improve really well in the second half of the season sometimes having some bad luck with unlucky Haas strategies and technical problems. Nico Hulkenberg a perfect replacement for Mick Schumacher Marko Helmut Marko revealed that he felt Nico Hulkenberg could prove to be the perfect replacement for Mick Schumacher. The German veteran has always been a quick driver and proved himself earlier this season in his two races as a substitute for Sebastian Vettel. Marko said If there were a great promise for the future I would bet my money on it but I dont see anyone who fits that profile. And for the team it has a lot at stake. The difference between for example eighth or ninth place in the constructors championship is a difference of X number of millions in terms of prize money. Thats why I think Haas are going for a veteran. He further added Hulkenberg has the right look and has already proven his worth. Without test kilometers he has repeatedly jumped into the car as a test driver and in that role he has always performed. That speaks for him. But for the team the most important question will be who can lead the team stably into the future Meanwhile rumors abound in the paddock that Nico Hulkenberg could effectively be making a return to the sport next season as a Haas driver replacing Mick Schumacher.

Magnussen: “No problem" with Hulkenberg as 2023 F1 teammate, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/magnussen-no-problem-hulkenberg-2023-teammate/10395329/, The choice of Hulkenberg is intriguing because he and Magnussen who is under contract for 2023 have had their moments of controversy in the past. Most famously back at the 2017 Hungarian Grand Prix Magnussen told Hulkenberg to suck my balls after they came to verbal blows following a laterace battle for a pointsscoring position. But with Magnussen and Hulkenberg having long moved on from that moment there is unlikely to be any lingering tensions. And Magnussen himself is clear that having someone alongside him with the kind of experience that Hulkenberg has would be a positive thing. I think Ive said many times now that I dont have a problem with Nico at all said the Dane., Listen to this article Haas is currently weighing up its driver options for the second seat in 2023 with it believed to be a straight call between retaining Mick Schumacher or going for the more experienced Hulkenberg. The choice of Hulkenberg is intriguing because he and Magnussen who is under contract for 2023 have had their moments of controversy in the past.

And Magnussen himself is clear that having someone alongside him with the kind of experience that Hulkenberg has would be a positive thing. I think Ive said many times now that I dont have a problem with Nico at all said the Dane. Actually I respect him as a racing driver. I dont really know him as a person. But certainly as a racing driver Ive always respected him. So I would have no problem. But I dont have an opinion on whether or not he should be in the second car. Mick is doing a good job at the moment. He had some issues in the beginning of the year and a few crashes but he is certainly faster now. Mick Schumacher Haas VF22 Kevin Magnussen Haas VF22 Photo by Steven Tee  Motorsport Images Hulkenberg has most recently been an F1 supersub and was last called up by Aston Martin to fill in for the unwell Sebastian Vettel at the Bahrain and Saudi Arabian Grands Prix. Speculation about him moving to Haas ramped up earlier this week when it emerged that Aston had signed Stoffel Vandoorne as a reserve for 2023. Speaking to Servus TV over the Mexican GP weekend Hulkenberg said he was upbeat about the progress of talks with Haas even if nothing was finalised. At the end of the day its not my decision he said. Im not making it. There are still talks going on. Im relatively optimistic but well have to be a little patient there. Schumacher is aware that time is running out for him to impress his Haas bosses enough to convince them to keep him for 2023. But he says it is pointless getting distracted by things that he cannot control so his sole focus is on delivering crucial points. Im here to do my job and Im here to do it well he said in Mexico. So thats what my main focus is on and thats everything that Im in control of. Im just trying to do my best and thats what Im here for.

The Frenchman has been Pierre Gaslys manager for several years and will therefore also take De Vries under his wing. Previously the Dutchman did not have a manager. Article continues under ad His contract negotiations with AlphaTauri for the 2023 contract were therefore done entirely by De Vries himself. Next year as a rookie in the premier class there will be more demands on the 27yearold driver than ever so De Vries will be working with a manager for the first time. Le Goff is mainly expected to take many tasks off his hands. From now on I do have help from a management as it were. Personally I dont really like using that term because I still very much value my relationship between the team and myself. Nothing will change in that either but I do now have help from Guillaume le Goff who relieves me of everything De Vries told Jack Plooij in conversation. De Vries never felt the need for a manager because he wants to be directly connected in the team. He considers that important for personal relationships and a manager in between does not have a positive influence on that according to the upcoming AlphaTauri driver. Now however the time has come so De Vries has enlisted help from outside in the person of Le Goff. Read more Departure of De Vries and Vandoorne opens door for Ricciardo at Mercedes

Heading into the 2022 F1 Mexican GP the Silver Arrows claimed that the race was going to be the teams best opportunity to fight for a win. The race weekend did feature a competitive Mercedes but they were once again trumped by Red Bull and Max Verstappen. When asked by RacingNews365 if Mexico was the teams best opportunity to win a race the Mercedes boss admitted that was the case but also revealed that he was proud of how the team was able to compete with Red Bull. He said On the simulations it says yes this was our best chance to win this year. But we see the tendency that we are able to compete and Im really proud of the team with what we did this weekend. We experimented with a lot of things  the engine guys pushed the boundaries to really give us maximum performance so I think it will be a mix between trying to maximise this year and trying the most for next year.

Theres no reason to be overwhelmed finishing second and fourth but we have a long way to catch up. We have the winter and I think were doing some good development on the car and some of the biggest steps might be more than just adding a few points of downforce. Were giving it whatever we have and more in order to bring us back in a position to fight for a championship. Mercedes could have had a better race in Mexico In the teams 2022 F1 Mexico GP debrief video chief strategist James Vowles claimed that Mercedes could have had a better result if the team did not get boxed into changing for hard tires to maintain track position. In the video he explained We had two choices let Sergio Perez effectively undercut us but go long and then fit the Soft tyres or stop and given the length of stint the Hard would have been really the tyre that could have made it the Soft would not have made that level of stint. We decided that track position was more important at that stage and furthermore we had some data from Nicholas Latifi that had already stopped and Hard wasnt terrible. He added So we opted to stop put Lewis Hamilton on the Hard tyre and go to the end of the race under the hope that potentially Max Verstappen was going to drop off that Medium curve much as we did see degradation at the end of our stint. Many thought Mercedes could have challenged Red Bull better had the team used a different strategy. Red Bulls aggression however did appear to be the differentiating factor between the two teams.

How F1 2022's top teams have approached a key packaging dilemma, https://the-race.com/formula-1/how-f1-2022s-top-teams-have-approached-a-key-packaging-dilemma/, But looking at the Red Bull we can see the bulge in the body surface for the outer end of the lower SIPS clearly. The illustration shows the outer ends of both the upper and lower SIPS. I have highlighted with a red circle where the end of the upper SIPS should be. The lower one is between the lower surface of the underfloor and the upper surface of the underfloor and the upper one is between the inner surface of the radiator inlet duct and the upper surface of the sidepod. So it will be 2023 before we see which of these top three teams went down the right route initially., You never know how your egg is boiled until you crack open the shell and its similar with Formula 1 cars. Theres a reason for everything when it comes to packaging the thousands of parts that make up the car and things arent always as they appear before you break through the shell. The Side Impact Protection System SIPS is as the name suggests there to protect the driver in a side impact. This is mainly for accidents involving a sideon impact with a barrier or wall rather than another car although they will also be of use in that style of accident. There are two of these that must be placed in a certain position relative to the cockpit opening one low down and the other higher up. As we can clearly see on the Mercedes the upper one red arrow is entirely separate from the sidepod and used as the rearview mirror mount. The lower one blue arrow is more difficult to spot but I wouldnt be surprised if this detail on the sidepod is the outer end of it. But looking at the Red Bull we can see the bulge in the body surface for the outer end of the lower SIPS clearly. The illustration shows the outer ends of both the upper and lower SIPS. I have highlighted with a red circle where the end of the upper SIPS should be. The lower one is between the lower surface of the underfloor and the upper surface of the underfloor and the upper one is between the inner surface of the radiator inlet duct and the upper surface of the sidepod. Both are very neatly packaged between two body surfaces. On the Ferrari illustration we can only see one which is nearer to the middle of the sidepod vertically. There are no bumps or bulges for the outer ends of either top or bottom SIPS but they are inside there somewhere. Perhaps this is why the Ferrari sidepods are relatively fairly bulbous in this area Mercedes chose to have one of its SIPS cones as a standalone component Red Bull packaged these so tightly that the end of the bottom one needed a bulge while Ferrari simply enclosed them in bodywork. As I said you never know how well the egg is boiled until you crack the shell and its too late if its not to your liking by then. In the case of these three teams they didnt know what the others had come up with until the cars broke cover this season. And relocating the SIPS cones is a very difficult and expensive thing to do. Gary Andersons take on F1 tyre blanket ban amid driver backlash Read more It would require a revised chassis structure in that area to withstand the loads and also a new underfloor and sidepods. With the budget cap restricting spending all of that would just be too much. Packaging an F1 car is no easy task and we have on occasion seen problems arising from it being a bit too compact. But under normal circumstances and considering where they are located on the car wrapping things like the SIPS structures as tightly as possible has been the norm for many years. If I was looking at concepts for next year it would be a combination of the lower one from Red Bull and the upper one from Mercedes. That doesnt mean the Ferrari one isnt the best but it does look like it makes the sidepod a bit more cumbersome. So it will be 2023 before we see which of these top three teams went down the right route initially.
F1 Trivia: Why Are Formula 1 Drivers Weighed Following a Race?, https://the12thman.in/f1-trivia-why-are-formula-1-drivers-weighed-following-a-race/, Drivers are under tremendous stresses and stress over the course of a Grand Prix weekend. Why are Formula 1 drivers weighed following a raceThe driver may feel the intense heat produced by all of these systems inside the vehicle. A driver who weighed 50 kg may compete more favorably than say a driver who weighed 80 kg because the drivers weight was not taken into account in the total. This practice has been outlawed by the regulatory body since the implementation of minimum weight regulations. Formula One returns live from the Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace for the Brazilian Grand Prix the following weekend., In order to compete at the greatest level of racing in the world one must not only be skilled behind the wheel of a Formula 1 car. But also in excellent physical condition. Drivers are under tremendous stresses and stress over the course of a Grand Prix weekend. It is due to the openwheeled aspect of the sport which focuses primarily on lap time and circuit performance. The more modern vehicles that were introduced this season can be a little bit slower than the formula from the previous year. However they may still exert upwards of 5Gs of force while braking and turning. An F1 car has little to no heat protection for the driver. He is encircled by electronics an engine and a hybrid system surrounding his cockpit. It also has to withstand greater G forces than the normal person. Why are Formula 1 drivers weighed following a race The driver may feel the intense heat produced by all of these systems inside the vehicle. A driver loses 45 kg of weight in a single race due to the physical demands of driving through curves in the heat. This makes it necessary to weigh drivers before and after a race to monitor their weight loss and make sure it stays within safe legal limits. The technological requirements that an automobile must meet are another factor that depends on the weight of the driver. A minimum of 795 kg must be carried by the 2022 standard automobile including the driver. To complete technical tests after the Grand Prix the driver needs a postrace weight record. Prior to 2019 Formula 1 teams may improve performance by using a lighter driver Before the FIA mandated that a driver and his seat must weigh a minimum of 80 kg for the competition F1 teams were spotted using a lighter driver to their advantage. A driver who weighed 50 kg may compete more favorably than say a driver who weighed 80 kg because the drivers weight was not taken into account in the total. This practice has been outlawed by the regulatory body since the implementation of minimum weight regulations. It urges drivers to maintain a healthy body mass index. After a week off following the doubleheaders in the United States of America and Mexico. Formula One returns live from the Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace for the Brazilian Grand Prix the following weekend. Max Verstappen has already won the title therefore it is unclear who will take the second slot on the list. Sergio Perez and Charles Leclerc are vying for it.

OPINION: Verstappen and Red Bull don't get enough credit what they are doing is remarkable, https://racingnews365.com/opinion-verstappen-and-red-bull-dont-get-enough-credit-what-they-are-doing-is-remarkable, When Max Verstappen crossed the line at the end of the Mexican Grand Prix he did something no other driver has ever done in the history of Formula 1. It was found that Red Bull went over the 145 million budget cap for 2021 which on the face of it would suggest they gained an unfair advantage. Red Bull are the only privateer team capable of winning races in F1. Hes previously overstepped the line with his rogue marshal comments during qualifying for the 2021 Qatar Grand Prix. But hes got it right this time  Verstappen and Red Bull are unfairly being treated., When Max Verstappen crossed the line at the end of the Mexican Grand Prix he did something no other driver has ever done in the history of Formula 1. It was his 14th win in a single season surpassing the record previously held by Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel. By comparison Lewis Hamilton has only ever reached 11 wins in a season during 2014 which was matched again in 18 19 and 20. After the long period of Mercedes dominance 2022 was the time to show what Verstappen has been waiting for ever since he became F1s youngest race winner on his Red Bull debut at the Spanish Grand Prix in 2016. There were races that year which showed how ruthless he could be with the established order of drivers an example of which being the rainsoaked Brazilian Grand Prix. It was a stunning performance highlighted by the outrageous overtaking move around the outside of soontobe World Champion Nico Rosberg in the tricky conditions. At that time the talk of him being a future World Champion was ripe. So now that weve got to this point why has he suddenly become the pantomime villain  XPBimages Horner is right to point out mental health effects of cost cap saga The 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix wasnt a conventional ending for a season to say the least but Verstappen still proved his worth as a champion by winning nine other races prior to the finale. For some this championship still has an asterisk which was fuelled even more by this seasons cost cap story. It was found that Red Bull went over the 145 million budget cap for 2021 which on the face of it would suggest they gained an unfair advantage. If one examines the details the team were actually under the budget cap by 4 million and the overspend was due to a disputed amount relating to four key areas. The FIA themselves confirmed the team did not act fraudulently or in bad faith with Team Principal Christian Horner pointing out that the overspend did not amount to more performance for their car. But it didnt stop the allegations of Red Bull being branded cheaters with Horner saying the saga was having effects on the mental health of team members  and even their children. The damage that that does to the brand to our partners to our drivers to our workforce in an age where mental health is prevalent were seeing significant issues he told media including RacingNews365.com. Within our workforce we are having kids that are being bullied in playgrounds that are employees children  that is not right through fictitious allegations from other teams. The idea that Horner would gaslight members of his team to avoid criticism is abject nonsense. One has to remember that F1 teams are spending months away from their families during the everexpanding calendar in the pursuit to win races and championships. To be branded cheaters or for there to be constant digging from broadcasters at Verstappens title legitimacy is insulting to the people that are working the hours to make it happen behind the scenes. More of a concerted effort to recognise Verstappens greatness Prior to the 2021 season it was Hamilton and Mercedes who were on the receiving end of boos from the fans with Vettel and Schumacher also getting the same treatment during their years of success for simply being dominant and winning most of the races. I can remember the 2013 British Grand Prix where fans wanted anyone but Vettel to win and when he did retire in front of the grandstand I was sitting in people cheered as if Hamilton had just overtaken two cars in one corner. It is rather sad that in the very moment athletes and team personnel are achieving their lifelong ambitions  for which they have made untold sacrifices for in the pursuit of  public opinion can turn on them. Red Bull are the only privateer team capable of winning races in F1. Outside of the championship they do not really have any other income in the same way that Mercedes or Ferrari do with their car companies. If anything they are the underdogs in all this in the same way Racing Point were when they won their first race through Sergio Perez at the 2020 Sakhir Grand Prix. To an extent Red Bulls domination in 2022 is unsurprising for those that know where their strengths have always lay. Theyve always been the best chassis makers on the grid which is why neither Mercedes or Ferrari were willing to supply them with an engine when they separated from Renault during the early days of the hybrid era. That being said Horner is no angel. Hes previously overstepped the line with his rogue marshal comments during qualifying for the 2021 Qatar Grand Prix. But hes got it right this time  Verstappen and Red Bull are unfairly being treated. Verstappen will no doubt remain a perennial title contender for years to come and will continue to develop as a driver so there should be more of a concerted effort to enjoy his remarkable achievements at just 25 years old.
F1 News: Mercedes Predicts a Gloomy Outcome for the Formula One Race in Brazil Saying It Won't Be 'As Competitive ..., https://the12thman.in/f1-news-mercedes-predicts-a-gloomy-outcome-for-the-formula-one-race-in-brazil-saying-it-wont-be-as-competitive-as-mexico/, Mercedes package for the 2022 Formula One season has improved during the course of the year. Last weekends Mexican Grand Prix was a terrific day for Lewis Hamilton and George Russell.

Mercedes has been one team that has not been satisfied with its performance in the 2022 Formula One season following a period of dominance. Watch as Mercedes tries to claim the top spot on the podium in the upcoming Brazilian Grand Prix this year., Mercedes package for the 2022 Formula One season has improved during the course of the year. The Brackleybased team managed to bridge the gap or possibly exceed Ferrari despite having a slow start to the year due to porpoising. This season Red Bull Racing still appears to be the favorite coming into just about any type of circuit. But the distance between the two teams has narrowed. Last weekends Mexican Grand Prix was a terrific day for Lewis Hamilton and George Russell. He placed second and fourth respectively. At Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez both of the Mercedes vehicles were significantly faster than the Ferraris. It was with the scarlet drivers taking fifth and sixth respectively. Even though Hamilton came in 15 seconds behind Max Verstappen the Brackleybased teams struggles to make Q3 earlier in the year show that the cars progress is paying off. Mercedes predicts a gloomy outcome for the Formula One race in Brazil saying it wont be as competitive as Mexico In contrast to prior weekends the team did particularly well thanks to the high altitude of the Mexico City track. And the Mercedes W13s skill at running maximum downforce. The Toto Wolffled crew though does not appear to be as confident going into the Brazilian GP. For Mercedes a victory in the 2022 constructors championship is more desirable to Toto Wolff than P2 Silver Arrows chief strategist James Vowles commented on the causes behind it and said Although its difficult to anticipate before we arrive I dont think well be as competitive as we were last weekend. It wont be much different but a slight setback is probable. Ferrari should also be closer than it was in Mexico in my opinion. Yes the circuit is elevated above average at around 700 meters above sea level but the track configuration undoubtedly also plays a role. We perform best on tracks with significant high downforce which Brazils courses do not always have. The Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace will broadcast the 2022 Brazilian Grand Prix on November 13. Mercedes has been one team that has not been satisfied with its performance in the 2022 Formula One season following a period of dominance. The Brackleybased team appears to be striving for the top position on the podium once more while competing for P2 in the constructors title with two rounds remaining. Toto Wolff the teams chief acknowledged in media reports that he would prefer a victory this year over finishing second in the constructors standings saying A win the win would show that our car is back in the race for victories finishing P2 might also be the result of others just dropping the ball and you are getting more points the announcer said.

F1-backed female series ‘only a positive’ says W Series driver Hawkins, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/f1-female-series-positive-hawkins/10395055/, The F1backed female series would not be designed to replace W Series given it will use Formula 4 machinery and be targeted at a younger generation of drivers. W Series has used Formula 3 cars since its inaugural season in 2019. Hawkins has raced in all three seasons of W Series to date as well as serving as an ambassador for Aston Martins Formula 1 team. I also would like to think that it would work alongside W Series. W Series has helped make that happen but were just a bit later on., Listen to this article Over the United States Grand Prix weekend last month it emerged that F1 was planning to launch its own allfemale racing series as early as next year serving as a potential feeder series into Formula 3 and Formula 2. It came just weeks after W Series was forced to call off the final three rounds of its 2022 season due to fundraising issues instead turning its attention to securing back for the 2023 championship. The F1backed female series would not be designed to replace W Series given it will use Formula 4 machinery and be targeted at a younger generation of drivers. W Series has used Formula 3 cars since its inaugural season in 2019. Hawkins has raced in all three seasons of W Series to date as well as serving as an ambassador for Aston Martins Formula 1 team. Although F1 is yet to formally confirm any details for its planned series Hawkins said she can only see it as a positive as it gives more racing opportunities to women trying to get up the ladder. Any championship that helps females out I think should be welcomed and we should do everything that we can to welcome it said Hawkins. I also would like to think that it would work alongside W Series. I would hate to think they would ever be competing against each other because thats not what were fight for here. Its not whos got the best championship its how do we work together because were all trying to achieve the same thing. I think its a positive thing. Start grid Photo by Sam Bloxham  Motorsport Images Hawkins felt it was important for a greater focus on grassroots level to get more women racing helping increase the pool of drivers and had a wider impact similar to the England womens football team that won the Euro 2022 championship. The less that we have the less chance there is going to be that a female is going to be making it to Formula 1 said Hawkins. So lets address the issue get as many in as we can appeal to the younger generation get as many as we can in at grassroots level and in a few years time well see the reward of that like the Lionesses. Yes were seeing the reward of the amazing work that the current Lionesses are doing. But were actually gaining from the work that was done five 10 15 years ago. The Lionesses could have won the Euros 20 years ago but I bet no one would have heard about it. But because of the work that was done by those 20 years ago now were enjoying it and hearing about it so much. W Series has helped make that happen but were just a bit later on. Were going to see the reward of that in a few years time.

Sainz told Autosport that he would like to concentrate on the events good aspects saying Id rather concentrate on the positives because we know it was a good race for me. And finally having not raced in a month to go back in the vehicle and perform a solid race with a decent speed it was at least something nice he said.

They could only qualify in fifth and seventh place while Red Bull and Mercedes avoided contact with the opposing teams. Both Carlos Sainz and the crew were clearly having difficulties. The Spaniard said that the Scuderia was already aware of the poor speed. We are aware of the concessions we have to make for this weekend we anticipated being sluggish before the race. Instead he asserted that the speed was challenging saying Yes handling no tempo. Handling Although I was at ease and had good tyre management skills we were just too sluggish. Unfortunately in comparison to qualifying we didnt pick up any speed. Carlos Sainz placed fifth as the race began and he held that position when he crossed the finish line.

The Spaniard though is certain that his squad will be ready for the final two races of the campaign and anticipates a better outcome.

Hamilton vs Alonso: Formula 1's oldest existing rivalry, https://khelnow.com/olympic-sports/2022-10-lewis-hamilton-fernando-alonso-rivalry, Lewis Hamilton has won seven world titles while Alonso has won only twice. While the Spaniard was winning titles Lewis Hamilton was still in the GP2. Hamiltons dominance eraWith the assurance of Niki Lauda Lewis Hamilton signed for the Silver Arrow Mercedes in 2013. Alonsos F1 comeback 2021Touring the other aspects of Motorsports Alonso went for the triple crown by winning the Indy 500. While a victory is lurking in Hamilton Alonso has been a top five driver in a midfield car., Lewis Hamilton has won seven world titles while Alonso has won only twice. In what is the longest Formula 1 career of all time Fernando Alonso has rivalled some of the greatest of all. Making his debut in 2001 he rivalled the likes of Michael Schumacher Kimi Raikkonen Sebastian Vettel and Lewis Hamilton over the years. His longevity saw him racing from the Schumacher era to the Verstappen era. But of all Hamilton has been his rival for the longest time. Flashpoint 2007 Heading into 2007 Fernando Alonso had won two consecutive titles in two years. While the Spaniard was winning titles Lewis Hamilton was still in the GP2. Coming up from the McLarenMercedes setup he was signed up for 2007 by the Formula 1 side. He would be partnering with the doubledefending champion Alonso. That year McLaren was the frontrunner alongside Ferrari. Since Race 1 Hamilton went from strength to strength with Alonso. In the second race of the season McLaren secured a 12 in Malaysia with Alonso emerging as the race winner. The same happened in Monaco where the duo lapped the entire field except narrowing missing out Felipe Massa. With five podiums in five races Hamilton finally got his first race victory in the Canadian Grand Prix. In the following race United States Grand Prix he won again. With Alonso finishing behind him. Things then started getting tense in the garage. Like any other world champion Alonso didnt like getting defeated by his teammate that too rookie. In the qualifying in Hungary Alonso blocked Hamilton in the pit lane. As both the McLarens were fighting for the pole Alonso stalled him just for enough time that Lewis didnt get the final run. However despite getting the pole Alonso was demoted by 5place and Hamilton got the pole. He eventually won the race. They fought furiously and vied for the title producing numeral moments to look back to. However Kimi Rikknen stole it from both of them and won the title in the race by one point. At the end of the season Alonso left McLarenMercedes and went back to Renault. Hamilton stayed on. In 2008 he edged Massa by one point in the last lap and won his first of many championship titles. While Alonso remained sixth in an incompetent Renault. 20102013 Different cars toptier Fernando The duo didnt get to rival each other on a frequent basis since then. Moving to Ferrari in 2010 Alonso finally had another chance to put himself up for the title fight. The 251815 points format was introduced that year. Despite that only 16 points separated the top four. The race went down to the last lap and Vettel won his first championship. Alonso ended up four points too short. While Hamilton completed the season with 240 points 12 behind Alonso. Alonso once again failed to touch the title in 2012 when Vettel just ended up three points ahead of him. Alonso finally moved on to McLaren in 2015. But his stint at Ferrari goes down in history. What makes it the most magical is that Ferrari wasnt supposed to be that high. Despite McLaren being a much more competitive car Alonso defeated Hamilton every single year from 2010 to 2013. However the bigger picture for the Spaniard was Vettel not him. Hamiltons dominance era With the assurance of Niki Lauda Lewis Hamilton signed for the Silver Arrow Mercedes in 2013. There has been no stopping the Brit since then. But on the other side things got opposite and terribly downhill for Alonso. He went back to McLaren in 2015. While Hamilton was making record after record Alonso could not catch a break from his troubles at McLaren. He eventually retired from Formula 1 in 2018. Brimming with sportsmanship Hamilton and Vettel celebrated Alonsos spectacular career with a donut show in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Producing one of the most wholesome photographs of all time. Alonsos F1 comeback 2021 Touring the other aspects of Motorsports Alonso went for the triple crown by winning the Indy 500. However his engine said no. He made a comeback to Formula 1 in 2021. Renault was rebranded as Alpine that year. Alonso replaced the outgoing Daniel Ricciardo. This was the year Red Bull was finally ready to put Verstappen in the title fight. While he and Hamilton fought for the title Alonso weaved his magic in instances. The most famous of which came at the Hungaroring when he held off his eternal rival for around 10 laps to give his teammate Esteban Ocon his firstever F1 win. In a dramatic Hungary GP Hamilton was on course to win the race. After a weird turn of events it was somehow Ocon who was the frontrunner. But given the sheer pace of Mercedes Hamilton had a clear run to win the race. But Alonso defended with all his might and Hamilton remained around 2.74 seconds short of the victory. The duo still battle it out on track. While a victory is lurking in Hamilton Alonso has been a top five driver in a midfield car. Mercedes woes have motivated Hamilton even more while Alonso has signed a multiyear deal with Aston Martin. Being 37 and 41 respectively both Hamilton and Alonso are set to commit to a few more years of Formula 1 racing.

Grosjean Says Verstappen Has Changed To 'Stay More Within The Limits', https://wtf1.com/post/grosjean-says-verstappen-has-changed-to-stay-more-within-the-limits/, Where Verstappen has been criticised in the past is for his aggressive driving style and this was placed firmly under the spotlight during his seasonlong battle with Lewis Hamilton for the 2021 title. While recovering from a poor pitstop and following Kimi Raikkonen through the field the flying Dutchman came across the back of Grosjean. Nowadays Grosjean holds no grudges about the incident instead hailing the quite extraordinary pace Verstappen has set since joining the grid. And while Grosjean was able to largely shake off that reputation over his time in F1 hes caused a stir at times during his second year in IndyCar this year. Has Verstappens driving changed or is he just in dire need of more competition in 2023, Max Verstappen has looked unstoppable this year. The fiery Dutchman has always been fast but hes now fully realising his potential dominating races and breaking records left right and centre with the help of Red Bulls RB18. Where Verstappen has been criticised in the past is for his aggressive driving style and this was placed firmly under the spotlight during his seasonlong battle with Lewis Hamilton for the 2021 title. Any fan that watched last year or has witnessed the Twitter fallout since will be able to tell you that the pair constantly clashed with Verstappens uncompromising style contributing depending on who you ask to a Saudi Arabian shunt and big crashes at Monza and Silverstone. However speaking earlier this week on Skys Any Driven Monday F1 veteran Romain Grosjean suggested that the 25yearold has become calmer this season and doesnt push the limits as much as he did. Since his world championship hes gotten more at peace explained Grosjean. He drives the way he does which is a very engaged way of driving which I love. But he just stays more within the limits than he would have done in the past. In his Lotus Renault days the Frenchman actually had a runin with Verstappen himself at the 2015 Monaco Grand Prix during Verstappens rookie F1 season. While recovering from a poor pitstop and following Kimi Raikkonen through the field the flying Dutchman came across the back of Grosjean. When he tried to overtake him into Turn 1 Verstappen caused a huge crash hitting the Lotus rear and spearing into the barriers. Nowadays Grosjean holds no grudges about the incident instead hailing the quite extraordinary pace Verstappen has set since joining the grid. But in terms of style the nowIndyCar driver said F1s twotime world champion has learned and adapted. Max wouldnt do that today. Thats something Max has learned and its normal said Grosjean. Max had a very fast career through the singleseaters he came into Formula 1 super early. But you can have all the preparation you want Formula 1 is different. Of course Grosjean is one of the drivers best placed to talk about this topic having been no stranger to receiving criticism for his racing style. He came under fire during his fulltime rookie F1 season in 2012 where he received a race ban for some quite frankly dangerous driving including causing a major opening lap shunt at the 2012 Belgian GP. And while Grosjean was able to largely shake off that reputation over his time in F1 hes caused a stir at times during his second year in IndyCar this year. Ferraris Carlos Sainz said he wants to make things more complicated for the Dutchman in 2023. If F1s Smooth Operator can manage this and if Ferrari can deliver the car for Charles Leclerc and him then maybe then well know just how much Verstappen has changed  especially if Mercedes can rejoin the fight too Has Verstappens driving changed or is he just in dire need of more competition in 2023

Norris Eyeing Up Future Opportunities to Race Outside F1, https://wtf1.com/post/norris-eyeing-up-future-opportunities-to-race-outside-f1/, Lando Norris has been a man in demand in 2022. On that occasion Norris hopes of longdistance racing glory went up in smoke as his LMP2 race car suffered mechanical issues. However the young Brit has now suggested that this experience has whetted his appetite to sample more racing outside of F1. I would love to drive more I would love to get more opportunities Norris told Racer. Would you like to see F1 drivers dabble in other racing series offseason, Lando Norris has been a man in demand in 2022. Not only has he raised his stock by outperforming teammate Daniel Ricciardo in another impressive F1 campaign but the Brit revealed this week that he had spoken to Red Bull before resigning for McLaren. Agreed earlier this year the renewal is set to keep Lando in a papaya race suit until 2025 but it appears that hes already got his eyes peeled for chances to compete elsewhere in the years to come. In 2018 the McLaren man took part in the 24 Hours of Daytona with fellow F1 star Fernando Alonso and veteran endurance racer Phil Hanson for Zak Browns United Autosports team. On that occasion Norris hopes of longdistance racing glory went up in smoke as his LMP2 race car suffered mechanical issues. However the young Brit has now suggested that this experience has whetted his appetite to sample more racing outside of F1. I would love to drive more I would love to get more opportunities Norris told Racer. Formula 1 is my life at the minute I understand that. But doing the Daytona 24 hours and things like that I would love to do and Im sure in maybe 10 or 20 years I will have that opportunity or more opportunities to do it. Given that F1s new record 24race calendar is set to put the endurance of Lando and all his fellow drivers to the test next year he says downtime will be at a premium. Understandably when he does get a break the 22yearold expects hell just want to go away and forget about Formula 1 before coming back to it and he doesnt plan on racing in other series alongside F1. On the other hand with McLaren venturing into series like IndyCar and his teammate recently getting to demo a NASCAR he says he has started thinking about other vehicles hed like to drive. He Ricciardo got to drive the number three Dale Earnhardt car I dont really have anyone Ive looked up to like Daniel and Earnhardt he added. Maybe Ill try a motorbike but I probably wouldnt be able to come back to four wheels if I went motorbiking because Id crash For the time being Lando says hes committed to F1. That said hes got plenty of time left in his career to try out other categories. Maybe MotoGP should be off the cards though.  Would you like to see F1 drivers dabble in other racing series offseason
Formula 1 may be getting a new winter break period, https://sixsports.in/formula-1-may-be-getting-a-new-winter-break-period/, A summer break is already present in Formula 1 taking into account the long and tiring seasons. Now however another break period is also recommended. Formula Ones Sporting Advisory Committee is believed to be discussing another break period during the winters after the end of the season. The rules of the winter break are expected to be similar to summer break. But there was a positive indication for the wellbeing of the people.The new winter break could very well be the answer to the negative impacts of a very long F1 season., Formula 1 can be tedious at times and the upcoming season will only increase the workload on everyone involved. A summer break is already present in Formula 1 taking into account the long and tiring seasons. All factories are shut down during the period. This ensures that every team and its staff get welldeserved time off. Further the sport is going to witness its longest season ever in 2023 with recordbreaking 24 races. Now however another break period is also recommended. Formula Ones Sporting Advisory Committee is believed to be discussing another break period during the winters after the end of the season. The rules of the winter break are expected to be similar to summer break. It is most likely to commence around the Christmas and New year weeks. However the talks are yet to reach the advanced stage and it is believed that not all the teams have agreed on it yet. Mercedes Formula 1 Team boss Toto Wolff has provided some insight into the development of this proposal. He is optimistic and welcoming to the new change and hopes every team agrees on it. There are many of us team principals that would like to replicate what we have in the summer at least starting at Christmas and going into the new year for two weeks. Wolff added Obviously thats still up for discussion. But there was a positive indication for the wellbeing of the people. The new winter break could very well be the answer to the negative impacts of a very long F1 season. The 24race calendar can become boring for not only the drivers but for the team as a whole.

The one F1 record Verstappen will not be able to break in 2022, https://racingnews365.com/the-one-f1-record-verstappen-will-not-be-able-to-break-in-2022, With 14 Formula 1 Grand Prix wins and counting in the 2022 season Max Verstappen is in uncharted territory. However while this record is certainly attainable there is one that Verstappen will not be able to claim  no matter what he does. The record Verstappen cant break With the F1 calendar expanding in recent years the total number of race wins in a season has become an easier target. However Ascaris score is set to remain unbeatable to have beaten his tally Verstappen would have needed 17 wins from the season. In the first 10 seasons of the World Championship F1 drivers didnt bother with a trip to Indiana but in 1952 Ascari did just that with Ferrari., With 14 Formula 1 Grand Prix wins and counting in the 2022 season Max Verstappen is in uncharted territory. His win in the Mexican Grand Prix eclipsed the tally of 13 victories  the record jointly held by Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel  as the Red Bull driver continued to impose his dominance on the campaign. He can potentially claim the largest margin between P1 and P2 in the Drivers Championship with his gap to Sergio Perez currently standing at 136 points. The alltime record is 155 points held by Vettel in his 2013 campaign over Fernando Alonso meaning that Verstappen needs to outscore Perez by 20 points in the final two race weekends. However while this record is certainly attainable there is one that Verstappen will not be able to claim  no matter what he does. The record Verstappen cant break With the F1 calendar expanding in recent years the total number of race wins in a season has become an easier target. Mick Schumacher even said after Mexico that he expected his fathers record to be beaten given the fact that there are more races these days than compared to Michaels era. With that in mind the metric of total percentage wins in a season has become more useful to measure a drivers success. However despite winning 14 of 20 races in 2022 and potentially even 16 of 22 Verstappen will fall short of taking a record that has stood since 1952  the third year of the World Championship  as the table below shows. Highest driver win percentages Year Driver Races Wins Percentage wins 1952 Alberto Ascari 8 6 75 2004 Michael Schumacher 18 13 72.22 1963 Jim Clark 10 7 70 2022 Max Verstappen 20 14  up to Mexican GP 70 2013 Sebastian Vettel 19 13 68.42 1954 Juan Manuel Fangio 9 6 66.67 2002 Michael Schumahcer 17 11 64.71 2020 Lewis Hamilton 17 11 64.71 Verstappens tally As it stands with 14 wins from 20 races Verstappen has a 70 win rate. Should he take victories in Brazil and Abu Dhabi for a score of 16 from 22 this will climb to 72.72  and move him into second on the list behind Alberto Ascaris record of 75 from 1952. However Ascaris score is set to remain unbeatable to have beaten his tally Verstappen would have needed 17 wins from the season. Ascaris record is also unique as he also competed in the Indy 500 that year. In the first 10 seasons of the World Championship F1 drivers didnt bother with a trip to Indiana but in 1952 Ascari did just that with Ferrari. As a result he missed the seasonopener in May 1952 in Switzerland before finishing 31st in the 500 itself. Upon returning to the F1 scene he would not be beaten across the rest of the season winning all six races from the Belgian Grand Prix.

He comes in and slots in he knows what to expect. And from my side Ive just tried to be as welcoming and include him  trying to communicate a lot about the car what can I test what can you test to get us to point A I just try to work with him as I did with Valtteri Bottas. When you add new people it takes time to all get into the rhythm but I think hes done an amazing job we got into a decent rhythm quite early on and were continuing to work out any kinks there to continue to be on that rhythm. Hamilton has vowed to return to the title fight in 2023 and challenge Max Verstappen again.

Ferrari: Mercedes’ development rate not a worry for F1 2023, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/ferrari-mercedes-development-rate-not-a-worry-for-f1-2023/10395092/, While the Italian squad started the 2022 season as the team to beat it eventually lost out to the fastrecovering Red Bull team which has claimed both the drivers and constructors championship titles. More recently Mercedes has emerged as Red Bulls main threat at some races with Ferraris F175 particularly lacking performance last time out in Mexico. That could leave Ferrari facing another season of disappointment having failed to capitalise on having the best package at the start of this year. We know as well ourselves that we stopped quite early the development of that car to focus on 2023. Since then Red Bull has won every grand prix., While the Italian squad started the 2022 season as the team to beat it eventually lost out to the fastrecovering Red Bull team which has claimed both the drivers and constructors championship titles. More recently Mercedes has emerged as Red Bulls main threat at some races with Ferraris F175 particularly lacking performance last time out in Mexico. This has come with Mercedes overcoming the early bouncing problems that plagued its W13 and being able to finally unlock the potential it knew was always in the car. Mercedes progress points to the team being back in contention for wins next year as it looks poised to switch some key concepts of its challenger. That could leave Ferrari facing another season of disappointment having failed to capitalise on having the best package at the start of this year. But Ferrari team principal Binotto thinks the current competitive picture between his outfit and Mercedes does not reflect the true situation for next year as Maranello switched off development of its 2022 car early to shift its focus to next year. Mercedes is coming back right as they have developed the car more than we did he said after Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc finished fifth and sixth in Mexico. We know as well ourselves that we stopped quite early the development of that car to focus on 2023. So Im not too concerned by the rate of development because I know as well when we stopped developing it. Ferrari has not won a race since the Austrian Grand Prix in July when Leclerc came through to beat Max Verstappen. Since then Red Bull has won every grand prix.

Certainly if I look at the last races it has not always been great but in Singapore I think we have been very competitive he said. Japan was in the wet and we were not as fast but it was not a drama and certainly not in the quali. In the States Austin I think that in the quali we were competitive but not as much as we would have expected in the race. In Mexico its a lot worse but I dont think its the same trend because Singapore competitive Japan not too bad USA good quali. But the duty is first to try to analyse whats going on and what has been the main issues here in Mexico and try to be back competitive for what is our level of competitiveness at least for the last two races including Sao Paulo. So we hope certainly to be there and to fight for a better result.
‘There’s no limit to what we can do’ – Hamilton on fighting back ‘best friend’ Wolff and changing the world, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.theres-no-limit-to-what-we-can-do-hamilton-on-fighting-back-best-friend.6G5Be1bYJ4AzCkYAmrv0BH.html, I cant tell you what that is just yet but there is no limit to what we can do. I get to be myself at this team  and the support from Mercedes has been incredible since day one. Toto Wolff Mercedes Team Principal is one of my best friends. Its with that in mind Hamilton is focusing on all the details he can control  and working with the team to drive them forward. Hamilton remains as motivated as ever to claim what would be a recordbreaking eighth world title, Lewis Hamilton is a force of nature. The Briton has had the most challenging 12 months of his career a period which began with missing out on what would have been a record eighth world title on the final lap of the final race of 2021 and could end with him enduring the first winless campaign of his illustrious career. And yet he is not letting it get him down. Rather than pondering an exit and calling it quits the losses are only serving to reenergise him as he considers the next chapter. READ MORE Hamilton targeting multiyear contract renewal with Mercedes In terms of my physical wellbeing I feel the best Ive physically ever been because Ive been really focused on that as you get older says Hamilton when we sit down before lunch in the Mercedes motorhome. Im generally loving driving so Im working on a plan. I cant tell you what that is just yet but there is no limit to what we can do. I want to be creative and continue to do all the other things I get to do. I get to be myself at this team  and the support from Mercedes has been incredible since day one. Together its not just about winning we can be part of the many people in the world that are trying to change the world for the better  and thats what we can try and do together as its a huge brand that can have a huge influence on the world. Hamilton is determined to leave his mark on and off the track Given Hamilton is in his happy place with Mercedes its no surprise he is in talks to extend his stay at the Silver Arrows with a multiyear deal. The 37yearold is currently in his 10th season with the Mercedes works team and 16th in total in F1 as the German manufacturer supplied power to Hamiltons first team McLaren. Extending given they give him so much freedom  from what he wears to what he does away from the track  and support particularly on causes that hes keen to use his platform to give a voice to makes sense. READ MORE We know where we need to improve says Hamilton after P2 in Mexico He also gets on well with the boss too. Toto Wolff Mercedes Team Principal is one of my best friends. Weve had tough tough times weve had tough negotiations theres been emotional bursts a rollercoaster of emotions together over the years but were like family. I want whats best for him. He wants what is best for me. We always can jump on the phone and talk about whatever that is. Our values are aligned and our goals are aligned  in the brand in helping this team grow and what it wants to achieve. Hamilton has formed a close relationship with Wolff over the years Hamilton has quickly formed a strong partnership with his team mate George Russell a Mercedes junior who earned promotion after three years at Williams including a super sub performance for Hamilton at Mercedes in Bahrain back in 2020. It could have been awkward the young pretender coming in alongside the veteran one year after his run of utter domination came to an end courtesy of Max Verstappen and Red Bull. But instead faced with the least competitive Silver Arrows car Brackley and Brixworth have produced since the hybrid turbo era began they have worked together for the greater good  with Hamilton playing an active role helping his fellow Briton hit the ground running. In terms of George joining he was one of the younger drivers here  he would sit behind in debriefs and engineering so he knows the process and the lay of the land here says Hamilton. READ MORE In hindsight its always easier  Wolff defends Mercedes Mexico strategy as wait for 2022 win goes on He comes in and slots in he knows what to expect. And from my side Ive just tried to be as welcoming and include him  trying to communicate a lot about the car what can I test what can you test to get us to point A I just try to work with him as I did with Valtteri. When you add new people it takes time to all get into the rhythm but I think hes done an amazing job we got into a decent rhythm quite early on and were continuing to work out any kinks there to continue to be on that rhythm. Hamilton and Russell have combined to score 15 podiums so far this season despite Mercedes struggles The longer Hamilton has been in F1 the more hes found stuff to do away from the sport  from setting up his own foundation Mission 44 to help young people from underrepresented background to becoming a coowner for NFL team Denver Broncos. But rather than taking his eye off the main prize in trying to achieve the balance hes actively enhanced his approach to tackling a race weekend at track to ensure the day job doesnt suffer and remains top priority. I shifted my weekend rhythm from years ago he says. These four days Thursday through to race day on Sunday Im only here for one reason. Thats not how you speak in the media or its not how youre seen but its how you show up its the work youre doing on track how youre driving on the track how you get the car to be the best it can be and how you can be the best you can be. PALMER Could Mercedes have beaten Verstappen in Mexico City with bolder calls from the pit wall So I try to use up all the time and the quietest part of the day particularly is the end of the day as no one is around and thats where I have no distractions. I can go through the data  and Im in constant contact with the simulation team back at the factory so while that is running Im able to have live interactions with the driver who is driving there. Hamilton and Mercedes are still pushing for their first win of 2022 having come close in the United States and Mexico I eat at the track and then Im depleted once I finish. Im starting to wind down at the end head back to the hotel and then its a short time between going to sleep and waking up  so thats what I like. I dont want to finish here early and go to dinner. I have no desire to go to dinner and waste time yapping. Im here for one reason thats to win races. That dinner and other events not linked to racing during a race weekend for me is all the distraction so I dont do that very often  if ever. To win races though Mercedes will need to turn things around for next year after a difficult season that has left the Silver Arrows trailing Red Bull and Ferrari by quite some way. TREMAYNE Mercedes resurgence means we could be in for a thrilling end to 2022 Positively for Hamilton and co they have closed the gap in recent races  pulling themselves into the fight for victory at both Austin and Mexico  but the seventime world champion knows they still have plenty to do if they are to recapture the form that led to Mercedes dominating F1 from 2014 to 2020. Its with that in mind Hamilton is focusing on all the details he can control  and working with the team to drive them forward. Hamilton remains as motivated as ever to claim what would be a recordbreaking eighth world title

Ricciardo reveals help from psychologist - “I was neglecting friendships”, https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1016199/1/ricciardo-reveals-help-psychologist-i-was-neglecting-friendships, The veteran Australian has now revealed how his ontrack struggles followed him in his personal life too.  F1 2022 Video of Daniel Ricciardo  WHERE NEXT  F1 2022Whenever we thought we would found a solution along would come another set of challenges he told the Daily Mail. I was neglecting friendships and thought it would be good to talk to someone to make sure the two sides of my life didnt cross over. It would be good to get next year sorted before the final race in Abu Dhabi he said., Ricciardo wont be in the F1 2023 driver lineup after McLaren opted to terminate his contract a year early and replace him with rookie Oscar Piastri as a result of his poor form. The veteran Australian has now revealed how his ontrack struggles followed him in his personal life too. Daniel Ricciardo  WHERE NEXT  F1 2022 Video of Daniel Ricciardo  WHERE NEXT  F1 2022 Whenever we thought we would found a solution along would come another set of challenges he told the Daily Mail. When you put so much into something and it doesnt work out there is sadness. It gets to you. Last year it affected me a little bit too much. I wouldnt be my usual bubbly self. I would be reluctant if someone said lets go out for dinner. I would need some cajoling. I let it get to me. I started to speak to a psychologist last year. The most challenging year I have had. Racing is very much results driven and dictates your Sunday happiness. I was neglecting friendships and thought it would be good to talk to someone to make sure the two sides of my life didnt cross over. You need perspective. And with the calendar being so long it was hard to remove yourself from what was happening in the racing. Ricciardo is 12th in the F1 standings after being drastically outperformed by Lando Norris in 2022. McLaren opted not to keep him for 2023 and he has not found an agreement to stay on the grid with another team. It is fair to say it was unexpected given I was on a threeyear deal that had a year to run he said about McLarens decision. It is not something you can prepare for. But Id already had some honest discussions with Andreas Seidl team principal and Zak Brown chief executive earlier in the year to see what we could do to improve things. It was a concern on both sides. I didnt want to keep coming 14th or 15th. I kept the faith that something would click. But it hadnt happened by midseason and they took the decision they did. It put me in a tough position of thinking What next Ricciardo has confirmed that he remains in talks with F1 teams about a different role reportedly as a reserve driver. He has been heavily linked with Mercedes as backup to Lewis Hamilton and George Russell. It would be good to get next year sorted before the final race in Abu Dhabi he said.

The seat became available after Alonso elected to make a switch to Aston Martin with Oscar Piastri set to be his replacement. However following a lengthy contract dispute Piastri will now race with rivals McLaren which meant a seat had been available at the team.

But who knows you know everything happens for a reason maybe now Ill be more ready than ever when that time comes. Its good to know that I do have the support from the team to know that I can be branched out if that werent the case and if the opportunity came available.
Lewis Hamilton snubbed again as Sebastian Vettel changes his mind on F1 GOAT debate, https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/f1-goat-hamilton-schumacher-vettel-28414447, Michael is my hero for that reason I probably dont want Lewis to win he said last December. In a way I would be happy if Michaels record still stands but even if Lewis wins to me Michael is still the greatest. Lewis can win one more two more three more five more championships  it doesnt change anything for me. Asked again for his verdict on that most controversial of questions Vettel now believes the GOAT to be fivetime champion Juan Manuel Fangio. Im a fan of Michael Schumacher but Fangio is a little better... the best the best the king said Vettel., Vettel previously named Michael Schumacher as the best F1 driver of all time in his opinion but it seems he has since changed his mind while still ignoring Hamilton Sebastian Vettel has changed his mind on who he believes to be the Formula 1 GOAT  but like last time he avoided choosing Lewis Hamilton. The fourtime world champion knows more than most what it takes to be among the F1 elite. Vettel will retire later this month as one of the most decorated racers the sport has ever seen boasting 53 race wins and 112 podiums as well as those four consecutive drivers titles. Last year on the eve of the titledeciding Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Vettel made it clear who he believed to be the greatest driver the sport has ever seen. No matter whether or not Hamilton got the better of Max Verstappen last year he still advocated for his countryman Michael Schumacher. Michael is my hero for that reason I probably dont want Lewis to win he said last December. But the truth is they both had a strong season and they are going into the last race with the opportunity to win the championship because they both deserve it. In a way I would be happy if Michaels record still stands but even if Lewis wins to me Michael is still the greatest. Lewis can win one more two more three more five more championships  it doesnt change anything for me. Those comments made clear his unwavering belief in that point of view but it seems something may have changed over the last 12 months. Asked again for his verdict on that most controversial of questions Vettel now believes the GOAT to be fivetime champion Juan Manuel Fangio. Image Mirrorpix Mirrorpix The Argentine competed in a vastly different era of the sport winning 24 races in 51 starts on the way to five world championships in the 1950s. Im a fan of Michael Schumacher but Fangio is a little better... the best the best the king said Vettel. The German also went on to give his verdict on Verstappen who may well enter the GOAT debate one day after romping to 2022 title  the second of his career  aged 25. I think hes had a hell of a season so hopefully he goes on and get 16 wins by the end of the year because anything else will be a disappointment Vettel added. It is great for Red Bull and I still know some people there so I am really happy for them. Obviously they have a lot of momentum from last year and the car this year is incredible. They won races even though they were heavier than anybody else and I think now theyve finally got the weight out. So the car is there but Max is doing an amazing job as well.

failed yet fruitful Alpine F1 seat pitch that began on Instagram, https://the-race.com/formula-1/the-failed-yet-fruitful-alpine-2023-pitch-that-began-on-instagram/, Jack Doohan has not managed to get an Alpine Formula 1 drive for 2023. And while Alpine has unsurprisingly gone for a more experienced option for its 2023 race seat in Pierre Gasly Doohans efforts have still been worthwhile. So I actually sent him a DM on Instagram  basically this huge big long paragraph saying why I think I could be a candidate going forward. He took his first feature race win at Spa  which was the sort of message ontrack that he was telegraphing to Alpine offtrack. At that point in time ninth in Formula 2 and not really in a position to go to Formula 1., Jack Doohan has not managed to get an Alpine Formula 1 drive for 2023. But its not for the lack of trying. F1s newest free practice debutant is now frontandcentre in Alpines junior programme following the messy Oscar Piastri saga. Doohan had more nerves chasing Alpine seat than FP1 debut Read more That might have seemed like a natural progression given he was the highestplaced Alpine protege in the junior ranks when it became clear Piastri would be leaving the team but whatever it owes to circumstance it owes an equal amount to Doohans impressive proactivity. From sending Alpine CEO Laurent Rossi direct messages on social media to emailing Alpines lead engineer on the first weekend after the summer break Doohan did all he could to shape his own destiny. And while Alpine has unsurprisingly gone for a more experienced option for its 2023 race seat in Pierre Gasly Doohans efforts have still been worthwhile. On the night that all that news broke I didnt have Laurents number or anything Doohan says. So I actually sent him a DM on Instagram  basically this huge big long paragraph saying why I think I could be a candidate going forward. And he replied at like 3am  I think he was in the US or somewhere  with his number at the bottom and that wed chat in the coming days. Then I think I spoke to Otmar Szafnauer the following night briefly. And every day I was kind of trying to speak to whoever I can in all parts of the Formula 1 team and all parts of the structure for the Academy. It was an opportunity and even if it was a farfetched one at least now with the seat closed off and Pierre taking it I know that Im not sitting here going I wish I pushed a little bit more I wish I tried. Alonsos 2022 misery has a silver lining  but not for him Read more For a solid six weeks I was doing absolutely everything I can to try and secure myself in the seat. Sure it didnt work out as hoped. But it had its upsides. Doohan was only ninth in Formula 2 heading into F1s summer break. He took his first feature race win at Spa  which was the sort of message ontrack that he was telegraphing to Alpine offtrack. If hed been off Alpines radar before August the team quickly discovered how serious Doohan was. It has been impressed by how he conducted himself and the way he behaved certainly didnt hurt his chances of replacing Piastri in the Friday practice sessions Alpine had lined up for its reserve driver. In Doohans words good things came out of it. After making his pitch to Alpines most senior figures he sought to embed himself in the team more which also aided his Formula 2 campaign. It had flickered into life just before the summer break but has enjoyed a sustained improvement since everything kicked off at Alpine at the start of August even if some circumstances have stopped Doohan from turning that into as many points as he should have. Whats going on with Piastris Alpine F1 exit Read more From the moment it all happened I was pushing on every aspect that I could to try and secure a position in Formula 1 Doohan says. And as we got to Spa I was speaking with the team as well. At that point in time ninth in Formula 2 and not really in a position to go to Formula 1. And the guys were saying its probably highly unlikely well focus on Formula 2. On Friday morning at Spa I emailed the chief engineer Ciaron Pilbeam and I said do you mind if I sit in on the preFP1 briefing And he said yeah for sure. I started from there kind of embedding myself more into the team and really trying to understand how the weekend falls into place and and basically trying to take in as much information as I can. Honestly I think when I was coming back to Formula 2 things were just so much more simple. The information coming from engineer to driver and everything that I was taking in was so much less. I think that was helping me as well. I saw that I had an opportunity to go to Formula 1. So I was going if I just enjoy this and it happens I do have a chance here. Whereas before I was obviously behind Oscar and it was maybe looking more like a twoyear project. Why Alpine thinks Gaslys a better fit than Alonso or Piastri Read more It still might be in the sense Doohan is heading for a second year in Formula 2. But if thats the case it will be with the knowledge he is at the front of the Alpine queue having made a real impression on the people in charge and has developed into a driver who will start 2023 as the title favourite. From how he conducted himself during the peak of the Piastri saga to his preparation for his FP1 debut in Mexico and his general offtrack attitude Doohans earned plenty of plaudits internally at Alpine. Team principal Otmar Szafnauer says Doohans preparation was exemplary going in wanting to know everything before Mexico and sporting director Alan Permane reckons Doohans character might prove to be an ace up the sleeve. What impresses me most about Jack honestly is out of the car says Permane. His preparation the work he does behind the scenes. Hed never driven here and there hadnt been a plan for him to drive here. And a few weeks ago he was in Brisbane doing some F2 sponsor commitments and we told him he was going to be driving in Mexico. He flew back to the UK did a day in the sim and then came onwards to Austin and here. So thats what impresses me most  his preparation. Theres no doubt about his speed. When he makes it to Formula 1 thatll be a nice differentiator for him.

It was brought in at the Spanish Grand Prix the fifth race of the 2003 season. Chassis 229 is by far the most successful of the six F2003GAs that were built. Schumacher drove it to victory in Spain and also won the Austrian Canadian Italian and US Grands Prix in the car. He also claimed pole position in Spain Austria and Italy in the car and the fastest laps in Austria Italy and the United States. The car powered Schumacher to his sixth F1 title  a total that saw the German overtake the five won by Argentinas Juan Manuel Fangio in the 1950s.

Like millions of new F1 fans Sam and I started watching Netflixs Drive to Survive in early lockdowns., You will hear a Formula 1 car before you see it. You will feel it before you see it. Theres almost a sense of foreshadowing of air being sucked back down the track. The highpitched scream rises eats into your eardrums until suddenly in a visceral release it rockets past. Neeeuuummm Instantly its gone again like a fighter jet on rails. F1 cars are so fast so low to the ground the drivers head is at roughly hip height its breathtaking. If a couple race past together a drivers exhaust sparks or someone locks up the brakes the whiff of fuel and rubber follows on a trailing wind. Its sport Jim but not as Ive known it.

But walking into Italys fabled Monza circuit with my 12yearold son Sam the reality blows that away. We first hear the roars outside the park. As we move closer to our stand in a sea of Ferrari Red and Red Bull blue the noise swells. Practice is underway a helicopter flies overhead and the cars are milling around the Autodromo Nazionale Monza at up to 347kmh. Stepping through the gigantic steel bleachers we see the track on the other side of a fence  astonishingly what feels like a few metres away. A F1 car flies by with such volume and pace I wince and take a step back. Theres another. And another. Then an extra energy ripples through the crowd. A bright red car approaches. Its Charles Leclercs Ferrari and fans go ballistic. He thunders past the tifosi and they react like football supporters whose team has scored a matchwinning goal. And this is just a practice session.

The autodromo threads through one of Europes largest parks lots of walking is involved and its surrounded not just by grandstands but a fanzone DJs and stalls selling food drink and walletbusting merch an official baseball cap costs 60 a hoodie 180. The main event is of course Sundays race but Grands Prix stretch over three or four days including free practice sessions a qualifying hour that decides the grid starting order and a host of other races vintage car parades and sideshows in between. Its a fun friendly vibe with far more kids families and women than youd find at say a Premier League match. And the waves of red around leave little doubt that most are shouting for Ferrari. Our trip began when we couldnt travel at all. Like millions of new F1 fans Sam and I started watching Netflixs Drive to Survive in early lockdowns. When the 2020 season kicked off under empty stands we bought a sports TV subscription to watch it. The strategy the speed the crashes the characters the rivalries  we were hooked and our interest has only grown over the two seasons since. Expand Close Sam among the home crowd  Facebook Twitter Email Whatsapp Sam among the home crowd Were not alone. Around us in Monza I hear a surprising amount of Irish accents and see a couple of GAA jerseys. The epic 2021 rivalry between Red Bulls Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes which controversially came down to the last lap amped up the drama. Young fans have found young drivers like Leclerc Lando Norris and Mick Schumacher relatable. Theyre on TikTok and Insta. F1s popularity is catching fire in the lucrative US market with tickets for a new Las Vegas Grand Prix including The Strip next year starting from 500. Suddenly it seems everyone wants a piece of this sport. Of course F1 can be boring too. Theyre just going around in circles Sams sister sometimes chides. Shes right... technically. Its also true that sustainability sportswashing there are races in Saudi Arabia and Qatar for example and rule confusion threaten its credibility. But we also see scintillating speed strategy and skill within those circles. Variables like weather pit stops tyres and track differences throw up unknowns. There are only 20 drivers and they speak their minds in interviews or fits of passion or pique on team radios. Its all served up with the awesome immersiveness of modern TV. And now were in the middle of it in Monzas Temple of Speed. Its so loud Sam grins despite wearing ear plugs and overear headphones. Through it all fans mingle with hardly any agro and punters range from hardcore fans on the embankments or even climbing trees to VIP guests paying thousands for pitlane access and paddock tours.

Saturdays qualifying run is a highlight. Our seats are on the Laterale Parabolica a famous corner amidst waves of Ferrari red interspersed with the Orange Army of Dutch Verstappen fans. In the dying moments of the session Leclerc posts a scorching lap time that puts him on provisional pole. The crowd erupts. When Verstappen fails to nail a faster lap the cheers are even louder. The track is 5.79km long so we only get to see a sliver of the realtime action but big screens relay whats happening elsewhere. Its a super sporting spectacle. Im not surprised to learn sports travel packages are on the rise. Cassidy Travel with whom we travelled has already released its F1 packages for 2023 spokesperson John Spollen says they are popular as Christmas gifts and not just for petrol heads anymore. But anyone considering a Grand Prix trip needs to think about travel times the costs of food drink and transport in different destinations and factors like how familyfriendly different track layouts are what kind of walking and transfers are involved and the views your money buys in grandstands or general admission. Street circuits offer different experiences to parkland tracks for example. Venues range from Singapore to Silverstone Melbourne to Monaco. Unfortunately the experience outside of Monzas track and stands is disappointing. There are long frustrating queues for portaloos water stations and food and drink stalls. A terribly executed token system leaves us queuing for 75 minutes to buy tokens and then starting again in another line to spend them on overpriced food and water. Theres no cash cards or contactless payments no queue management and uncomfortable scrums of people at entrances exits and walkways at peak times. All of this takes place under a hot sun with the added stress of a chaotic Milan train station and odd autodromo rules  such as only being allowed to bring 500ml water bottles without caps into the festival site or having to scan tickets to exit as well as enter stands. Staff are patient but Im amazed more fans dont freak out. It definitely mars the Monza magic for us and makes the overall experience a bit... well chequered. You are not the first person to report these inconveniences to us and we regret it Federico Martegani of Monzas communications office tells me when I email afterwards. The token system was designed to reduce queues he says but we did not calculate the huge number of people on the weekend 330000 people between Friday and Sunday... an absolute record for us. We apologise for the inconvenience and this problem will certainly serve as a lesson for us to change our approach for next year. I hope so. At any rate none of this reflects on our travel agent or the ontrack action  its on the event organisers. Sam and I end the days dusty sweaty and exhausted with more than 18000 steps on my phones counter. Expand Close Entering the festival atmosphere... Photo Pl  Conghaile  Facebook Twitter Email Whatsapp Entering the festival atmosphere... Photo Pl  Conghaile But we are also elated. And when Sundays Grand Prix starts the frustration quickly fades away. We bring ice cream and sweets. There are DJs and jet flybys leaving smoke trails in green red and white. Shortly before the race drivers are paraded around in vintage openbacked cars  so close we can see their faces. The Rolex clock ticks down and the crowds cheer everything  even the guy sweeping the track who starts to move his brush in time with their roars. The anticipation is electric. When the red lights go out the grid roars into action. The first time the field passes us bunched up and competing for track position at insane speeds it comes with an exhilarating storm of noise stink of rubber and slipstream of wind think of that feeling when a train passes at full pelt on a platform. Beforehand I wondered if the reallife race could match the TV coverage. But we can see screens showing pit stops overtakes and replays hear commentary bouncing between Italian and English and relate the cars flying by to the bigger picture giving us what amounts to the best of both worlds. In that moment being trackside is thrilling. It feels like Sam and I have traced a full circle from our days watching crowdless Covidera sport in isolation to being part of the great Grand Prix circus. We are inside a sport that gave us a new bond when the world shut its engines off. In the end Ferraris drivers are beaten with Verstappen taking the chequered flag on his way to a second World Championship. The tifosi are not impressed. But soon champagne will spray and fans of all hues will spill onto this historic track. After that the travelling bank will pack up and move to the next race in Singapore. I bet they can already feel the F1 cars coming. Expand Close Spa Belgium  Facebook Twitter Email Whatsapp Spa Belgium Formula 1 travel  need to know How to get there Pl was a guest of Cassidy Travel flying to Milan from Dublin with Aer Lingus and staying at the fourstar Hotel Da Vinci. For more information on its F1 travel packages for 2023 see below or visit cassidytravel.iesportsbreaks. Spa Belgium Fournight packages with Grandstand Speed Corner tickets and a threestar hotel stay from 499pp flights extra. The Belgian Grand Prix runs from July 2730. Monza Italy The 2023 Italian Grand Prix runs from August 31 to September 3 next year. Fournight packages including flights a fourstar hotel stay and seated tickets from 675pp. Barcelona Spain A fivenight package with general admission tickets hotel accommodation and return flights starts from 999pp. The Spanish Grand Prix runs from June 14. Should I get general admission or grandstand tickets General admission is usually the cheapest ticket but its all relative  F1 is a pricey sport and tickets are typically for three days. These will allow access to general areas often at track height or raised ground around it with no fixed seats. You will need to arrive early for the best spots especially for qualifying and the Grand Prix itself and remember that the spots are not guaranteed  if you need to go to the loo for example. Grandstands are priced according to the views they offer and the chance of seeing some action  overtakes braking zones chicanes and so on. The priciest are usually opposite the pit lanes and starting grid where you will see the start of the race and the chequered flag. Hospitality tickets offering VIP access can cost many multiples of the price  running to thousands of euro. Seated tickets mean you can come and go from your spot. Its a good idea to try for an elevated view too  this can allow you to see the cars coming earlier and track them for longer. But it will depend on particular circuits the surrounding trees or buildings and so on. What to Pack for a Grand Prix Tracks differ widely in terms of layout locations facilities and weather. Research yours and its prohibited items carefully before compiling your packing list. Inevitably a lot of walking will be involved tracks can be several kilometres long. Wear comfy shoes and loose clothes. You may also need a hat shades sunscreen and a small umbrella for the sunrain as well as a few energy bars and water. A poncho or light rainjacket is handy too. Remember you will have to carry what you bring for the day so check the track rules as to what size bags are allowed and for any specific restrictions  such as the size of water bottles or sunscreen containers and whether phone battery packs or items like tripods are allowed. Ear defenders and ear plugs are a good idea especially for young fans. These can be bought around the track but will cost considerably less outside of it. Its better to have them and find you dont always need them than to regret not having them. A small pair of binoculars can be handy but the cars move so fast it can be hard to track them. A lanyard and pouch is useful to keep tickets and QR codes visible as they need to be scanned regularly to access stands  also to keep them safe. At the track Get a programme and figure out what action you want to see  the Formula 1 highlights of course but it will also include F2 races vintage parades and a surprising number of undercard races. Generally speaking concession stalls for food drink and merch are less busy during the popular track action or outside of peak times like lunch. You may also find cheaper food drink and souvenirs though not official merch outside of the festival boundaries. Be mindful of things like your phone battery and have a safety plan for kids in case you get separated. After the chequered flag some circuits allow fans onto the track for the champagne celebrations  research where this access will be and have a think about your exit and whether the crowds will be safe for families before committing. But most of all have fun More information For more on F1 see formula1.com. See also f1destinations.com and f1experiences.com.
Formula 1’s Toto Wolff accused of running his team remotely leans into software even more, https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/04/formula-1s-toto-wolff-looks-for-fresh-edge-in-2023-through-remote-software/, We really try to go through a system like we have at Formula 1 like a team. In fact Wolff said the team has cut its emissions by nearly 90 in recent years. Surely for a company promising great efficiency to its customers theres nothing like having a revered Formula 1 team boss sing your praises. Earlier this year reports Knight Horner referred to Wolff who lives in Monaco as a tax exile who  he added disparagingly  runs his team remotely. Wolff in conversation with Knight said of Horner in turn Hes just so simple., Toto Wolff the 50yearold Austrian chief executive team principal and partowner of the Mercedes Formula 1 team who was recently described by The New Yorker as someone who might breeze past you in the airport smelling good wearing loafers and no socks talked openly yesterday about his teams terrible nogood year. Sitting with Oliver Steil the CEO of the German company TeamViewer a popular maker of remote support software Wolff also described how the troubled racing team is counting in part on TeamViewers tech to give it an edge in its bid to recapture its former glory. The two were speaking at the Web Summit conference in Lisbon and Wolff was cheered when he appeared before the crowd owing in no small part to Drive to Survive the Netflix series that has made him famous. He finds this amusing recounting to New Yorker writer Sam Knight how a young woman threw herself through the open window of his car to get her picture taken. Wolff immediately acknowledged the obvious as he settled in. We won the championship eight times in a row he said but that is the past. Mercedes he continued just got the physics wrong . . . and got the concept of the car not in the right place he said referring to the design of its floor which he has previously pointed to as the root of the teams lackluster year. Every few years the F1 teams  there are currently 10 altogether  are forced by the body overseeing Grand Prix racing to redesign their cars. Indeed its largely because it takes a long time to unwind things that are built into the car said Wolff that his team last year turned to TeamViewer a 17yearold publicly traded company whose software can remotely access and connect any computer tablet laptop mobile device or IoT endpoint like an industrial machine  or race car  to allow the remote control management and monitoring of these devices. Its a match made in heaven suggested Steil who said that TeamViewer is working closely with the MercedesAMG Petronas team to make it more efficient including running lab tests out of hours and supporting the trackside crew via remote engineers. We really try to go through a system like we have at Formula 1 like a team. We see the different parts and we see what can we do differently if we connect in real time in addition to what we do maybe on trackside and in the back office. Were really working through the different parts of the organization on testing obviously production maintenance wind tunnel all these kinds of applications where we try to see where can be better . . . Wolff chimed in separately to paint the bigger picture. We are racing 23 times around the world around the globe during the racing season and our core team is just 90 engineers with 2000 back at the factory including 1000 people focused on the chassis side and another 1000 focused on the engine. Operating in the field or we call it surgery in the field Wolff said is not always trivial because if you open up an engine or a complicated cooling system you want to have the resource from back at home and TeamViewer is the only technology that allows us today in having the guy back at home look through the same borescope into the cylinder head then help the mechanic on the field. As an added and not inconsequential benefit said both men the partnership cuts down on emissions because it means moving fewer people around at a time when Mercedes is focusing increasingly on sustainability. In fact Wolff said the team has cut its emissions by nearly 90 in recent years. It is our responsibility to show our global audience of billions of spectators that if we can do it everyone can do it he said. Certainly the appearance was a great moment for TeamViewer whose other clients range from telecommunications companies to the fastfood franchise Wendys. Surely for a company promising great efficiency to its customers theres nothing like having a revered Formula 1 team boss sing your praises. Of course what racing fans want to know is whether the tech will give Mercedes  which has yet to win a race in 2022  enough of an edge to overcome the teams archrivals Red Bull and Ferrari. While Wolff is looking to tomorrow as he said yesterday it could take a while even with the faster feedback loops that TeamViewers technology provides the team. As he recently told the outlet RacingNews365 Mercedes is still eight to 10 months behind Red Bull in terms of Formula 1 development after its frustrating 2022 season. There is definitely a challenge he added but we are playing the long game all of us. The intense rivalry between the two teams though perfect for television remains very real in the meantime. As The New Yorker piece observes of the 10 team principals in the sport only Wolff and Christian Horner who runs the Red Bull team have ever won a world championship and they appear to truly loathe one another. Earlier this year reports Knight Horner referred to Wolff who lives in Monaco as a tax exile who  he added disparagingly  runs his team remotely. Wolff in conversation with Knight said of Horner in turn Hes just so simple.

Formula 1 are alienating themselves from their fans (again), https://www.gpblog.com/en/news/154419/formula-1-are-alienating-themselves-from-their-fans-again.html, RevenueTo understand ticket prices it is necessary to understand how Formula 1 generates revenue. The organiser of a Grand Prix pays Liberty Media up to around 40 million to host a race. Knowing that many people want to attend a Grand Prix they think they can even make a profit. But if ticket prices stay like this or rise further we will get the days of Bernie back. This article was written by Ludo van Denderen and originally published on the Dutch edition of GPblogRead more Heineken title sponsor of Las Vegas Grand Prix in 2023, It was the time when Dutch driver Christijan Albers was racing in Formula 1 that my colleague asked the chief sports editor of the Algemeen Dagblad in the Netherlands Why dont we go to those Grands Prix Theres a Dutchman competing The chief barely looked up from behind his computer. Formula One No there is no interest in that. Were not doing it. Article continues under ad These days the newspaper travels all over the world to report on Max Verstappen. Preferably as many reports as possible are written because Algemeen Dagblad knows they are read en masse. As all over the world coverage of the premier motorsport class has increased in recent years. Even in the United States the country that never seemed to care about Formula 1. Quality Of course it is great to see how popular F1 is at the moment. To a large extent this is thanks to the efforts of Liberty Media. Since the US company took over the rights from Bernie Ecclestone there has been a quality drive especially online to engage new generations. Formula 1 is more than just a sport it is also a show and entertainment. Americans understand that like no other. Read more Cheaper F1 tickets to attract more fans Unfortunately Formula 1 and in their wake the organisers of Grands Prix are starting to strike out which  just when things are going so well  may lead to the alienation of fans. Not only is there hardly any country that does not require a special season ticket to watch the races the prices of Grand Prix entry tickets are also taking absurd forms. Revenue To understand ticket prices it is necessary to understand how Formula 1 generates revenue. The organiser of a Grand Prix pays Liberty Media up to around 40 million to host a race. With increasing demand from countries and cities to have a Grand Prix Libertys adage is If you dont want to pay that well go elsewhere. So organisers are pulling out the purse strings. Little choice. Article continues under ad Somewhere organisers have to recoup this money. With ticket sales in other words. Knowing that many people want to attend a Grand Prix they think they can even make a profit. The fans will pay anyway. Indeed they do. For a threeday ticket on a windy grandstand at the hardtoreach SpaFrancorchamps 500 to over 600 euros is easily paid. Or take Monza which has tripled prices over the past three years. The Italians come anyway. Absurd The absolute low point now is Las Vegas. Surely its insane that you have to pay 2000 to see Formula One cars go by for a few seconds a lap Think about it for a moment. 2000. That could be a months salary. If you want to go as a couple with two children 8000. And that doesnt include a hotel. Just four seats. Indeed up to this point fans lay down hundreds if not thousands of euros or dollars to attend a race. With rising inflation and more and more people in money worries the question is how long Formula 1 was once under Bernie the plaything of the elite. It was precisely that image that the sport was slowly losing. Formula 1 is now synonymous with a peoples party. For everyone. But if ticket prices stay like this or rise further we will get the days of Bernie back. Then Formula 1 will be back to what it once was for the happy few.

Wolff: Reputation damage from breaking F1 cost cap enough of a deterrent, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/wolff-reputation-damage-from-breaking-f1-cost-cap-enough-of-a-deterrent/10394949/, Red Bulls breach of the cost cap limit in 2021 triggered a major controversy within F1 recently with opinions divided in the paddock about how extreme the sanctions taken again it should be. And reflecting on his stance Wolff said the main thing that would turn teams off from risking even minor breaches was the bad publicity such a move brings. Beyond the sporting penalty and the financial penalty which obviously resonates in the real world out there there is a big reputational consequence said Wolff. Were getting kids that are being bullied in playgrounds that are employees children that is not right through fictitious allegations from other teams. It was a first strong governance strong policing independent assessment., Red Bulls breach of the cost cap limit in 2021 triggered a major controversy within F1 recently with opinions divided in the paddock about how extreme the sanctions taken again it should be. In the end the Milton Keynesbased outfit was handed a 7 million fine and had its aero development allowance cut back by 10 because it overspent by around 1.8 million last year. Wolff was quite calm about the penalty the FIA settled on admitting in Mexico that while Mercedes felt it was too little equally he accepted Red Bull probably felt it was too harsh. And reflecting on his stance Wolff said the main thing that would turn teams off from risking even minor breaches was the bad publicity such a move brings. Beyond the sporting penalty and the financial penalty which obviously resonates in the real world out there there is a big reputational consequence said Wolff. And that is why I believe no team is going to put a foot wrong over the line because you dont want to have your partners and your team dragged into this space. Were living in a transparent compliant world. Everything needs governance and the sport needs it. As a sport overall this is the real achievement of the whole process. Toto Wolff Team Principal and CEO Mercedes AMG Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images Red Bull has found itself on the receiving end of some extreme media criticisms in recent weeks and its team principal Christian Horner has not been happy about the strains the cost cap case has put on staff  especially when words like cheating have been bandied about. Weve been on trial because of public accusations since Singapore said Horner recently. The numbers have been put out in the media that are miles out of reality. And the damage that does to the brand to our partners to our drivers to our workforce in an age where mental health is prevalent were seeing significant issues within our workforce. Were getting kids that are being bullied in playgrounds that are employees children that is not right through fictitious allegations from other teams. You cannot go around just making that kind of allegation without any fact or substance. We absolutely are appalled at the behaviour of some of our competitors. Asked why Mercedes had been so calm about Red Bulls final penalty despite initial anger when it emerged the rule breach had taken place Wolff said Im beyond the point now that I want to comment on what is being said there. So for me the most important outcome of this whole process is there is a penalty whether its too small right or too big  difficult to judge. It was a first strong governance strong policing independent assessment. And then a fine. That wouldnt have been the case in the past I guess.

A champion in F2 and Formula E the Dutchman had been knocking on the door of F1 for several years  making an array of test outings  when he stormed to a points finish for Williams in place of the unwell Alex Albon at Monza a performance which helped him land a fulltime seat with AlphaTauri for next season.

McLaren star's new attitude towards his F1 dream, https://the-race.com/formula-1/mclaren-stars-new-attitude-towards-his-f1-dream/, In little more than a year Pato OWard went from Red Bull F1 junior programme reject  in ridiculous fashion  to IndyCar star and future F1 tester with McLaren. The fact hes being trusted with 10 million Ayrton Senna McLaren F1 cars reflects the regard he is held in at McLaren but his approach to driving that car perhaps reflects a new or modified attitude OWard has towards his chances of making it to F1. Asked by The Race about how hes balancing his IndyCar career with keeping his foot in the door with F1 OWard says Step by step I guess Yeah step by step. But its also very important to enjoy where youre at enjoy the moment enjoy the present and maximise it., In little more than a year Pato OWard went from Red Bull F1 junior programme reject  in ridiculous fashion  to IndyCar star and future F1 tester with McLaren. The fact hes being trusted with 10 million Ayrton Senna McLaren F1 cars reflects the regard he is held in at McLaren but his approach to driving that car perhaps reflects a new or modified attitude OWard has towards his chances of making it to F1. Why driving Sennas M c Laren left OWard feeling mad Read more When he won the Texas IndyCar race in 2021 as part of a bet with Zak Brown he would get to test McLaren machinery in Abu Dhabi at the end of the year. It completed a whirlwind turnaround in fortune for the driver who was promised so much in the past but dare he dream this time it would be a reality Complications around the end of last year and the beginning of this one surrounding OWards future contract put a damper on a test where he probably wasnt physically prepared enough for F1  see comments about his neck being destroyed  and hed probably admit now he allowed himself to get caught up in the narrative that an F1 future was possible before it was realistic. Asked by The Race about how hes balancing his IndyCar career with keeping his foot in the door with F1 OWard says Step by step I guess Yeah step by step. And its important not to get too ahead of yourself. And its hard not to  very hard not to. But its also very important to enjoy where youre at enjoy the moment enjoy the present and maximise it. And I feel like with doing so doors will open and things will align. If I keep doing my job properly and keep performing. OWards contract dispute with McLaren turned messy and clouded the first part of the year until things began to turn around in April and at the Long Beach race in IndyCar OWard used a hotel room discussion with his cousin to establish a new attitude which can be over simplified for explanation purposes as you can only focus on what you can control everything else is out of your hands and will fall into place. Targeting a proper offseason and spending time with his family is a top priority for OWard as he felt like the business of last years post IndyCar season activities left him jaded by the time the season came around in February alongside his contract dispute that dragged on. It just sucked  M c Laren contract sagas effect on OWard Read more With a new contract in May he found a new level and only reliability issues halted a title campaign that featured him qualifying in IndyCars Fast Six on every single road course this year. Sorting his contract focusing on things he could control and ensuring time for himself away from the track all helped construct this new mentality or at least approach. Now OWard faces the complication of 2021 IndyCar champion Alex Palou coming into the fold and testing at McLaren as the pair shared F1 tests in Barcelona and Austria last month with Palou taking the first FP1 opportunity and running less than three tenths off Lando Norris on comparable tyres at COTA. Palou wasnt allowed to shine in FP1  but he still impressed Read more But OWards revised attitude  plus what appears to be the inherent belief he can take on and beat Palou on a level playing field  means F1 opportunities are a bonus as opposed to a key part of his immediate goals. After Im done with the FP1 Ill be able to relate a little bit more what it feels like but Im just so grateful for the opportunity adds OWard. And I want to be a sponge just absorb everything that Im learning and continue to learn. And just keep improving  help the team and just never forget to enjoy it because thats the most important thing. Enjoying it is a phrase that can certainly be used to describe OWards opinion of driving the Senna McLaren MP45B at Laguna Seca last month. Even if that came with pressure  Brown made sure OWard knew the cars 10 million value just as he was getting in the car to take it for a spin  the enjoyment and carefree attitude OWard approached the historic test in is the perfect metaphor for the new mental space hes approaching his contemporary F1 opportunities with.
F1 finally ready to consider credible 11th-team entry, https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-news/95331/f1-11-team-stefano-domenicali/, Sam HallFriday 4 November 2022 1514  Updated 1518F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali has claimed the sport is finally ready to entertain credible proposals to increase the grid to 11 teams. The value of the 10 teams currently in F1 has risen steeply since Liberty Media acquired the championship ahead of the 2017 season. Despite appearing to warm to the idea of an 11th team Domenicali warned again that it cannot come at a price to existing teams. This is what is written in the Concorde Agreement but mainly the point is that does a new entry bring a better position for the F1 world championship This is really in terms of value from a financial point of view and in terms of value from a sporting point of view., Sam Hall Friday 4 November 2022 1514  Updated 1518 F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali has claimed the sport is finally ready to entertain credible proposals to increase the grid to 11 teams. The value of the 10 teams currently in F1 has risen steeply since Liberty Media acquired the championship ahead of the 2017 season. This value was protected in the latest Concorde Agreement by the addition of a 200million antidilution fee that would be split between the existing teams upon the arrival of a new entry. Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff has been vocal in his opposition to any new team unless it can benefit the entire paddock and although echoing these comments Domenicali has hinted at a change in the position now from F1. It is not a problem having one more team to have better racing therefore we will see and we will monitor the situation said Domenicali in an investors call following the release of Liberty Medias thirdquarter financial results. READ MORE...F1 enjoys another revenue bump as recovery continues If there would be a real credible new entry that wants to discuss with us we are ready to discuss but we are not in a rushed position today for that. Franchise dilution cannot be allowed Michael Andretti has been battling to position his successful outfit in the sport and recently told GPFans that F1 would be our life. Despite appearing to warm to the idea of an 11th team Domenicali warned again that it cannot come at a price to existing teams. With regard to the value or the process of the possibility of bringing a new F1 team into the championship of course there is the primary step that both us and the FIA have to be in agreement on that he added. And I think the first thing that we need to consider is will this eventual possibility bring extra value to the championship If so of course we are going to discuss it internally and we will see if there is any kind of real potential for a new entry that can give value to the championship. On top of this there is a value that has to be recognised to the teams that are already in the championship because of course they cannot allow any dilution of their partnership with the F1 championship. This is what is written in the Concorde Agreement but mainly the point is that does a new entry bring a better position for the F1 world championship This is really in terms of value from a financial point of view and in terms of value from a sporting point of view.
Formula 1 | F1 and the USA a very lucrative honeymoon - US Sports, https://lookcharms.com/formula-1-f1-and-the-usa-a-very-lucrative-honeymoon/, Last June we learned that the broadcaster of F1 in the USA ESPN was now going to pay 75 to 90 million dollars a year  that is 15 times more than before. This can be seen in particular in the new sponsorship deals signed  US firms partnering with F1 teams. In total the number of deals between F1 teams and US sponsors has jumped 66 since 2020 and 21.1 yearonyear. As for Red Bull its new title sponsor Oracle also comes to us from the USA. Notably also if F1 teams engage with American companies it is not only for the money offered but also for their nationality., As we know F1 is in full and strong growth in the USA  the stands were packed in Austin last month and no less than 3 Grands Prix will take place next year on American territory Miami Austin Las Vegas . The FOM benefits from this great exposure but of course the teams also. Last June we learned that the broadcaster of F1 in the USA ESPN was now going to pay 75 to 90 million dollars a year  that is 15 times more than before. This can be seen in particular in the new sponsorship deals signed  US firms partnering with F1 teams. In total the number of deals between F1 teams and US sponsors has jumped 66 since 2020 and 21.1 yearonyear. 161 deals currently exist between American companies and F1 just for the year 2022 alone testifying to the extent of the partnership between the two shores of the Atlantic. In 2021 there were 133 agreements and in 2020 97 only. The latest example comes from Haas which announced the addition of USbased MoneyGram as title sponsor. For two years the McLaren has also been loaded with new sponsors mostly Americans like CNN or Google. As for Red Bull its new title sponsor Oracle also comes to us from the USA. The amount would be colossal we are talking about 500 million dollars over three years i.e. more than 70 of the amount of capped budgets covered per year. Notably also if F1 teams engage with American companies it is not only for the money offered but also for their nationality. Another company showed great interest and we chose MoneyGram partly because the other company was not American thus recently declared Gnther Steiner on the choice of MoneyGram. Ferrari at the brand level also benefits income from sponsors has grown by 26 in one year. Finally lets not forget that Williams recently went under the American flag with Dorilton Capital and that another American team Andretti is currently pushing hard to join the sport.
F1 reports increase in quarterly revenue in COVID-19 recovery, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/f1-reports-increase-in-quarterly-revenue-as-covid-recovery-complete/10394982/, Overall F1 revenue rose from 668m in 2021 to 715m in 2022 for JulySeptember although operating income was only up from 80m to 82m thanks to increased costs. Primary F1 revenue increased in the third quarter with growth across media rights and sponsorship partially offset by a decline in race promotion revenue. Media rights increased due to growth in F1 TV subscription revenue and increased fees under new and renewed contractual agreements and sponsorship revenue increased due to the recognition of revenue from new sponsors. In addition other cost of F1 revenue grew due to higher commissions and partner servicing costs associated with the primary F1 revenue streams and higher Formula 2 and Formula 3 related costs. Selling general and administrative expense increased in the third quarter due to higher personnel and IT costs and increased legal and other advisory fees., However the change was not as dramatic as in previous quarters because income in the latter part of 2021 was not impacted as dramatically by the pandemic as last year race attendances began to return to normal levels and the lucrative Paddock Club got back up to speed. Overall F1 revenue rose from 668m in 2021 to 715m in 2022 for JulySeptember although operating income was only up from 80m to 82m thanks to increased costs. The 10 F1 teams shared payments of 370m up from 338m in 2021. The JulySeptember periods of 2021 and 2022 provide for a fairly accurate comparison as both featured seven races. Six events were the same across both seasons while the major difference was that the first year featured the more lucrative Russian GP whereas France fell into the same period in 2022. Because of that change race promotion income was actually slightly down but that was offset by increases in broadcast and sponsorship revenue. Explaining the figures F1 noted F1s results in 2022 are not being impacted by capacity limitations and throughout the first nine months of the 2022 season F1 has seen strong growth in attendance in the grandstands and the Paddock Club. Primary F1 revenue increased in the third quarter with growth across media rights and sponsorship partially offset by a decline in race promotion revenue. The F1 logo Photo by Drew Gibson  Motorsport Images Race promotion revenue decreased due to lower fees generated from the different mix of events held with one additional race held outside of Europe in the prior year period. Media rights increased due to growth in F1 TV subscription revenue and increased fees under new and renewed contractual agreements and sponsorship revenue increased due to the recognition of revenue from new sponsors. Other F1 revenue increased in the third quarter primarily due to higher hospitality revenue generated from the Paddock Club which operated at one additional race in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the prior year period and has seen record attendance yeartodate. Explaining the overall rise in costs relative to 2021 F1 said These costs increased in the third quarter driven by the costs of higher hospitality attendance in the Paddock Club and one additional Paddock Club event operated compared to the prior year period. In addition other cost of F1 revenue grew due to higher commissions and partner servicing costs associated with the primary F1 revenue streams and higher Formula 2 and Formula 3 related costs. Selling general and administrative expense increased in the third quarter due to higher personnel and IT costs and increased legal and other advisory fees.
Ricciardo insists new Hamilton contract wouldn’t affect his F1 future as he aims to ‘come back with a vengeance’ in 2024, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.ricciardo-insists-new-hamilton-contract-wouldnt-affect-his-f1-future-as-he.njoqmlge4S9irGhkIVrvS.html, Daniel Ricciardo has brushed off suggestions that a fresh deal for Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes could make returning to the F1 grid in 2024 more difficult as he prepares to embark on a year out of the sport.

Ricciardo will be replaced by fellow Australian Oscar Piastri at McLaren next season and with Haas holding the one remaining vacancy on the 2023 grid the 33yearold recently admitted that its almost certain he wont be competing. READ MORE I wish it was like this more often  Ricciardo delighted with P7 finish as he explains Tsunoda crash One role Ricciardo remains open to is that of a reserve driver before working his way back into a race seat for the 2024 campaign with his name recently being linked to Mercedes  who need to replace AlphaTauribound Nyck de Vries. However a promotion from reserve duties to a race seat at the Silver Arrows appears unlikely at least in the near future with George Russell tied down on a longterm deal and team mate Hamilton confirming over the Mexico City Grand Prix weekend that he intends to sign a new contract. Ricciardo is set for a season out of the sport after a challenging twoyear spell at McLaren As the wait goes on to discover where Ricciardo will end up he made clear that his future ambitions are not pinned on the decisions of other drivers while expressing hope that Hamilton will continue for many years to come. The truth is I want him to stay in the sport. Hes one of the greatest ever to do it and I think competing with him going wheel to wheel with him is fun its awesome.

Asked by Sky Sports F1 about the prospect of Ricciardo joining Mercedes in a reserve role Russell said Yeah I think thatd be interesting. I think wed like to see that. But its up to Daniel to see what he wants to do with his future. Ricciardo enjoyed plenty of ontrack battles with Hamilton during his time at Red Bull

Primary F1 revenue represents the majority of F1s revenue and is derived from i race promotion revenue ii media rights fees and iii sponsorship fees. There were seven races held in the third quarters of both 2022 and 2021. There are 22 events scheduled for the 2022 race calendar. Throughout 2021 and particularly in the first half of the season attendance at races was limited due to the pandemic. Restrictions on fan attendance reduced as 2021 progressed with all races in the second half of the year operating at either full capacity or with fewer restrictions. The Paddock Club resumed normal operations beginning with the Austrian Grand Prix on July 4 2021. F1s results in 2022 are not being impacted by capacity limitations and throughout the first nine months of the 2022 season F1 has seen strong growth in attendance in the grandstands and the Paddock Club. Primary F1 revenue increased in the third quarter with growth across media rights and sponsorship partially offset by a decline in race promotion revenue. Race promotion revenue decreased due to lower fees generated from the different mix of events held with one additional race held outside of Europe in the prior year period. Media rights increased due to growth in F1 TV subscription revenue and increased fees under new and renewed contractual agreements and sponsorship revenue increased due to the recognition of revenue from new sponsors. Other F1 revenue increased in the third quarter primarily due to higher hospitality revenue generated from the Paddock Club which operated at one additional race in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the prior year period and has seen record attendance yeartodate. Operating income was flat and adjusted OIBDA2 decreased in the third quarter. Cost of F1 revenue increased compared to the prior year due to the pro rata recognition of increased team payments. Other cost of F1 revenue is largely variable in nature and mostly relates to revenue opportunities. These costs increased in the third quarter driven by the costs of higher hospitality attendance in the Paddock Club and one additional Paddock Club event operated compared to the prior year period. In addition other cost of F1 revenue grew due to higher commissions and partner servicing costs associated with the Primary F1 revenue streams and higher Formula 2 and Formula 3 related costs. Selling general and administrative expense increased in the third quarter due to higher personnel and IT costs and increased legal and other advisory fees. The Liberty SiriusXM Group holds an approximate 1.8 intergroup interest 4.2 million notional shares in the Formula One Group as of October 31 2022. These shares are not included in the outstanding share count of Formula One Group in Liberty Medias most recent Form 10Q. Assuming the issuance of the shares underlying this intergroup interest the Formula One Group outstanding share count as of October 31 2022 would have been 238 million. The businesses and assets attributed to the Formula One Group consist of Liberty Medias subsidiary F1 its interest in Liberty Media Acquisition Corporation other minority investments and an intergroup interest in the Braves Group. BRAVES GROUP  The following table provides the financial results attributed to the Braves Group for the third quarter of 2022. In the third quarter approximately 5 million of corporate level selling general and administrative expense including stockbased compensation expense was allocated to the Braves Group. 3Q21 3Q22 amounts in millions Braves Group Revenue Corporate and other  234  252 Operating Income Corporate and other  30  8 Adjusted OIBDA Corporate and other  55  38 The following table provides the operating results of Braves Holdings LLC Braves. 3Q21 3Q22  Change amounts in millions Baseball revenue  222  238 7  Development revenue 12 14 17  Total revenue 234 252 8  Operating expenses excluding stockbased compensation included below Other operating expenses 153 184 20  Selling general and administrative expenses 23 27 17  Adjusted OIBDA  58  41 29  Impairment restructuring and acquisition costs net of recoveries  5 NM Stockbased compensation 2 2   Depreciation and Amortization 21 21   Operating income  35  13 63  Number of home games in period 34 38 Baseball revenue is derived from two primary sources i ballpark event revenue ticket sales concessions advertising sponsorships suites and premium seat fees and ii broadcasting revenue including national and local broadcast rights. Development revenue is derived from the Battery Atlanta mixeduse facilities and primarily includes rental income. There were 38 home games played in the third quarter of 2022 compared to 34 games played in the prior year period. A full 162 game schedule was played in 2022. Baseball revenue increased in the third quarter due to more home games played and increased ticket demand at regular season games as well as additional special events including concerts held at the ballpark compared to the period year period. Development revenue increased during the third quarter due to a reduction in deferred payment arrangements and increases in rental income from various new lease commencements. Operating income and adjusted OIBDA decreased in the third quarter. Increased operating costs due to higher player salaries higher levels of facility and game day expenses driven by more home games and higher attendance and increased expenses under MLBs revenue sharing plan more than offset revenue growth. Selling general and administrative expense increased primarily due to increased special event expenses marketing initiatives and personnel costs. The Formula One Group holds an approximate 11.1 intergroup interest 6.8 million notional shares and the Liberty SiriusXM Group holds an approximate 2.9 intergroup interest 1.8 million notional shares in the Braves Group as of October 31 2022. These shares are not included in the outstanding share count of the Braves Group in Liberty Medias most recent Form 10Q. Assuming the issuance of the shares underlying these intergroup interests the Braves Group outstanding share count as of October 31 2022 would have been 61 million. The businesses and assets attributed to the Braves Group consist primarily of Liberty Medias subsidiary the Braves which indirectly owns the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball Club and certain assets and liabilities associated with the Braves ballpark and mixeduse development project.

regarding our financial results this press release includes a presentation of Adjusted OIBDA which is a nonGAAP financial measure for the Liberty SiriusXM Group the Braves Group and the Formula One Group together with reconciliations to operating income as determined under GAAP. Liberty Media defines Adjusted OIBDA as operating income loss plus depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation separately reported litigation settlements restructuring acquisition and other related costs and impairment charges. Liberty Media believes Adjusted OIBDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition this measure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Because Adjusted OIBDA is used as a measure of operating performance Liberty Media views operating income as the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted OIBDA is not meant to replace or supersede operating income or any other GAAP measure but rather to supplement such GAAP measures in order to present investors with the same information that Liberty Medias management considers in assessing the results of operations and performance of its assets. The following table provides a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA for Liberty Media to operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP for the three months ended September 30 2021 and September 30 2022 respectively. QUARTERLY SUMMARY amounts in millions 3Q21 3Q22 Liberty SiriusXM Group Operating Income  604  434 Depreciation and amortization 152 157 Stock compensation expense 54 53 Impairment restructuring and acquisition costs net of recoveriesa 95  69 Adjusted OIBDA  715  713 Formula One Group Operating Income  68  64 Depreciation and amortization 100 89 Stock compensation expense 8 5 Adjusted OIBDA  176  158 Braves Group Operating Income  30  8 Depreciation and amortization 22 22 Stock compensation expense 3 3 Impairment restructuring and acquisition costs net of recoveriesa  5 Adjusted OIBDA  55  38 Liberty Media Corporation Consolidated Operating Income  702  506 Depreciation and amortization 274 268 Stock compensation expense 65 61 Impairment restructuring and acquisition costs net of recoveriesa 95  74 Adjusted OIBDA  946  909  a During the three months ended September 30 2021 SiriusXM recorded insurance recoveries related to the SXM7 satellite of 80 million as well as the reversal of a 17 million liability related to the Stitcher acquisition. During the three months ended September 30 2022 Sirius XM recorded impairment losses of 43 million related to the termination of certain software projects 20 million related to the impairment of vacated office spaces and 5 million related to personnel severance and Braves Holdings recorded 5 million of impairment losses as a result of hurricane damage at its spring training facility in Florida. These charges have been excluded from adjusted OIBDA. SCHEDULE 2 This press release also includes a presentation of adjusted EBITDA of SiriusXM which is a nonGAAP financial measure used by SiriusXM together with a reconciliation to SiriusXMs standalone net income as determined under GAAP. SiriusXM defines adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense income tax expense and depreciation and amortization. SiriusXM adjusts EBITDA to exclude the impact of other expense income as well as certain other charges discussed below. Adjusted EBITDA is a NonGAAP financial measure that excludes or adjusts for if applicable i loss on extinguishment of debt ii sharebased payment expense iii impairment restructuring and acquisition costs iv legal settlementsreserves and v other significant operating expense income that do not relate to the ongoing performance of SiriusXMs business. SiriusXM believes adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of the underlying trend of its operating performance which provides useful information about its business apart from the costs associated with its capital structure and purchase price accounting. SiriusXM believes investors find this NonGAAP financial measure useful when analyzing past operating performance with current performance and comparing SiriusXMs operating performance to the performance of other communications entertainment and media companies. SiriusXM believes investors use adjusted EBITDA to estimate current enterprise value and to make investment decisions. As a result of large capital investments in SiriusXMs satellite radio system its results of operations reflect significant charges for depreciation expense. SiriusXM believes the exclusion of sharebased payment expense is useful as it is not directly related to the operational conditions of its business. SiriusXM also believes the exclusion of the legal settlements and reserves impairment restructuring and acquisition related costs and loss on extinguishment of debt to the extent they occur during the period is useful as they are significant expenses not incurred as part of its normal operations for the period. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to SiriusXMs statements of comprehensive income of certain expenses including sharebased payment expense. SiriusXM endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the NonGAAP measure presented by also providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items including quantifying such items to derive the NonGAAP measure. Investors that wish to compare and evaluate operating results after giving effect for these costs should refer to net income as disclosed in SiriusXMs unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Since adjusted EBITDA is a NonGAAP financial performance measure SiriusXMs calculation of adjusted EBITDA may be susceptible to varying calculations may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered in isolation as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliation of net income to the adjusted EBITDA is calculated as follows Unaudited For the Three Months Ended September 30 2021 2022  in millions Net income  343  247 Add back items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA Impairment restructuring and acquisition costsa 95  69 Sharebased payment expense 51 50 Depreciation and amortization 135 134 Interest expense 111 107 Loss on extinguishment of debt 83  Other expense income 1 3 Income tax benefit expense 90 110 Adjusted EBITDA  719  720  a During the three months ended September 30 2021 SiriusXM recorded insurance recoveries related to the SXM7 satellite of 80 million as well as the reversal of a 17 million liability related to the Stitcher acquisition. During the three months ended September 30 2022 Sirius XM recorded impairment losses of 43 million related to the termination of certain software projects 20 million related to the impairment of vacated office spaces and 5 million related to personnel severance. These charges have been excluded from adjusted OIBDA. View source version on businesswire.com  Courtnee Chun 720 8755420 Source Liberty Media Corporation

Alpine: F1 2022 engine performance gain worth reliability risks, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/alpine-f1-2022-engine-performance-gain-worth-reliability-risks/10394839/, In Mexico Fernando Alonso lost seventh place in the closing laps after suffering a cylinder issue that obliged him to stop. Szafnauer insists that problems have largely resulted from a general push for performance with the power unit and that they can be resolved over the winter. So we made a conscious decision to push the performance envelope and fix reliability issues as we got to them because the FIA allows that. But if you have to err on that side you push the performance boundary because you cant add performance now until 2026 you can fix reliability issues. But the short term is reliability in the next few races finish strong and I think our performance will be there., Listen to this article The team has suffered more reliability problems than most rivals costing valuable ground in the battle with McLaren for fourth in the world championship. Alpine is currently in front by just seven points. In Mexico Fernando Alonso lost seventh place in the closing laps after suffering a cylinder issue that obliged him to stop. Szafnauer insists that problems have largely resulted from a general push for performance with the power unit and that they can be resolved over the winter. We mustnt forget that at the beginning of the year we set out  and this was before I was here but I think it was the right decision on the powertrain side  to err on the side of performance he said said. Because the powertrain was going to be frozen. So we made a conscious decision to push the performance envelope and fix reliability issues as we got to them because the FIA allows that. So that was a conscious and strategic decision. And now when we face them we can fix them. We didnt do it on purpose to not be reliable. But if you have to err on that side you push the performance boundary because you cant add performance now until 2026 you can fix reliability issues. And we can do it over the winter. So strategically I think it was the right thing to do. And we still have two races left to finish in fourth. I think we can do that. Asked by Motorsport.com if it was frustrating to lose valuable points in Mexico he said Ill tell you my frustration after Abu Dhabi For sure you want to score more points. Fernando Alonso Alpine F1 Team climbs out of his car after retiring from the race Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images Szafnauer acknowledged that it doesnt matter what margin Alpine beats McLaren by as long as the team can stay in front. No not at this point. And then over the winter well make even more reliability improvements. You cant improve the performance it is what it is. And well be better off. But weve got to remember this powertrain has to last until 2026. So for sure it was the right strategy. I think were on a good trajectory. And lets see what next year brings. But the short term is reliability in the next few races finish strong and I think our performance will be there. Szafnauer says that the Renault engine division in ViryChatillon knows what it has to do having fixed other issues earlier in the season. Yeah more than I do for example he said. So I was asking them about the Mexico cylinder failure. And then although I spent seven and a half years at Honda powertrains theyve got a much deeper understanding and theyll figure it out. But like I said strategically thats what we set out to do. Every time we have an issue we fix it. It doesnt come back. So this was a little bit different than what we had in Singapore.

'Magnussen could lose his seat instead' - Schumacher on Haas' driver line-up, https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1016267/1/magnussen-could-lose-his-seat-instead-schumacher-haas-driver-lineup, Haas have yet to decide who will complete their F1 driver lineup for next season. Magnussen has a multiyear deal with the team while the second seat is between Mick Schumacher and Nico Hulkenberg. Since the Austrian Grand Prix Schumacher has often been the quicker of the two Haas drivers particularly on a Sunday. Speaking to Sky Germany Ralf said that Magnussens seat should also be under threat for next season. In the last race Mexcio Mick was sometimes up to sixtenths faster than Magnussen  so lets wait and see for the next few races., Haas have yet to decide who will complete their F1 driver lineup for next season. Magnussen has a multiyear deal with the team while the second seat is between Mick Schumacher and Nico Hulkenberg. Despite impressing on his return at the seasonopening Bahrain Grand Prix Magnussens form has dipped in the second half of the season. Since the Austrian Grand Prix Schumacher has often been the quicker of the two Haas drivers particularly on a Sunday. Speaking to Sky Germany Ralf said that Magnussens seat should also be under threat for next season. Anything is possible of course especially if we look at the last few races he said. Who knows Magnussen may not be so firmly in the seat anymore. If we look at the races since Silverstone we have to conclude that Mick is the more stable and better of the two drivers  and who has also had some bad luck with wrong strategies. In the last race Mexcio Mick was sometimes up to sixtenths faster than Magnussen  so lets wait and see for the next few races. I hope Haas make a decision soon. Maybe next year we will have two Germans on the Formula 1 grid. Recently team boss Guenther Steiner explained that its still 5050 on who will drive for the team alongside Magnussen in 2023. Im honest Its still 5050 he explained. Nothing has been decided yet he said. We will logically not make a decision between Austin and Mexico simply because time is not there. The next time would be the week after Mexico because we dont have a race then and have more time to deal with it.

Red Bull finalises Mateschitz succession plan, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/red-bull-finalises-mateschitz-succession-plan/10394847/, Listen to this articleJust a fortnight after Mateschitz passed away Red Bull has settled on how the company will be controlled going forward. In a letter that Mateschitzs son Mark sent to Red Bull staff he explained that a solution proposed by my father and supported by our Thai partners would be put in place. Before joining Red Bull Mintzlaff was a longdistance runner. Speaking recently Horner said that Mateschitz had ensured that the longterm future of Red Bulls F1 operations was secure. And with in 2026 Red Bull becoming a power unit manufacturer that was the missing piece of our jigsaw and he had the vision to enable that to happen., Listen to this article Just a fortnight after Mateschitz passed away Red Bull has settled on how the company will be controlled going forward. It has been decided that strategicoperational responsibility at Red Bull will no longer be executed by a single CEO as it did under Mateschitz and will instead be divided among three people. In a letter that Mateschitzs son Mark sent to Red Bull staff he explained that a solution proposed by my father and supported by our Thai partners would be put in place. The latter comment is a reference to the Yoovidhya family of entrepreneurs. Red Bulls business will therefore be taken care of in the future by a socalled Board of Directors consisting of Franz Watzlawick CEO Beverage Business Alexander Kirchmayr CFO and Oliver Mintzlaff CEO Corporate Projects and Investments Mateschitz Jr. added Franz Alexander and Oliver were our dream team. I am very happy that they will be taking on this task. The division of responsibility means that F1 teams Red Bull and AlphaTauri will fall under the responsibility of Mintzlaff who counts sponsorship among his new tasks and Kirchmayr from now on. With Kirchmayr being the new CFO in the Group he will likely be the one who gives the thumbsup or thumbsdown on all budgets. A Red Bull statement read Following the passing of Dietrich Mateschitz we are pleased to learn of the appointment of Oliver Mintzlaff to CEO of Corporate Projects and investments. Although there wont be any changes in the daytoday with Oracle Red Bull Racing we look forward to working closely with someone likeminded who has such a strong pedigree in elite sports. Mintzlaff is no stranger to German sports fans. Most recently he was chairman of the board of the Bundesliga soccer club RB Leipzig e. V. and managing director of RB Leipzig GmbH. Prior to that he was in charge of coordinating all of Red Bulls global soccer commitments from 2014 until Leipzigs promotion to the Bundesliga in 2016. Before joining Red Bull Mintzlaff was a longdistance runner. In 1999 he finished fifth in the German halfmarathon championships and eighth in the 10kilometre distance in 2001. Sergio Perez Red Bull Racing RB18 Photo by Steven Tee  Motorsport Images From 2000 to 2008 he worked for the sporting goods manufacturer Puma and later as a player consultant and manager among other things. It is thought unlikely that Red Bulls F1 operations will change much as a result of the new senior management structure especially with F1 team boss Christian Horner having helped lead the squad back to its first championship double since 2013. Speaking recently Horner said that Mateschitz had ensured that the longterm future of Red Bulls F1 operations was secure. The future is set said Horner when asked if any changes would follow Mateschitzs death. Hes put in place a very strong foundation for the future. And with in 2026 Red Bull becoming a power unit manufacturer that was the missing piece of our jigsaw and he had the vision to enable that to happen. And just as weve done with the chassis we will take that same spirit his spirit into the future engine company.

Why Hamilton changed his mind about racing in F1 after 40, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/why-hamilton-changed-his-mind-about-racing-in-f1-after-40/10394765/, Why is a driver who is so determined to make an impact beyond what he does ontrack keen to keep on racing Hamilton admitted in Mexico last week that he wasnt sure what had changed his mind on wanting to keep racing after being 40. Thats been a really interesting process and Im grateful to be a part of it said Hamilton. I get asked every day to do so many different things and Im able to push back and say no. I think theres more stuff to achieve together.Lewis Hamilton Mercedes AMG 2nd position with his trophy Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images, Listen to this article Hamilton has often joked that he does not want to be the oldest driver on the grid embracing the continued contract extensions for Fernando Alonso who at 41 is preparing to keep on racing for at least a few more years. More seriously Hamilton has always vowed that he would not want to keep on racing until he is totally burnt out instead wishing to bow out when he is still fresh and has the energy to focus on other projects. Mission 44 his charity dedicated to improving representation in motorsport and Ignite a charity set up with Mercedes also intended to aid diversity are two such interests that will be the focus of his postracing life ensuring he has a legacy that goes beyond his ontrack achievements. But after Hamilton revealed in a group media interview including Motorsport.com in Austin last month that he plans to sign a new multiyear contract with Mercedes it led to a fresh look at where he currently stands in F1. His existing deal expires at the end of 2023 by when he will be 38. Even if he went on for only another two years that would take him close to his 41st birthday passing a milestone he once scoffed at. So whats changed for Hamilton Why is a driver who is so determined to make an impact beyond what he does ontrack keen to keep on racing Hamilton admitted in Mexico last week that he wasnt sure what had changed his mind on wanting to keep racing after being 40. He mentioned this narrative of winding down towards the end as being something he did not subscribe to and that even with his outside interests the support of Mercedes to pursue them could keep him energised ontrack. Im just in a happy place said Hamilton. Im a lot more grounded Ive got my home that I get to spend time in in the UK when I come to see the team for example my family come down. I have a lot better setup just all round. And I feel like I can take the team to more championships. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes AMG Photo by Steve Etherington  Motorsport Images Hamilton has always made clear that breaking the record for the most championships by winning an eighth title is not something that will define his future even given the circumstances of his defeat to Max Verstappen last year. He has often talked about the journey Mercedes now finds itself on trying to return to the top after being toppled amid its struggles with the new technical regulations for 2022. Walking away while the team is yet to return to the top of the mountain does not seem to be something on Hamiltons radar. Hamilton admitted it was difficult to say how much of an impact the struggles of this year had on his motivation to keep going. If wed had a year like last year and we were competing at the front all year who knows where I would be he pondered. But he spoke of the energy he took from seeing the team come together in 2022 noting the new level vulnerability he has seen in many of his colleagues through the current struggles. Thats been a really interesting process and Im grateful to be a part of it said Hamilton. I cant wait for the time that we get back to success that we finally get that win and we get that championship. Its going to make all these tough moments worthwhile. As Hamilton has gotten further into his 30s he has often spoken of his improved physical condition citing his switch to a plantbased diet in 2018 as being a life changer. When it comes to his training he has also learned to adjust his regimen as the years have gone on as it gets harder for all of us to stay in peak physical condition. So its about being more meticulous with your diet being more meticulous with your training said Hamilton. Like for example I did pilates with a good friend of mine the other day thats an Olympic athlete and it was so funny because it was something that wed never really done before. Id done pilates but just adding different things that you wouldnt normally do being more specific with your daily routine way more than when I was 22  I wasnt doing the things that Im doing today. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes AMG Photo by Steve Etherington  Motorsport Images Hamilton also noted the importance of looked after his mental wellbeing to find good balance within your life including setting boundaries to protect his energy and prevent himself getting overloaded. I never let that get to that point Hamilton explained. Its just about being balanced. I say no to so many things. I get asked every day to do so many different things and Im able to push back and say no. If I know thats going to affect my preparation getting in the way of my training or my time with my team or have any possible impact on my race weekend its a big no. Thats with friends thats with relationships. This is what Im focused on. It has all given Hamilton the kind of longevity that very few athletes will ever enjoy. Two tennis icons Serena Williams and Roger Federer hung up their rackets this year after playing into their early 40s. Tom Brady a friend of Hamiltons has managed to extend his career in the NFL well into his 40s despite the physical demands of the game. All of them act as inspiration to Hamilton. Toto Wolff Hamiltons team principal at Mercedes felt the Brady comparison was apt. For me the best athlete in the world Tom Brady hes on the field and being tackled and throwing the ball and hes 43 years old he said. So as long as you continue to look after yourself and develop your cognitive sensors I think Hamilton has many more years in him. Im pretty certain thats going to be the case here in the team. Wolff plans to sit down with Hamilton during a quiet time over the winter to discuss his next contract which is set to run to at least the end of the 2025 season. The way that Hamilton is talking there is no reason why it has to be his last F1 renewal  and why turning 40 could be long in the past by the time he finally calls it quits. Im not putting a limit on it to be honest Hamilton said when asked how much longer he planned to stay with Mercedes only confirming he was planning to do a multiyear deal with my team. I really really dont know what the next five years hold I think were still trying to work on that he added. Theres a lot of great things that are being put in place like Ive just launched a production company this week. But I feel great in mind and body. I think theres more stuff to achieve together.

McLaren not opposed to keeping Ricciardo as third F1 driver, https://www.motorsportweek.com/2022/11/04/mclaren-not-opposed-to-keeping-ricciardo-as-third-f1-driver/, McLaren is not against the idea of retaining Daniel Ricciardo for 2023 with the Australian continuing in a reserve driver role with the team. Ricciardo will depart his fulltime role with McLaren at the end of the current campaign bringing his original contract to a conclusion one season early. Ricciardo has struggled for performance at McLaren since joining it in 2021 and will be replaced by rookie Oscar Piastri next season following a contract dispute with Alpine.. How much Ricciardo would gain from his side taking on a third driver role with McLaren is a valuable question. The team will never accept him back as a fulltime driver as the 34yearold is hoping to return to a fulltime drive in 2024., McLaren is not against the idea of retaining Daniel Ricciardo for 2023 with the Australian continuing in a reserve driver role with the team. Ricciardo will depart his fulltime role with McLaren at the end of the current campaign bringing his original contract to a conclusion one season early. Ricciardo has struggled for performance at McLaren since joining it in 2021 and will be replaced by rookie Oscar Piastri next season following a contract dispute with Alpine.. Although his future plans are not yet known Ricciardo has confirmed that he wont be racing in F1 next year  however he wishes to remain part of the grid and assist a team. He has been linked to Mercedes and his former Red Bull squad but McLaren team boss Andreas Seidl admits that it is possible he could remain with the Wokingbased outfit in 2023. Thats a discussion we havent had yet Seidl said as quoted by the Spanish edition of Motorsport.com. Its a discussion we usually have in the winter as you know also we had an agreement with other teams to share referring to Piastri so theres absolutely no lets say bad feelings between Daniel and us so its possible. Is a fresh start the best option for Ricciardo How much Ricciardo would gain from his side taking on a third driver role with McLaren is a valuable question. The team will never accept him back as a fulltime driver as the 34yearold is hoping to return to a fulltime drive in 2024. While remaining part of the McLaren outfit would showcase his maturity to not be deterred from a difficult situation linking up with a fresh team perhaps Mercedes would leave him in a stronger position. Both Lewis Hamilton and George Russell have welcomed the chance to work with the eighttime grand prix winner. He would gain more knowledge through the backing of a new organisation and have more voices in his corner shouting his praise.

Mateschitz approved new Red Bull F1 windtunnel before death, https://the-race.com/formula-1/mateschitz-approved-new-red-bull-f1-windtunnel-before-death/, Red Bull is investing in a new windtunnel as one of the last commitments made by Dietrich Mateschitz to the Formula 1 operation. The windtunnel referred to recently as a relic of the Cold War by Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has limitations with temperature control because of the size and age of the building that houses it. It was one of the commitments that Dietrich made to the business to invest in a new tunnel he said in reference to Red Bull cofounder Mateschitz who died in October. The existing windtunnel came into the spotlight during the Mexican Grand Prix weekend in connection with Red Bulls penalty for breaking F1s budget cap in 2021. In recent years Red Bull and its technical chief Adrian Newey have been strong champions of F1 ditching windtunnels altogether and moving entirely to CFD development., Red Bull is investing in a new windtunnel as one of the last commitments made by Dietrich Mateschitz to the Formula 1 operation. Since Red Bull bought the Jaguar team in 2004 it has used the old Arrows windtunnel which was repurposed for F1 use having existed as an aircraft development facility since first operating as RAE Bedford in 1946. The windtunnel referred to recently as a relic of the Cold War by Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has limitations with temperature control because of the size and age of the building that houses it. It had been reported earlier this year that Red Bull was planning a new windtunnel that would take two years to build and be part of its technology campus in Milton Keynes bringing together all facets of the car and engine design and production in one location. Although it is unclear what stage the project is at Horner has told The Race it will happen. It was one of the commitments that Dietrich made to the business to invest in a new tunnel he said in reference to Red Bull cofounder Mateschitz who died in October. The existing windtunnel came into the spotlight during the Mexican Grand Prix weekend in connection with Red Bulls penalty for breaking F1s budget cap in 2021. It has been hit with a 10 reduction in the aerodynamic testing allowance it is permitted for the next 12 months and Horner said that punishment would be felt hard by Red Bull because of the windtunnels inefficiencies. Mateschitz wielded huge influence on F1 with such subtlety Read more In addition to properly regulating the temperature of the windtunnel Red Bulls takes time getting up to the maximum wind speed that makes for the most reliable measurements. Some of the time taken to reach this speed is also calculated within the testing limitations. The decision to build a new windtunnel was taken well before the budget cap saga even began let alone when the penalty emerged and will not be built until long after Red Bulls penalty has expired. It is an investment made because Red Bull feels its hand was forced by the gradual increase in restrictions on aerodynamic testing which has put an increasing emphasis on efficiency. While it would have preferred to avoid investing in a new tunnel it has effectively decided that in the current era of F1 its current facility is too outdated. Once the tunnel regulations were introduced then the efficiency of our tunnel just wasnt comparable with where the regulations are going said Horner. It forced our hand that we needed to make that big capital investment. Hed set the vision  Red Bulls F1 future without Mateschitz Read more So thats what weve chosen to do. The investment could have a limited value to Red Bull as like McLaren and Aston Martin it is building a new windtunnel at a time F1 has tentatively discussed a ban on windtunnels in 2030. This proposal had initial support from a majority of teams last year but without any real details when it was discussed this is not necessarily indicative of whether it will actually happen. Those who are opposed to the ban see the tunnels as major capital assets that would be a blow for teams to lose. In recent years Red Bull and its technical chief Adrian Newey have been strong champions of F1 ditching windtunnels altogether and moving entirely to CFD development. Horner said When you look at the way the worlds going simulation is playing a bigger and bigger role. We should have been brave enough to look at walking away from tunnels in the future. But unfortunately there was a fearbased culture rather than an embracing one.

More info Sebastian Vettel chose to snub childhood hero Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton when naming the greatest driver to grace Formula One. Vettel who will retire at the end of the season has always favoured Schumacher after growing a close relationship with his German compatriot. Seventime world champion Schumacher was a mentor for Vettel when he first made it onto the F1 grid and the Aston Martin driver has since assumed a similar role for his son Mick as the youngster aims to make his own strides in the sport. But while Vettel has always favoured Schumacher over Brit Hamilton also a seventime title winner he has opted for Juan Manuel Fangio when discussing the greatest ever. Vettel was interacting with a fan at the Mexican Grand Prix and when asked about fivetime champion Fangio the 35yearold gave an emphatic response. Im a fan of Michael Schumacher but Fangio is a little better the best the best the king Vettel said. Fangios motorsport legacy lives on after he dominated F1 in its fledgling years. JUST IN Mercedes explain Lewis Hamilton engine cuts at Mexican GP Vettel has named his F1 GOAT The late Argentine won all five of his titles in the first decade of F1 after its inception in 1950. And Fangio remains the oldest driver ever to win an F1 title after his triumph in 1957. In total the driver nicknamed El Maestro won 24 of the 52 races that he entered. After Vettels assertion one man who will be looking to enter the debate that also includes the great Ayrton Senna is Red Bulls Max Verstappen. The 25yearold is already a multiple world champion and is well on course to being considered in the conversation with such illustrious names at the end of his career. The Dutchman eclipsed Vettel and Schumachers joint record of 13 race wins in a season with a dominant 14th victory of the year in Mexico. Vettel opted for Fangio over Schumacher
David Coulthard joins Mika Hakkinen in making confident Mercedes F1 cost cap claim, https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/mercedes-cost-cap-coulthard-hakkinen-28405159, But Coulthard does not believe the Silver Arrows will be tempted to ignore the cost cap going forward. Lets say McLaren Ferrari and Mercedes all go over the cost cap next year because theyre willing to take a 10 per cent reduction said the Scot. His words echoed those of fellow former racer Mika Hakkinen who described Red Bulls punishment as significant in a blog post. Red Bulls penalty for the minor overspend is still significant. That final point about publicity is exactly what Mercedes chief Toto Wolff said himself when asked for his reaction to Red Bulls penalty in Mexico., Some have questioned whether the punishment received by Red Bull for their overspend during the 2021 season is enough of a deterrent for other teams in the future David Coulthard does not believe Mercedes will risk breaking cost cap rules next year in the wake of Red Bulls punishment for their 2021 overspend. Last month the FIA revealed Red Bull had exceeded the budget cap the previous season by around 1.8m which came down to 432k once a tax credit was applied. As punishment they were fined 6m and will have 10 of their wind tunnel time taken away from them over the next 12 months. Some rivals seemed underwhelmed by that punishment. Mercedes trackside engineering director Andrew Shovlin appeared to be one of them as he baulked at Christian Horners claim that his team gained no competitive advantage from the overspend stressing Money buys performance. But Coulthard does not believe the Silver Arrows will be tempted to ignore the cost cap going forward. Lets say McLaren Ferrari and Mercedes all go over the cost cap next year because theyre willing to take a 10 per cent reduction said the Scot. They wont do it because 10 is 10  nobody wants a 10 reduction. So of course theyre going to say that because the shoe is not on their foot. But as sure as they are in Formula 1 therell be something thats controversial about their team in the future. His words echoed those of fellow former racer Mika Hakkinen who described Red Bulls punishment as significant in a blog post. The FIA recognised that there could be various levels of overspend and reasons for doing so wrote the Finn. Red Bulls penalty for the minor overspend is still significant. Far more than the financial or aerodynamic penalty it has been an uncomfortable experience for the team. Image PA PA The good thing is that no team will want to risk repeating this next year so although it has been a very difficult and controversial moment for Red Bull I believe it will benefit F1 in the long term because every team boss will be determined not to have this kind of negative publicity in future. That final point about publicity is exactly what Mercedes chief Toto Wolff said himself when asked for his reaction to Red Bulls penalty in Mexico. Beyond the sporting penalty and fine there is also reputational damage the Austrian told Sky Sports. In a world of transparency and good governance its just not on any more. Whatever team you are youre responsible for representing a brand your employees and your partners and thats why for us it wouldnt be something they would do.
Ross Chastain gains attention worldwide with Martinsville move, https://nascar.nbcsports.com/2022/11/03/ross-chastain-gains-worldwide-attention-with-martinsville-move/, He did so at the Charlotte Roval and then at Martinsville to earn his spot at Phoenix. Aided a fourtire pit call by Stevens late in the race Bell charged to the win to move into the third round. Again a late fourtire pit call by Stevens helped Bell win to advance to Phoenix. That was the only thing he wanted to do a professional race car driver. So I finally got my little guy and hes wanting to get in a race car., AVONDALE Ariz.  A video game move sent Ross Chastain to the Cup championship race but it was a video game that helped start Christopher Bell on the path to Sundays title event at Phoenix Raceway. A 5yearold Bell was enamored with racing but after his parents bought a junior sprint car and collected sponsorship for it Bells first race almost didnt happen. When it was time to climb into the car for the first time he didnt want to do so. I remember just being super nervous about the situation and not wanting to drive Bell said. But his mother made a deal with him. Ill buy you a Nintendo game if you get in one time Kathy Bell said. Bell got into the car immediately. As soon as I got in I fell in love with it he said recalling the memory more clearly than what Nintendo game he got. After he completed his first practice run he exited the car and ran to his mom. Did you see me hit the wall Yeah. That was so cool Bell never again questioned getting into a car. When Bell climbed from his car after winning last weekend at Martinsville his first words were Mom and Dad we did it Theyll be here at Phoenix to see if their son can win the Cup championship in his first appearance in the title race 3 p.m. ET on NBC and Peacock. When Bell mentioned his parents after the Martinsville race it was as much for the counsel they had provided during the playoffs which have seen him twice fall so far back in the standings he had to win the final race of a round to stay alive. He did so at the Charlotte Roval and then at Martinsville to earn his spot at Phoenix. But the trials and tribulations of the playoffs wore on Bell. The biggest thing that hit me in that moment at Martinsville was they kept telling I was going to do it Bell said of his parents. Youre going to make Phoenix. Youre going to make the Final.  So when I won the race that was the only thing that I could think of my mom and dad were right and we did it we made the Final 4. Bell often keeps his emotions in check so such outbursts are rare but Martinsville was special. As they rode back home after the race last Sunday night Bells wife Morgan was jolted by a sudden exclamation from her husband. Hes in the backseat going through all of his text messages and going through this phone and out of nowhere he just screams at the top of his lungs Morgan told NBC Sports. Bell said it was just the adrenaline that elicited the reaction. It was a big moment winning at Martinsville and advancing where I am today is probably one of my biggest moments of my life Bell told NBC Sports. That just goes back the lowest of lows going into Martinsville and  getting right back to the top. But Bells performance in pressure situations is a trait of the 27yearold from Norman Oklahoma. He has always been very very good under extreme pressure Bells father David told NBC Sports. David Bell saw it when he coached his son in youth basketball and their team played in the finals. While the team lost Bells performance stood out his father recalls. It carried through Bells dirt racing experience. He won the Belleville Nationals midget race in 2013 and won the Chili Bowl Nationals in 2017 18 and 19. He also won the Camping World Truck Series title in 2017 and made the Xfinity Series championship race in 2018 and 19. He faced more pressure Friday at Phoenix when practice didnt go as well  he was 20th on the speed chart. It was as if the team had the rest of the field right where they wanted. Thats right crew chief Adam Stevens said with a smile. Were just setting the trap. Bell starts Sundays race 17th. With the way these playoffs have gone for him its not surprising he would face challenges in the finale. After a first round that saw him be the only playoff driver to score topfive finishes in each of those three races things have been much more difficult. He blew a tire on two different occasions at Texas the second such incident causing him to hit the wall. At Talladega he spun and was penalized for speeding on pit road putting him in a mustwin situation at the Charlotte Roval. Aided a fourtire pit call by Stevens late in the race Bell charged to the win to move into the third round. Bell called that the defining moment of his season to this point. I think that really says a lot about our team because it would have been very easy to give up going into the Roval which we knew was not going to be a great race for us Bell said noting the struggles of Toyotas on road courses this season. As it turned out it was not a great race. We were back half of the top 10 car. The yellow flag came out and we were able to perform how we needed to perform to win. Those good feelings didnt last. Problems returned the following week at Texas in the opening race of the Round of 8. When Bubba Wallace retaliated and wrecked Kyle Larson Bell was hit by Larsons car and was done for the race. A week later Bell finished 11th at Homestead. He entered Martinsville 33 points out of the final transfer spot. Again a late fourtire pit call by Stevens helped Bell win to advance to Phoenix. Im fully aware that I have the right guy on the pit box absolutely Bell said. This is just as Bell pictured when he was a child. He never wavered Kathy Bell said of her sons desire to race. That was the only thing he wanted to do a professional race car driver. His dad said You need a Plan B son but he never got a Plan B. Kathy admits she didnt want her son to race but that changed one day. I was just praying about him Kathy said. We had two older girls and I had wanted this little guy forever. So I finally got my little guy and hes wanting to get in a race car. I really didnt want him to do that. I was praying about it.  I heard clear as a bell this is my destiny for him. So I gave in and Dave said lets do it. So we let him start racing.

Nikita Mazepin has surprise new career after his F1 hopes went up in flames, https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/nikita-mazepin-career-now-dj-28404414, But Haas quickly made the decision to cut ties with both Mazepin and sponsor Uralkali the company owned by his oligarch father. Perhaps aware he will struggle to find another drive in motorsport it appears Mazepin has turned his attention to other ventures. After one of the photos was shared across social media some F1 fans couldnt resist poking fun at the Russian. Mazepin has previously suggested he could one day return to F1  but not with Haas after accusing team principal Guenther Steiner of lacking human qualities. I think one day I will be in F1 as a businessman but there is no hurry., Mazepin managed just one season in Formula 1 with Haas before he was unceremoniously sacked by the team in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February Nikita Mazepin has surprise new career after his F1 hopes went up in flames Nikita Mazepin looks to have embarked on a new career as an events planner after being axed from Formula 1. The Russian racer made his F1 debut with Haas but failed to score a single point during the 2021 season as the team fielded two entirely uncompetitive cars. He was set to be given a second crack alongside Mick Schumacher this year but things changed after Russia launched their invasion of Ukraine. The FIA made it clear drivers from Russia would still be allowed to compete provided they did not represent their country and did not voice any support of their countrys belligerence. But Haas quickly made the decision to cut ties with both Mazepin and sponsor Uralkali the company owned by his oligarch father. Perhaps aware he will struggle to find another drive in motorsport it appears Mazepin has turned his attention to other ventures. His latest seems to be an event planning firm called The Ninety Nine Events which threw a big Halloweenthemed bash this week. Photos published on his Instagram account show partygoers in fancy dress enjoying themselves in front of a large screen with Mazepins surname displayed in large letters. Another snap shows the former racer wearing headphones while operating DJ decks. This year I had to say goodbye to Formula 1 for a while he wrote in the caption. But in order to open up to something different it is important to come to terms with setbacks and trouble. If one path for selfexpression is closed then you need to look for another. For the first time I come before you in such a role. Its great that you can discover new frontiers and find opportunities for development in your own projects. After one of the photos was shared across social media some F1 fans couldnt resist poking fun at the Russian. Cant spin a car anymore so hes spinning tracks instead wrote one in reference to the Mazespin nickname he was given by some over his habit of losing control of his car during his one and only F1 season. He probably crashed the computer he was playing the music on joked another. Mazepin has previously suggested he could one day return to F1  but not with Haas after accusing team principal Guenther Steiner of lacking human qualities. He said When a team boss behaves like that then I think there are nine other teams with whom I can have a dialogue. I think one day I will be in F1 as a businessman but there is no hurry.

Ralf Schumacher suggests Haas could drop Magnussen for 2023, https://racingnews365.com/ralf-schumacher-suggests-haas-could-drop-magnussen-for-2023, However sixtime Grand Prix winner Ralf has suggested that Haas might be better advised to retain Schumacher and replace Magnussen with Hulkenberg. Ralf Schumacher has suggested that the Haas Formula 1 team could potentially drop Kevin Magnussen for the 2023 season. Schumacher on MagnussenWith Mick Schumacher is his second F1 season he has come in for criticism for a number of unforced errors with heavy shunts in Jeddah Monaco and Suzuka drawing a public rebuke from Steiner. Speaking to Sky Germany Ralf Schumacher points to this upturn in form as a case for retaining Mick Schumacher. As of the Mexican Grand Prix Magnussen has 24 points and is 13th in the Drivers Championship while Schumachers tally of 12 puts him 16th in the standings., However sixtime Grand Prix winner Ralf has suggested that Haas might be better advised to retain Schumacher and replace Magnussen with Hulkenberg. One of the final seats on the grid for next season is currently available at Haas with it expected to go to either incumbent Mick Schumacher  Ralfs nephew  or Nico Hulkenberg with Kevin Magnussen already on a multiyear deal with the team. Ralf Schumacher has suggested that the Haas Formula 1 team could potentially drop Kevin Magnussen for the 2023 season. Schumacher on Magnussen With Mick Schumacher is his second F1 season he has come in for criticism for a number of unforced errors with heavy shunts in Jeddah Monaco and Suzuka drawing a public rebuke from Steiner. However his form improved partway through the season with strong points finishes at the British and Austrian Grands Prix helping his case for staying in the sport. Speaking to Sky Germany Ralf Schumacher points to this upturn in form as a case for retaining Mick Schumacher. Anything is possible of course especially if we look at the last few races said Schumacher. Who knows Magnussen may not be so firmly in the seat anymore. If we look at the races since Silverstone we have to conclude that Mick is the more stable and better of the two drivers  and who has also had some bad luck with wrong strategies. In the last race Mexcio Mick was sometimes up to sixtenths faster than Magnussen  so lets wait and see for the next few races. I hope Haas make a decision soon. Maybe next year we will have two Germans on the Formula 1 grid. Since the British GP in July Schumacher has finished more races ahead of Magnussen than vice versa  five vs four when both cars finished  although the Dane has scored points more often. As of the Mexican Grand Prix Magnussen has 24 points and is 13th in the Drivers Championship while Schumachers tally of 12 puts him 16th in the standings.
Why Formula 1's overseer was right to penalise Red Bull, https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/11/03/why-formula-1s-overseer-was-right-to-penalise-red-bull, In 2021 the FIA introduced a cap on teams spending to try to increase competition on the grid. In that year the big prize the drivers championship was won in controversial circumstances by Max Verstappen while his team Red Bull came second in the constructors competition. Several weeks ago the FIA announced that Red Bull had breached the spending cap that season. Red Bull reacted furiously insisting it had complied with the rules. Zak Brown chief executive of McLaren accused Red Bull of cheating and demanded financial and sporting penalties., AS MANY PARENTS know to their cost empty threats are woefully ineffective. Once children twig that mum or dad is unwilling to follow through with the denial of pocket money or confinement to the house authority is lost. The lesson is a useful one for sporting authorities too. One that seems to have learned it is the Fdration Internationale de lAutomobile  FIA  the governing body of Formula 1 motor racing. And one that needs to is UEFA  which supposedly rules over European football. In 2021 the FIA introduced a cap on teams spending to try to increase competition on the grid. Constructors were limited to spending 145m on research and development and on building and testing cars. Other expenses such as drivers salaries and marketing were exempt. In that year the big prize the drivers championship was won in controversial circumstances by Max Verstappen while his team Red Bull came second in the constructors competition. Several weeks ago the FIA announced that Red Bull had breached the spending cap that season. The breachspending up to 5 above the capwas the second most serious of the four categories. The Aston Martin team was also found to be in breach but in a lesser procedural category. Red Bull reacted furiously insisting it had complied with the rules. Its rivals were furious too. Zak Brown chief executive of McLaren accused Red Bull of cheating and demanded financial and sporting penalties. When the FIA handed down Red Bulls punishment at the end of October it predictably satisfied no one. It fined the team 7m a good deal more than the sum by which it had overspent and cut the amount of time it will be allowed to spend on aerodynamic testing over the next 12 months by 10. Red Bulls boss Christian Horner called the penalties draconian and complained that the reduction in windtunnel time would hurt his teams competitiveness. Meanwhile his counterpart at Mercedes Toto Wolff said that the punishment was too little. Yet having tightened its rules the FIA acted in the only way that made senseeven if people on either side might grumble that it was too severe or too lenient. The weakness of its counterpart in European football provides a contrasting and cautionary tale. A decade ago with Europes big clubs spending ever more on players some of them recklessly UEFA drew up financial fair play  FFP  rules. It declared that teams annual expenditure on player transfers and wages should not exceed revenues from broadcasting ticket and commercial activities by more than 5m then 5.7m. Two of Europes most wellheeled clubs Paris St Germain and Manchester City which are both financed by petrodollars were soon investigated for suspected breaches. In both cases UEFA was concerned that the clubs outlays on players could not be justified by their income which appeared to have been inflated by sponsorship deals with companies linked to their Middle Eastern owners. Yet in 2018 UEFA concluded that PSGs deals just about complied with the rules. To reach this conclusion UEFA accepted valuations assessed by firms hired by the club rather than the much lower sums proposed by analysts commissioned by the governing body itself. UEFA did ban Manchester City from European competition for two years and fined the club 30mbut the next year the Court of Arbitration for Sport the highest legal body in sport overturned the ban and cut the fine to 10m not enough to buy a secondrate centrehalf. That wasnt because the CAS found that City had kept to the rules but because UEFA had taken too long to investigate. FFP became a laughing stock. It was quietly scrapped and in mid2022 was replaced with new regulations. By the middle of the decade clubs will have to limit spending on wages transfers and agents to 70 of revenue. This will mean big changes to the business models of many clubs. But the effectiveness of the regulations will depend entirely on UEFA s appetite for bringing transgressors to heel. UEFA may fear that if it tries to be harsh big clubs will set up their own competitions as they have previously threatened to do.

Step Aside Lewis Hamilton Formula 1 Has Entered the Max Verstappen Era, https://www.autoweek.com/racing/formula-1/a41854877/step-aside-lewis-hamilton-formula-1-has-entered-the-max-verstappen-era/, Haas F1 team principal Guenther Steiner says that F1 has turned the page on Lewis Hamilton and its now the Max Verstappen era. Modern Formula 1 has gone from the Michael Schumacher era to the Sebastian Vettel era to Lewis Hamilton era to a new era according to Haas F1 team principal Guenther Steiner. Steiner says welcome to the Max Verstappen era. In this era its just Max Steiner told the German broadcaster NTV. Formula has a new king of the mountain and its Max Verstappen., Haas F1 team principal Guenther Steiner says that F1 has turned the page on Lewis Hamilton and its now the Max Verstappen era. Verstappen follows the dynasties of Michael Schumacher seven championships Sebastian Vettel four championships and Hamilton seven championships. Red Bull consultant Dr. Helmut Marko says it might be to early to pencil in Verstappen for a long run of championships. Modern Formula 1 has gone from the Michael Schumacher era to the Sebastian Vettel era to Lewis Hamilton era to a new era according to Haas F1 team principal Guenther Steiner. Steiner says welcome to the Max Verstappen era. Although the 2021 season finale and this years budget cap scandal muddied Verstappens achievements Steiner says the Verstappen era is similar to the Hamilton Vettel and Schumacher eras that preceded it. Every era has its champion. In this era its just Max Steiner told the German broadcaster NTV. We are right in the middle of that era now. Hes got the talent the drive hes just a master at the moment. Formula has a new king of the mountain and its Max Verstappen. NurPhoto Getty Images As for who might challenge Verstappens superiority next year Steiner answered I think Charles Leclercs driving skills are very good at the moment. But sometimes he still makes mistakesa little too many mistakes. And Max just doesnt make them anywhere. Steiner also believes that seventime world champion Lewis Hamilton is still good. Max however is the man now. To be champion you need that little bit extra. A certain coolness a certain extra bit of luck too Steiner said. Max is just riding a wave at the moment and he doesnt want to get off it. Some however say Verstappens dominance is already boring. Take the cakewalk Verstappen had in Mexico where only two cars were within 49 seconds of him at the finish. When asked about that Red Bull consultant Dr. Helmut Marko told Osterreich Unfortunately we cant take that into account. For the rest Max delivers anything but boring races. In Austria for example his races are rewarded with top ratings. Marko though doesnt expect Verstappens current level of dominance to carry over into 2023. We approach the matter realistically said the 79yearold Austrian. It is indeed amazing how the season has turned out. You couldnt have predicted that Max would be in such form. Unfortunately its not enough for the 19 wins in one season Marko added referring to Mercedes win total as a team in 2016. When told that Red Bull could target that for 2023 Marko answered I hardly think its possible for everything to fit together like this for another season. However Max has not yet reached the end of his development. He is even more mature faster tirefriendly. Theres still incredible room for improvement.
Sainz praises Verstappen for ‘evolving in every single area’ en route to successive F1 world titles, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.sainz-praises-verstappen-for-evolving-in-every-single-area-en-route-to.56ZsXtiPQr8uRsNKgKkPej.html, Carlos Sainz has added to the words of praise sent in Max Verstappens direction after the Dutchman secured his second F1 title noting how much he believes his former team mate has improved over the years. Verstappen made his F1 debut alongside Sainz at Toro Rosso back in 2015 the two drivers spending just over a season together before the Dutchman secured promotion to the senior Red Bull team and embarked on a winning journey. Since then Verstappen has racked up 19 pole positions 34 victories and his aforementioned backtoback championships while Sainz has found a new home at Ferrari  leading to plenty more battles between the pair this time at the front of the F1 field.

Room for one more F1 race in the Americas says Mexican GP promoter, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/room-for-one-more-f1-race-in-the-americas-says-mexican-gp-promoter/10394392/, With grands prix also taking place in Canada and Brazil there will be six races in the Americas in 2023. So I think thats good for the region for the timezone that is very good. So with Canada three races in the United States Mexico and Brazil the question is if there room for another one Its a great show and a great window to present Mexico in a good fashion to the world. I would rather to have a race every other year than have no race at all., Listen to this article Last weekends race at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez in Mexico City attracted a sellout crowd of 397000 fans over three days once again making it one of the bestattended races of the season. The continued strong fan presence in Mexico comes amid F1s current boom in the neighbouring United States which will host three races next year in Miami Austin and Las Vegas. With grands prix also taking place in Canada and Brazil there will be six races in the Americas in 2023. But amid continued interest from countries in hosting a grand prix in the future Alejandro Soberon the chief executive of CIE that promotes the race in Mexico felt there would be scope to add another event in the Americas. We love competition its good because it keeps you in shape and alert said Soberon. Three races in the States before it was unthinkable. Today it even looks reasonable. I think Miami is going to be a very big success. You saw the attendance in Austin. Its much better than other years its a stronger race. And all the presales in Vegas are through the roof. So I think thats good for the region for the timezone that is very good. So with Canada three races in the United States Mexico and Brazil the question is if there room for another one My personal belief is there is room for another one. But it doesnt have to go against another race in the same timezone. It can go against another timezone. So whos going to be at risk how competitive is that offer Its going to be very interesting. Lance Stroll Aston Martin waves to the crowd on the drivers parade Photo by Sam Bloxham  Motorsport Images Mexico announced on Thursday that it had signed a new threeyear contract ensuring F1 will continue to visit the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez until at least 2025. But Soberon explained that come the next renewal there could be a new government and city mayor in place following the elections in 2024. Mexico initially returned to the calendar in 2015 with a deal that was funded by the federal government but a change in the government meant the Mexico City mayor and her administration took over securing the funding for the race for the existing deal and the renewal. Soberon felt confident the grand prix would continue to get national support regardless of the ruling bodies believing everyone in the country was very proud about the race. They love Checo Perez what hes achieving said Soberon. Its a great show and a great window to present Mexico in a good fashion to the world. Today there are more and more cities interested in getting a slot on the calendar. I think that basically means that everybody needs to move faster trying to make the alliance of interest to make it happen because I think Formula 1 is in a great position today. F1 will hold a recordbreaking 24race season in 2023 reaching the limit set out by the Concorde Agreement after adding a new event in Las Vegas as well as bringing China and Qatar back to the schedule. Series bosses are known to be exploring calendar rotation as a potential way to ensure more markets particularly those in Europe can hold events every other year. Asked about the possibility of Mexico rotating in the future if required Soberon said When you have every year sold out and every year you sell it faster than the year before its something as a promoter you dont want to consider. Why should I have every other year a race when I can have one every year Im very competitive I deliver good dollars to Formula 1 and its a great market the Mexican market has a lot to do with the success in the States. The Hispanic population is very fond of races there. But you know for some countries that cannot manage to have the right funding certainly its going to be an option to do. I would rather to have a race every other year than have no race at all.
Additional U.S. F1 races good for Mexican GP promoter believes, https://racer.com/2022/11/03/additional-u-s-f1-races-good-for-mexican-gp-promoter-believes/, The expansion of the Formula 1 calendar with three races in the United States has been a positive move for the Mexico City Grand Prix according to the races promoter Alejandro Soberon. Mexico City rejoined the F1 schedule in 2015 three years after Circuit of The Americas returned the sport to the USA after an absence of five years. So I think thats good for the region for the time zone its very good. And everybody knows its a good race its a great experience. Mexico City is a very interesting city to come and do more things than the race., The expansion of the Formula 1 calendar with three races in the United States has been a positive move for the Mexico City Grand Prix according to the races promoter Alejandro Soberon. Mexico City rejoined the F1 schedule in 2015 three years after Circuit of The Americas returned the sport to the USA after an absence of five years. Since then interest in the States has grown to the point where there will be three events in 2023 but Soberon  the CEO and president of race promoter Corporacion Interamericana de Entretenimiento CIE  says theres even space for another race in the region. Im not sure about Central America but three races in the States before it was a challenge now it even looks reasonable Soberon said. I think Miamis going to be a very big success you saw the attendance in Austin is much better than other years so its a stronger race in Austin and all the presales in Vegas are through the roof. So I think thats good for the region for the time zone its very good. Canada three races in the U.S. Mexico and Brazil. The question is is there room for another one My personal view is there is room for another one but it doesnt have to go against another race in the same time zone. It can go against another time zone. We have many clients of ours who went to Miami. They loved Miami and they loved the race in Miami but they came back and they secured their tickets in Mexico and said Being there was great probably I will go back but I love my race. Soberon says the higher ticket prices in America also help to make Mexico City a viable alternative option to U.S.based F1 fans. On the contrary that more American races hurt sales because when you compare the price and the packaging to come here were very competitive. And everybody knows its a good race its a great experience. Mexico City is a very interesting city to come and do more things than the race. Then maybe instead of taking three days you take a week and come and see the restaurants and the culture in the city and interesting places. So it becomes beyond a race  it goes deeper than that. A further race in the Americas has been mooted in Colombia after a visit to Barranquilla by F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali earlier this week although RACER understands that is one of just many meetings that the sport has lined up due to the level of interest in new host venues wanting to join the calendar.
Ricciardo has felt like "a passenger" at times amid McLaren F1 struggles, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/ricciardo-has-felt-like-a-passenger-at-times-amid-mclaren-f1-struggles/10394511/, Ricciardo admitted that it was the first time he had felt so comfortable with the 2022 car. Not to be negative I dont even want to look ahead I just want to take today for what it is. So just to have an attacking race and especially for me with this car to feel like I can attack a little bit more with it its just a nice feeling. So thats where its just I felt a little bit helpless at times. But Ill take today and enjoy it and Im happy weve got a week off so I can enjoy it for a week., Listen to this article The Australian put in his best performance of the year in Mexico City last weekend using a successful mediumsoft tyre strategy that gave him the pace with which to charge up to seventh place  while negating a 10second penalty for colliding with Yuki Tsunoda. The race came just a week after one of Ricciardos most disappointing outings of the season in Austin where he finished a lowly 16th 10 places behind teammate Lando Norris. Ricciardo admitted that it was the first time he had felt so comfortable with the 2022 car. I guess better late than never he said. Im going to take today for what it is Im going to enjoy it and appreciate that we did our pace and it was awesome and whatever. I hope it means that itll be like that the next two races. Not to be negative I dont even want to look ahead I just want to take today for what it is. And hopefully weve learned something from it. Even the points finishes even probably last year I feel we were normally defending rather than attacking. So just to have an attacking race and especially for me with this car to feel like I can attack a little bit more with it its just a nice feeling. He said that it was good to bounce back in style after feeling so frustrated after the US race. Of course its not typical in a place like Austin for me to feel like that he said after the flag in Mexico. Theres so much about that weekend that I love. So it has to be pretty bad for me to feel like that in a place like that. Its just theres been a lot of times where Ive felt a little bit like a passenger in a way I just feel like Ive worked with such little grip that no amount of talent is going to get the job done if you know what I mean. So thats where its just I felt a little bit helpless at times. So you feel like you cant show really anything that youve got because youre just not operating on the level of the others. So today to kind of be able to at least lean on it and push and have pace and be a guy thats setting quick times makes me happy. I wish it could have been like this more often. But Ill take today and enjoy it and Im happy weve got a week off so I can enjoy it for a week. Asked by Motorsport.com if he felt that hed proved a point Ricciardo said I still know I can get the job done its hard when you cant do it week in and week out. Its a bit like Sebastian Vettel those last few races he did phenomenal races and then people are questioning is it time to retire I think all of us can still do it on our day. Obviously its just the consistency for whatever reason. But I still love it. And I still want to get to the front.

TREMAYNE: Mercedes’ resurgence means we could be in for a thrilling end to 2022, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.tremayne-mercedes-resurgence-means-we-could-be-in-for-a-thrilling-end-to.32wqr9ZB34HSn5Qb8mWAvY.html, But perhaps its even more significant that the question in the aftermath was whether Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes should have won. Lewis Hamilton finished second at Mexico but should he have gone one better Both Mercedes started on the medium tyres while the Red Bulls were on the softs  did that call cost Hamilton victory Thats one of the delicious conundrums now that the championship titles have been settled in Max and Red Bulls favour. Hamilton believes the ability to hold on to Verstappen in the first stint was a clear sign of Mercedes progress, The very fact that wed all been discussing on Sunday morning whether Mercedes could win the Mexico City Grand Prix is a sign of just how much progress they have made in recent races. But perhaps its even more significant that the question in the aftermath was whether Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes should have won. One of the abiding questions which may be answered in the upcoming final races of the 2022 season in Brazil and Abu Dhabi is whether the upturn in performance was trackspecific. READ MORE We know where we need to improve says Hamilton after P2 in Mexico The previous week at the Circuit of The Americas where Lewis has always excelled and Mercedes final upgrade of the year seemed beneficial the Red Bull still simply had too much pace. This time however the peculiarities of the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez appeared to deal the Silver Arrows a very strong hand just like it used to do to Red Bull in their highrake preground effect days. In the runup team boss Toto Wolff said On paper Mexico looks good our draggy car should be effective in the thin air. I hope we can give them a run for their money. Lewis Hamilton finished second at Mexico but should he have gone one better The track the thirdshortest circuit on the 2022 F1 calendar is 7350ft above sea level. Thats the highest of any and that altitude and the low air density in Mexico City is less efficient at cooling hot things such as power units and brakes and if teams arent careful their maximised cooling arrangements can play havoc with the aerodynamics. The ambient pressure is easily the lowest of the season and this too has a significant impact on things such as a power units breathing and performance and also affects downforce. The paradox is that while teams run their highest levels  exactly what they would round the streets of Monaco or the Hungaroring where top speed matters much less than cornering force  the cars still top out at close to 225 mph down the Mexican tracks long front straight. DRIVER MARKET Hamilton targeting multiyear contract renewal with Mercedes So Mercedes were hopeful that their aerodynamically draggy W13 might have a performance advantage in these odd conditions and so it seemed. George Russell topped the third and final practice session on Saturday before Lewis set the fastest times in the first two segments of qualifying. In the third which decides the first five rows of the grid he had his first run time deleted for a track limits violation and thus had to be very slightly more circumspect on his second to make sure of setting a time. As Max Verstappen set yet another pole position for Red Bull George was second and Lewis third just fivethousandths of a second slower than his team mate after an engine glitch. Both Mercedes drivers believed they could have been on pole. The auguries for the race thus seemed positive. Russell and Hamilton finished behind Verstappen in qualifying but both felt they missed an opportunity at pole And while Lewis always says he isnt interested in records he is currently still the only world champion ever to have won a race in each of his years in F1 and in his heart he would like to maintain that one. But now that the US and Mexico lie behind us only two opportunities remain and both would appear in different ways to favour Red Bull and perhaps Ferrari who had an appalling time in Mexico. So what went wrong for the Silver Arrows Why did Lewis finish 15.186s adrift of Max further back than in America And George fourth albeit with fastest lap Lewis said he suggested starting on the soft Pirelli tyres in the race morning strategy meeting and that when the tyre warmers came off the cars on the grid and he saw that the Red Bulls were on that compound his heart sank. I thought shoot he said using one of his favourite expressions because he and George were on the medium tyres Mercedes boffins believing that they would last longer than the softs in the first stint. READ MORE Russell takes positives from Mercedes performance despite frustrating P4 finish at Mexico City GP That would give Mercedes cars track position when Max and Sergio Perez had to make earlier pit stops to change to mediums and that when they switched their own cars to the hardcompound rubber it would pay off in the run to the finish as Red Bulls mediums wore out sooner. It was a mistake because the performance of the mediums didnt drop off and Wolff readily admitted it afterwards. The softs did well early on and when Sergio was the first to stop having shadowed Lewis after the latter had battled past George in the third corner after the start and then himself jumped the younger Briton Mercedes were obliged to cover him by stopping Lewis sooner than they had intended. Both Mercedes started on the medium tyres while the Red Bulls were on the softs  did that call cost Hamilton victory George meanwhile ever prepared to speak out for what he wants and believes in didnt want to stop so soon but was only allowed to stay out another five laps. McLarens Daniel Ricciardo stayed out until Lap 45 on his medium then switched to softs for the final 26 laps and electrified his fading career with a very strong run to seventh indicating the strategy that might have been better for Mercedes. The Red Bulls especially Maxs performed perfectly to the end on their mediums whereas both Mercedes drivers understood within laps of taking them that the hards had been a big mistake. READ MORE Wolff satisfied with rigourous Cost Cap process as Shovlin calls Horners draconian penalty claim an exaggeration So thats the most likely reason why Mercedes didnt win when perhaps they might have been able to had they wrested track position away from Max early in the race by running the same softmedium tyre strategy. But there was also the sneaking feeling that Red Bull still had a slight performance edge. Some days you get it right some you dont. Thats racing and Mercs boffins believed they were taking a worthwhile gamble. Hindsight after all is 2020 vision. Daniel Ricciardo went long on the mediums before switching to the softs which is what George Russell had suggested As it was Mercedes thrashed the Ferraris which looked woeful as they had to turn their engines down all weekend to maintain sensible temperatures. But does this all mean that Mercedes will be in the fight with their two rivals in the final races Thats one of the delicious conundrums now that the championship titles have been settled in Max and Red Bulls favour. TECH TUESDAY Why Mercedes experimental front wing caused a stir in Texas Lewis was adamant that being able to keep up with Max in the first stint  despite their different tyre compounds  and to keep Sergio behind him throughout was a clear indication that they have made a significant performance jump. And from the way he and George spoke afterwards they both clearly expect it to be similarly beneficial in Brazil and Abu Dhabi. Just how beneficial remains to be seen however. So many positives to take from this weekend Lewis said. And this is definitely the most competitive and the best the car has felt all year  and that is truly down to the amazing work from all the women and men back at the factory who have just been doing such an amazing job. And not giving up. Hamilton believes the ability to hold on to Verstappen in the first stint was a clear sign of Mercedes progress

Mercedes would prefer F1 race win over second in constructors' standings, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/mercedes-would-prefer-f1-race-win-over-second-in-constructors-standings/10394378/, But its consistency allied to recent improvements has left it in contention to overhaul Ferrari for second place in the teams battle behind Red Bull. Mercedes is currently lying in third place in the overall standings 40 points behind its Maranello rival. The win would be proof that our car is back to fight for wins he said when asked why he felt that way. P2 could also be because the others dropped the ball and youre just scoring more points.Lewis Hamilton took another second place behind Max Verstappen as Red Bull scored a ninth consecutive victory in Mexico. We are racing for a win racing for both cars on the podium the Ferraris are behind us., The German manufacturer has endured a challenging 2022 campaign and despite having got one pole position this year is at risk of not winning a race for the first time since 2011. But its consistency allied to recent improvements has left it in contention to overhaul Ferrari for second place in the teams battle behind Red Bull. Mercedes is currently lying in third place in the overall standings 40 points behind its Maranello rival. While the runnerup slot would be a good end result to a year that started with such difficulties Wolff says that he would actually prefer it to round off the season with a victory rather than stepping up a world constructors championship position. The win would be proof that our car is back to fight for wins he said when asked why he felt that way. P2 could also be because the others dropped the ball and youre just scoring more points. Lewis Hamilton took another second place behind Max Verstappen as Red Bull scored a ninth consecutive victory in Mexico. Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images While Wolff would not be against overtaking Ferrari in the points table he says that the better judge of the teams progress is how its car is performing on track. It would definitely be some consolation because Ferrari had the quickest car at the beginning of the season he said about the runnerup spot. Finishing ahead of them would be great but again its not our main priority. The main priority is to understand the car and have a quick automobile on the track. Mercedes had two of its best chances of the year to grab that win in the recent United States and Mexican Grands Prix but tyre strategy choices compromised its chances on both occasions. However considering the scale of the problems that the team faced at the beginning of the season Wolff is happy about the level of progress made  even though there are tinges of disappointment about the Austin and Mexico chances that got away. The thing is we are racers and the moment we can kind of see it in front of us we just want to grab it he said. Therefore there is always a sense of frustration. But we have come from such a long way and here we are. We are racing for a win racing for both cars on the podium the Ferraris are behind us. So you need to stay humble and of what we achieved while still reaching for the stars. Photo by Steve Etherington  Motorsport Images Mercedes feels it has a good understanding of what went wrong with its W13 this year and what needs addressing for 2023 as it looks poised to switch concept. However Wolff says there can be no complacency that the changes that are planned will guarantee it being back at the front of the field. Im never confident he said. I always see the glass half empty. So there is nothing to really see it positive. Ive just heard nine wins in a row for Red Bull so there is no reason to be overwhelmed with finishing second and fourth. We have a long way to catch up. We have the winter. I think were doing some good development on the car. Some of the things we are finding might be bigger steps than just adding a few steps of downforce. But were giving it whatever we have and more in order to bring us back into the position to fight for a championship.
Bottas to make Race of Champions debut alongside Hakkinen in 2023, https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1016187/1/bottas-make-race-champions-debut-alongside-hakkinen-2023, The 10time grand prix winner will participate in the 2023 iteration driving for Team Finland in the ROC Nations Cup January 28 alongside twotime F1 champion and fellow Finn Mika Hakkinen. Bottas will also drive in the individual Race of Champions on January 29. Im also thrilled to be able to partner Mika Hakkinen for Team Finland in the ROC Nations Cup. Then well have to put our friendship aside again and try to beat each other in the individual Race Of Champions. I might tell Valtteri before the ROC Nations Cup but only if he promises to have forgotten it by the individual race the next day, Bottas was set to make his debut at the 2022 event but was forced to withdraw days before it started. The 10time grand prix winner will participate in the 2023 iteration driving for Team Finland in the ROC Nations Cup January 28 alongside twotime F1 champion and fellow Finn Mika Hakkinen. Bottas will also drive in the individual Race of Champions on January 29. F1 retiree Sebastian Vettel and threetime W Series champion Jamie Chadwick are also confirmed for the event. Speaking of the news Bottas said Im really looking forward to being able to make my Race Of Champions debut at last. Ive watched the event on TV for many years and I came so close to competing last year until I had to pull out at the last minute. It was tough watching everyone having so much fun throwing their cars around on the snow and ice in Sweden so Im glad I will now be joining them at Pite Havsbad in January. Im also thrilled to be able to partner Mika Hakkinen for Team Finland in the ROC Nations Cup. I have become good friends with Mika over the years but it will be a special treat to be able to race alongside him. Weve both taken part in the Arctic Rally a few times so hopefully that can help us beat our Nordic neighbours  and everyone else. Then well have to put our friendship aside again and try to beat each other in the individual Race Of Champions. Whatever happens Im sure we will put on a great show for all the fans watching at the track and around the world. Hakkinen added Its great that Valtteri will be joining us at the Race Of Champions in January. I was expecting to pair up with him for Team Finland last year so all I can say is better late than never I can assure him the Race Of Champions really is as fun as it looks and to race on the snow and ice is brilliant. As we both grew up in about the only country thats even colder than Pite Havsbad we should have a chance. As for the secret to success I might tell Valtteri before the ROC Nations Cup but only if he promises to have forgotten it by the individual race the next day
What's going on with Piastri's Alpine F1 exit?, https://the-race.com/formula-1/whats-going-on-with-piastris-alpine-f1-exit/, It is believed that having initially continued to conduct simulator work and race weekend support for Alpine at Enstone after the summer break Piastri has been stood down from those duties. However he has not been formally released from the team as this would allow him to join up with McLaren early and potentially even run in the postseason Abu Dhabi test. Alpine was not thought to be keen to facilitate that so instead Piastri has effectively been parked. In Mexico last weekend Alpine team boss Otmar Szafnauer answered carefully when asked by The Race about Piastris status but said I think our legal teams are discussing that now. Its a discussion between Oscar his team and Alpine., Oscar Piastri has been conspicuous in his absence from the public eye in Formula 1 since his rejection of Alpine in favour of a McLaren move was ratified by Formula 1s Contract Recognition Board. Piastri has been Alpines reserve driver this year as part of a programme that the Renault works team envisaged would eventually lead him to take a race seat in the future. However as Piastri and his camp did not want to go along with Alpines plan to loan him out to Williams for 2023 and 2024 a deal with McLaren was done in secret early in the summer. Alpine tried to block that move by arguing it had a valid contract with Piastri but the CRB ruled otherwise leading McLaren to formally announce Piastri as a race driver in place of Daniel Ricciardo in 2023. That came on the Dutch Grand Prix weekend in early September but Piastri has not been in the F1 paddock since he publicly rejected Alpines claim he would drive for the team in 2023 in early August. It is believed that having initially continued to conduct simulator work and race weekend support for Alpine at Enstone after the summer break Piastri has been stood down from those duties. However he has not been formally released from the team as this would allow him to join up with McLaren early and potentially even run in the postseason Abu Dhabi test. Alpine was not thought to be keen to facilitate that so instead Piastri has effectively been parked. An update on his future could come soon though. In Mexico last weekend Alpine team boss Otmar Szafnauer answered carefully when asked by The Race about Piastris status but said I think our legal teams are discussing that now. Therell be more next week. So ask me in Brazil. Doohan had more nerves chasing Alpine seat than FP1 debut Read more Jack Doohan is a logical alternative to Piastri to become Alpines reserve driver fulltime in 2023. Doohan is set to be racing in F2 again but has completed 2021 F1 car testing in private this year made his FP1 debut in Mexico and will drive again on the Friday in Abu Dhabi. Szafnauer confirmed Doohan is also among the options for a reserve role but said we havent made that decision yet. Though there is no official news yet Doohan is likely to take part in the postseason Abu Dhabi test alongside incoming Alpine driver Pierre Gasly who has been signed to take the vacant Fernando Alonso seat that the team initially wanted Piastri to fill. Reports in Spanish media have also suggested Alonso is free to drive for his new team Aston Martin in the postseason test while Gaslys AlphaTauri replacement Nyck de Vries could drive there too. The only 2023 signing not currently expected to drive for their new team in the test is Piastri although McLaren team principal Andreas Seidl would not confirm that either way in Mexico. Theres not really an update from our side he said. Its a discussion between Oscar his team and Alpine. And no updates for the moment.

Lewis Hamilton and George Russell managed to split the Red Bull cars during qualifying at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez raising hopes that they could push polesitter Max Verstappen for victory.

Lewis Hamilton and George Russell managed to split the Red Bull cars during qualifying at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez raising hopes that they could push polesitter Max Verstappen for victory. However alternate tyre strategies between the two teams played out in Red Bulls favour with Verstappen executing his race on a more aggressive softmedium approach while the Mercedes pair used mediums and hards.

Asked if Mercedes should have been braver with their strategy on race day in Mexico Wolff pushed back saying No. In hindsight its always easier to judge but I think the onestop medium to hard looked like the right strategy. The car has really taken a step forward  Hamilton pleased with P2 in Mexico as Mercedes close in on Red Bull That the medium at the end held on for so long came as a surprise but hindsight is a thing. If we were to restart the race maybe we would choose a different tyre. It could have been an option to just lose more time on the medium and hang it out there for another five six laps and try to do 30 laps on the soft. But also that was not a given  with Daniel Ricciardos charge you could see that it was possible. Given that Hamilton has finished second to Verstappen in the last two races Wolff discussed the progress Mercedes have made over the course of the season and the impact of their latest car upgrades.

Horner: "Hugely worrying" that news of Red Bull's F1 budget cap breach leaked, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/horner-hugely-worrying-that-news-of-red-bulls-f1-budget-cap-breach-leaked/10394371/, It brought an end to the cost cap saga that first emerged over the Singapore Grand Prix weekend in late September when the first whispers emerged that Red Bull had breached the budget cap. Red Bull was only officially informed that it had breached the cost cap on the Sunday of the Japanese Grand Prix 90 minutes after Max Verstappen clinched his second world title. Reflecting on the case in Mexico following the FIAs ruling Horner said he expected followup action to investigate why news of Red Bulls breach had leaked out. The accusations made in Singapore were extremely upsetting for every single member of staff all our partners everyone involved within Red Bull said Horner. Christian Horner Team Principal Red Bull Racing in a press conference regarding the recent findings of the cost cap breach., Listen to this article Red Bull reached a settlement with the FIA over its 1.8 million breach of last years budget cap ahead of the Mexican Grand Prix arguing that it misinterpreted some of the permitted exclusions. The team was hit with a 7m fine and a 10 reduction in its permitted aerodynamic development for the next 12 months a sanction Horner called enormous and draconian. It brought an end to the cost cap saga that first emerged over the Singapore Grand Prix weekend in late September when the first whispers emerged that Red Bull had breached the budget cap. Horner hit back emphatically against the accusations when they were first made as well as calling out rivals for making defamatory claims without any official information from the FIA. Red Bull was only officially informed that it had breached the cost cap on the Sunday of the Japanese Grand Prix 90 minutes after Max Verstappen clinched his second world title. A public notice was then issued one day later. Reflecting on the case in Mexico following the FIAs ruling Horner said he expected followup action to investigate why news of Red Bulls breach had leaked out. The accusations made in Singapore were extremely upsetting for every single member of staff all our partners everyone involved within Red Bull said Horner. Obviously any form of leakage is hugely worrying. Its something that we expect to be followed up. Prior to the Accepted Breach Agreement being struck between Red Bull and the FIA a number of the teams rivals had been clear in the calls for strong action.

The FIA have handed Red Bull a 7m fine and an aero testing reduction Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images McLaren boss Zak Brown wrote to FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem and F1 president Stefano Domenicali to say that any possible breach of the cost cap constitutes cheating something Horner fiercely hit back against in Austin. Horner said after the FIAs ruling that he felt Red Bull was probably due an apology from some of our rivals for some of the claims that theyve made and that the team would make no apology for the way that weve performed the way that weve acted. Horner added We do take on the chin that there are lessons to be made. Potentially mistakes have been made in our submission which with the benefit of hindsight and 2020 vision everybody can be a specialist. But there was no intent there was nothing dishonest and there was certainly no cheating involved which has been alleged in certain quarters. So I dont feel that we need to apologise. I think there are lessons that have been learned. Everybody can learn from this. Weve taken our pounding in public weve taken a very public pounding through the accusations that have been made by other teams. Our drivers have been booed at circuits. And the reputational damage that has been made by allegations has been significant. The time has come for that to stop.

The shutdown is now a core part of F1 and has become more important as the schedule has grown. In 2013 19 races were held but the 2023 F1 calendar features a recordbreaking 24 rounds. This year marks the first time since 2018 that the season has finished before December but racing will start almost two weeks earlier than usual in 2023 as the world championship begins on March 5th. The last time F1 began that early was in 2002 and only starting before March 5th twice in the 19 years before that. I think its great that the season finishes this couple of weeks earlier than in the past because everyone is really on the limiter and I think we plan to introduce a shutdown in the coming year Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff said on Saturday at last weekends Mexican Grand Prix. Advert  Become a RaceFans supporter and go adfree Not everyone is in agreement but I would very much hope that we can do that for our staff. Having this week couple of weeks more is definitely a nice welcome. But on the other side theres many people in the factory who are going to work flatout all through the Christmas and New Year. But for the race team thats clocking many air miles thats positive. Theres many of us team principals that would like to replicate what we have in the summer. At least starting at Christmas and then going into the new year for two weeks. But obviously thats still being up for discussion but there was a positive indication. For the wellbeing of the team. His counterpart at Alpine Otmar Szafnauer expects the plan will go ahead in 2023. This year it isnt happening so itll be next year he said. Christmas its one of those things that always happens on the same day every year. Its not like Thanksgiving. So I think its from the 23rd of December. So I think everyone gets Christmas Eve and Christmas day off. But that week through to the start of the year. Szafnauer also believes the change will be positive for the sport. The way I look at it is were doing more and more races. And if you dont force shutdowns people work through because its a strategic advantage. So if you remove that advantage meaning everyones got to take it off I think its good for all of us. As there is no winter shutdown at present restricting work Szafnauer says Alpines wind tunnel usually only shuts down two days for Christmas and New Years Day. We used to shut it down two days thats it. So if you dont force that shutdown you dont get any time off. Advert  Become a RaceFans supporter and go adfree 2022 F1 season
Gasly's near-ban shows absurdity of F1 penalty points system, https://the-race.com/formula-1/gaslys-near-ban-shows-absurdity-of-f1-penalty-points-system/, The everpresent desire for consistency means that theres a set tariff of penalty points for certain offences. He tipped Vettel into a spin earning a fivesecond penalty as well as two penalty points. This earned him a fivesecond penalty and two penalty points although Gasly questioned why he had been singled out for it. That could potentially create a troubling situation whereby the stewards are reluctant to issue penalty points. But his situation highlights that while the superlience penalty points system needs to exist its current form is flawed and needs reform., Formula 1s superlicence penalty points system is a good idea but poorlyimplemented as the absurd situation Pierre Gasly finds himself in  of being potentially one incident away from an automatic race ban  proves. Gasly has accrued 10 superlicence penalty points just two away from the 12point tally that automatically triggers a race ban. This will be hanging over him for the next nine races given the first of them wont be wiped until after next Mays Emilia Romagna Grand Prix. Whats more he only just evaded a ban for the upcoming Brazilian Grand Prix given the oneyear lifespan for penalty points meant he lost two earned for contact with Fernando Alonso at the first corner of last seasons Turkish Grand Prix shortly before his latest runin with the stewards. The AlphaTauri driver has committed six offences in 15 race weekends stretching back to Mays Spanish Grand Prix so you can argue he only has himself to blame. But while Gasly is overaggressive at times particularly when things arent going well and would be wellserved to rein it in at times hes hardly a danger on track. Adopted in 2014 the superlicence penalty points system was conceived to keep track of repeat offenders and create a mechanism whereby a race ban could be imposed on drivers who showed a troubling pattern of ontrack behaviour. This was a direct consequence of the crash at the start of the 2012 Belgian Grand Prix triggered by Romain Grosjean that took out among others Alonso. It was a logical move given it was felt that the number of incidents Grosjean had been involved with previously contributed to the decision to ban him for the Italian Grand Prix. There was a need for a formalised system that could set the bar for when to ban consistent troublemakers even if they didnt cause as significant an incident as the one Grosjean triggered. The stewards described the Spa crash as an extremely serious breach of the regulations which had the potential to cause injury to others and highlighted that it eliminated leading championship contenders from the race. Setting aside the troubling assertion that whether a driver you eliminate is a title contender or not is a factor in setting punishments something that thankfully has not been cited since in a stewards decision this highlighted the fact that generally a driver would only be banned for a single major incident rather than an accumulation. And that such an accumulation wasnt formally tallied up. There have been cases of bans in the past for such conduct. Famously Mika Hakkinen was banned from the 1994 Hungarian Grand Prix for causing a crash at the start of the preceding race in Germany. Eddie Irvine was given a onerace ban increased to three on appeal for the accident he triggered at Interlagos in 1994 that launched debutant Jos Verstappens Benetton into the air. In both cases there was a feeling that the drivers in question were at times too aggressive and that this contributed to the ban. Gasly driving in reckless manner exposed key F1 blindspot Read more A formalised penalty points system with 12 the threshold for an automatic ban is therefore an effective way to plot the conduct of drivers. Where F1 hasnt got it right is the way that this is implemented. The everpresent desire for consistency means that theres a set tariff of penalty points for certain offences. If you gain an advantage by exceeding track limits or are out of position at the start of the race its one point. For causing a collision or overtaking under the safety car its two points. But theres little or no wriggle room to revise the number of points upwards or downwards to better reflect the offence. Looking at Gaslys rap sheet its clear that while he is a repeat offender the idea that he could be banned for one more mishap in the next races seems ridiculous. Gaslys penalty points Spain  Causing a collision with Lance Stroll at Turn 1 2 points Aston Martin driver Stroll on soft tyres four laps younger than Gaslys mediums attempted to pass the AlphaTauri driver for 14th place on the 27th lap of the Spanish GP. As he had the use of DRS Gasly defended the inside line approaching Turn 1. Stroll was ahead at entry but as Gasly had the inside they were sidebyside at the apex. But as they exited the corner Gasly understeered into Stroll and pitched him into a spin. He was found wholly at fault for the collision although the collision was more due to a lack of grip and also hit with a fivesecond penalty. Austria  Colliding with Sebastian Vettel at Turn 4 2 points This was another case where Gasly was found wholly at fault after failing to give an Aston Martin  this time driven by Vettel  enough room when being passed around the outside. Vettel was just ahead entering the righthander so the move was on but in attempting to contest the corner Gasly braked a little late and understeered as a result. He tipped Vettel into a spin earning a fivesecond penalty as well as two penalty points. Austria  Leaving the track without reason multiple times 1 point Gasly had four laps deleted for exceeding track limits four times. That earned him a fivesecond penalty served at his second pitstop. Two of the offences were at Turn 10 one at Turn 9 and the fourth one at the first corner with stewards finding no justifiable reason for him doing so. Japan  Speeding under red flag conditions 2 points This is the most controversial of the offences and happened after he pitted at the end of lap one for a nose change having collected an advertising board spat onto the track by Carlos Sainzs accident. Gasly was deemed by the postSuzuka report into the controversy about a recovery tractor being on track in poor visibility to have driven in a reckless manner by not respecting yellow flags. Thats despite being well within the safety car delta which hadnt reset after hed visited the pits. But his penalty was for speeding once the red flags were shown about one second before he passed the tractor. He was found to have exceeded 200kmh 124mph on multiple occasionsand reached 251kmh 156mph at one point. US  Falling more than 10 car lengths behind safety car 2 points Gasly was found to have been significantly more than 10 car lengths behind the car in front under the safety car at Austin. This earned him a fivesecond penalty and two penalty points although Gasly questioned why he had been singled out for it. You arrive at 200kmh 124mph hit the brake down to 60kmh 37mph and at the same time the guy in front of you is hitting the throttle flat out and pulls the gap straight away of 150200 metres said Gasly. On the internet a lot of people are quite curious and managed to find a lot of reviews cases of drivers who did the same under the safety car without penalty. Mexico  Leaving the track and gaining an advantage 1 point Gasly passed Stroll for 15th place on the 13th lap of the Mexican GP at Turn 4. He had the inside line into the corner but locked up on the way in and forced Stroll wide. Stroll took to the runoff while Gasly also exceeded track limits. That meant he was given a penalty for leaving the track and gaining an advantage rather than forcing another driver off track. Had he been found to have committed the latter offence which would have been perfectly legitimate he would have gained an extra penalty point. This list of offences highlights several problems. Firstly speeding under the red flag certainly in the way Gasly did it should be worth more penalty points given the safety implications. That is exactly the kind of dangerous driving that the FIA needs to make completely unacceptable. But the rest of the offences are hardly ones indicative of a dangerous driver. Those at Aston Martin might disagree given three of the incidents involve green cars as the victims but they were honest mistakes in battle rather than egregious examples of incompetent or dirty driving. Gasly should take a close look at the way he handles himself in battle to cut back on such incidents and that will benefit both himself and those around him. Whats more he should avoid getting too deep into the mindset that hes being persecuted by the stewards even if his penalty for dropping too far behind the car ahead under the safety car at Austin was incredibly harsh. But he hardly needs the reality check either of a onerace ban or the threat of it. Its not impossible Gasly will get through the next nine events without picking up another two penalty points and that will certainly be his aim. If he does so you could argue the system works as the Sword of Damocles hanging over him might have forced him to modify his ontrack behaviour. But theres a good chance he will commit another offence. That could potentially create a troubling situation whereby the stewards are reluctant to issue penalty points. And as theres little room in the way this is done that might even impact the offences he gets penalised for. That doesnt mean hell not be penalised but it was notable that he was hit with an offence that came with just one penalty point for the Turn 4 incident with Stroll in Mexico rather than being done for forcing him off track which comes with two points. Brown calls for F1 stewards to be fulltime  Why arent they Read more This is connected to the wider question of F1 stewarding. The case for permanent stewards is a strong one and would make it easier for increased flexibility within the penalty points issued to differentiate between what you might call runofthemill incidents and minor errors and those that are more problematic and that collectively indicate a problematic pattern of behaviour. Its all well and good to have guidelines but creating a set menu of points for certain offences has turned what is meant to be a system to tackle those rare cases of those who cannot or will not handle themselves safely on track into an inflexible blunt instrument. If Gaslys rap sheet was more problematic there would be no such concerns. But his situation highlights that while the superlience penalty points system needs to exist its current form is flawed and needs reform.
Formula 1's battle for final 2023 seat: Haas set to choose between Mick Schumacher and Nico Hulkenberg, https://www.skysports.com/f1/news/32133/12736562/formula-1s-battle-for-final-2023-seat-haas-set-to-choose-between-mick-schumacher-and-nico-hulkenberg, Formula 1s battle for final 2023 seat Haas set to choose between Mick Schumacher and Nico HulkenbergMick Schumacher and Nico Hulkenberg are battling it out for a 2023 F1 seat with HaasThe battle for the final Formula 1 seat on the 2023 grid appears to be a straight fight between Mick Schumacher and Nico Hulkenberg with Haas hoping to make a decision before the end of the season. For me its about whats best for the Haas team in the medium to long term. Steiner also reportedly told the German outlet that it was between only Schumacher and Nico Hulkenberg.

All nine other teams  providing Logan Sargeant gets enough super license points to join Williams  have finalised their driver lineups for next year and so all eyes are on Haas with Schumacher no longer the certainty he once seemed to seal another chance alongside Kevin Magnussen. Schumacher the son of F1 legend Michael has been steady but not spectacular since making his muchanticipated debut in F1 in 2021 and has also attracted criticism from his team for his numerous crashes. One of the major pulls for the German meanwhile was that he was a Ferrari junior but the 23yearold is losing his ties to Ferrari Haas engine providers and major partners at the end of this year. Schumacher is still regarded as the favourite for the seat but with Magnussen both outscoring and outqualifying him Haas boss Guenther Steiner recently admitted it was 5050 whether he would remain with the team or not.

Steiner also reportedly told the German outlet that it was between only Schumacher and Nico Hulkenberg. Hulkenberg 35 is a wellknown name in F1 and a wellrespected driver with 181 race starts to his name.

Steiner while looking for the medium to long term has also made it clear he wants his next driver to be a leader. Mick has got some experience obviously its his second year in Formula 1 he said.

Hamilton is out of contract at the end of next season when hell be 38 years old. Another twoyear deal would take him past his 40th birthday. But the seventime champion has showed no signs of slowing down in his 16th season despite the downturn in Mercedess competitiveness thats left him facing the first winless campaign of his career. Watch every practice qualifying and race of the 2022 FIA Formula One World Championship live on Kayo. New to Kayo Start your free trial now  Ahead of anticipated talks over the 202223 offseason Hamilton said he wanted to stay with Mercedes for at least two more years beyond the end of his current deal. Im not putting a limit on it to be honest he said per Autosport. Im planning to do a multiyear deal with my team. I think theres more stuff to achieve together. I just dont know how long. Mercedes boss Toto Wolff said earlier in the season that Hamilton had told him he had another five years in him and speaking at the Mexico City Grand Prix he revealed he expected talks to start after the seasonending race in Abu Dhabi. We havent started any talks he said per Crash. We want to definitely finish the season and then find some quiet time over the winter like we did last time around. Wolff also suggested a new deal would see an expansion of Hamiltons offtrack partnership with the team a key component of his previous deal which has seen team and driver commit to diversity targets within the organisation and Formula 1 more broadly. Hes much more than a driver to us now Wolff said. And although were not talking about a career end its also important to speak about his role as an ambassador for Mercedes and the many sponsors we have and the implication he can have in our wider universe. An extended Lewis Hamilton stay would be a potential spanner in the works for Daniel Ricciardo who is heavily tipped to sign for Mercedes next year as a reserve driver before attempting a fulltime comeback in 2024. Mercedes is the only one of the three frontrunning teams with a seat out of contract in 2024 with both Hamilton and teammate George Russell up for renewal before the end of next season. Candid Ricciardo reveals 2023 plans  0038 Russell is considered the future of the team and a shooin for a renewal after his strong maiden season with the team leaving Hamilton as the only potential avenue into a silver race seat though the Briton has now closed off that route with talk of a new deal. Ricciardo however insists that a decision to sign as a reserve driver wouldnt be dependent on a race seat freeing up in the following season. I dont think its relative to what others do he said. Opportunities will arise when they do. Im not banking on anyone doing something so I can find my way. I want to take the time necessary keep a little bit of distance to the sport and rebuild myself but then if something makes sense in 2024 come back with a vengeance and have some fun and hopefully race at the front. The Australian said he hopes Hamilton resigns so that he might have another chance to race him in a potential career revival. The truth is I want him to stay in the sport he said. Hes one of the greatest ever to do it and I think competing with him going wheel to wheel with him is fun. Its normally at the pointy end so I certainly wish to do that more in the future and thats where it currently lies. World champion Jenson Button has cast doubt on Ricciardos plan for a year out in light of offers from lower order teams to keep in racing in 2023. I really struggle to see him coming back to a competitive team after having a year out he told Sky Sports.

Options narrow for Ricciardo's Formula 1 future, https://www.speedcafe.com/2022/11/03/options-narrow-for-ricciardos-formula-1-future/, There look to be just two potential berths if Daniel Ricciardo is to remain in Formula 1 in 2023. Reserve Drivers perform a variety of functions for teams differing slightly for each but fundamentally offering the same services. Options for Ricciardo as a Reserve Driver are therefore limited. As you know as well we also have an agreement with other teams to share Reserve Drivers. Such a move would also be consistent with Ricciardos own statements where he asserted his future was not contingent on anyone else., There look to be just two potential berths if Daniel Ricciardo is to remain in Formula 1 in 2023. The Australian will not be in a race drive next year but is known to be interested in a Reserve Driver role should a suitable option be available. Following confirmation of Stoffel Vandoorne at Aston Martin earlier this week those potential employers have been further reduced. Reserve Drivers perform a variety of functions for teams differing slightly for each but fundamentally offering the same services. Most visible is their role in the garage listening in to the radio during sessions and taking part in debriefs thereafter. They are at the circuit as a potential shortnotice replacement and are often given time in the car during testing to bring them up to speed with the systems and fundamentals of the machine. This will often see them at events on a Friday before travelling back to base that afternoon ahead of a long night at the factory. There they work in the simulator to refine and develop car setup over a race weekend. The biggest teams will employ multiple simulator drivers with their focus on evaluating different setup options and recommending changes ahead of Saturdays Free Practice 3. Beyond that the Reserve Driver interacts with guests and is an ambassador for the team at public events speaking to the Paddock Club and so on. Typically there are two different types of drivers employed in those roles high potential youngsters who are being groomed for a possible race drive in future or race drivers whose active careers have come to an end. There are exceptions but by and large the bulk of drivers Vandoorne included fall into one of those buckets. Indeed Aston Martin is a perfect microcosm of that the team also employs Formula 2 championelect Felipe Drugovich. Vandoorne had been in a Reserve Driver role at Mercedes since 2020 coupling that with his drive for the threepointed star in Formula E. His exit along with that of Nyck de Vries who will join Scuderia AlphaTauri as race driver for 2023 leaves the AngloGerman operation without a nominated Reserve Driver for 2023. It is one of just three drivers in that position the others being McLaren and Alpine. Options for Ricciardo as a Reserve Driver are therefore limited. Sources have confirmed to Speedcafe.com that he is in discussions with a top team for an opportunity from which we can safely eliminate much of the field. We can further eliminate teams based on their stated positions with McLaren and Alpine having voiced those. Andreas Seidl Team Principal at McLaren has admitted that his team would be open to the concept but no conversations have been had on the notion. Thats a discussion we didnt have yet he said when asked of the possibility by Speedcafe.com. Its a discussion we usually have in winter. As you know as well we also have an agreement with other teams to share Reserve Drivers. Again theres absolutely no hard or bad feelings between Daniel and us and therefore in general I think its possible. At Alpine Otmar Szafnauer all but ruled out the Australians return to Enstone in a Reserve Driver capacity. We havent made that decision yet Szafnauer said of who will step into the role currently officially held by Piastri. But to be fair to Daniel we havent been talking to him about a reserve role. Given that we can logically whittle the list of potential employers to three Mercedes Red Bull and Ferrari. The latter has traditionally favoured its internal programme. It has Robert Shwartzman within its ranks already as well as the experienced Antonio Giovinazzi. In that scenario what does Ricciardo offer that the team does not already have A berth at Ferrari is therefore unlikely. Red Bull on the other hand is a possibility. It has Formula 2 race winner Liam Lawson as its nextinline youngster but when the opportunity presented to move him into a race drive Red Bull instead opted to go outside of its junior programme to recruit Nyck de Vries. Its not a huge vote of confidence in the young New Zealander who has just a handful of test outings in a Formula 1 car to his name. The squad also has Sebastien Buemi though the World Endurance Champions Formula 1 experience is somewhat dated. There is then something of a hole in the squads structure especially when one considers it has four drivers to protect Max Verstappen Sergio Perez Yuki Tsunoda and for 2023 de Vries. It would therefore make sense to bring in an experienced driver at a currently very affordable rate to mitigate that risk while also adding contemporary knowledge to the simulator programme. Of course its need is lower than Mercedes given it at least has Lawson on hand should he be needed. Given Vandoorne and de Vries have both moved on the Brackleybased operation has nobody to back up Lewis Hamilton and George Russell. It has the greatest need of a driver and of those on the market Ricciardo has the best credentials by some considerable distance. Such a move would also be consistent with Ricciardos own statements where he asserted his future was not contingent on anyone else. My future will be lets say I dont think its relative to what others do he said last month when Speedcafe.com asked about his future and Hamiltons intention to carry on beyond 2023. Opportunities will arise when they do but Im not banking on anyone doing something so I can find my way. I want to take the time necessary keep a little bit of distance to the sport and rebuild myself. But then yeah if something makes make sense in 24 come back with a vengeance and have some fun and hopefully race at the front.

As of Wednesday afternoon the lowest price available for a Thursday through Sunday stay was 752 per night at The Linq Hotel  not including taxes and resort fees. Room rates at Caesars Palace were the highest at 1519 per night. Caesars Entertainment Inc. opened its booking portal on Monday for that weekend.

The first tickets for the 2023 Formula One Las Vegas Grand Prix went on sale Tuesday with ticket packages ranging between 500 and 10000 before taxes and fees. Room prices are dynamic and are likely to change depending on demand. But resort operators are bullish that theyll be able to fetch a high price for the week which is usually considered a soft week for visitation to the city. We think Formula One is a different animal Caesars CEO Tom Reeg said Tuesday during an investors call. The demand for that particular event is well beyond what we were expecting. As you saw the rates roll out Monday the pricing reflects that. Amanda Belarmino assistant professor at UNLVs William F. Harrah College of Hospitality said a common pricing practice is to start high and see whether demand is strong enough to sell at that price point. Its better to not leave money on the table Belarmino said. You can always discount if needed but first you can see what the market will hold. High prices on the Strip during special events are not unusual. Resorts are also likely researching pricing in other markets that have hosted onetime major events such as the Olympics Super Bowl and other Formula One races she said. Plus hotels often block off rooms for loyalty members  like MGMs promotion  which further drives up the value of any remaining available rooms. Given Formula Ones large fanbase abroad Belarmino expects there will be many international travelers who are less price sensitive because of the events uniqueness. The pricing also suggests that resorts are expecting consumers who typically dont come to Las Vegas. The prices do signal If youre not here for F1 then come some other time she said. The whole city will be geared around this event regardless of the price. If you want to see what it has to offer on a regular basis come another time when its going to be geared more towards you.

Jenson Button warns Daniel Ricciardo he could be ruining his Formula One career with huge mistake, https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-11383315/Jenson-Button-warns-Daniel-Ricciardo-ruining-Formula-One-career-huge-mistake.html, Former F1 world champion Jenson Button has warned Daniel Ricciardo his plan to become a reserve driver in 2023 instead of taking a seat with a backfield team could do irreparable damage to his career. Ricciardo has been linked to a reserve position with Mercedes and Red Bull next season  a move Button believes would make it extremely difficult for him to return to drive for a top team again. But I still think it would have been a better move for him  go into a team work hard show people what you can do in a car that maybe suits you a bit more and then people forget what happened the year before. Its a tricky one and I really struggle to see him coming back to a competitive team after having a year out. And with the calendar being so long it was hard to remove yourself from what was happening in the racing., Former F1 world champion Jenson Button has warned Daniel Ricciardo his plan to become a reserve driver in 2023 instead of taking a seat with a backfield team could do irreparable damage to his career. The Australian has been dropped by McLaren after failing to find form with the famous English outfit and recently exclusively revealed to Daily Mail that he wants a little distance from the sport so he can rebuild himself after two years of shocking results. Ricciardo has been linked to a reserve position with Mercedes and Red Bull next season  a move Button believes would make it extremely difficult for him to return to drive for a top team again. The struggling Aussie star has confessed he wants to put some space between himself and the sport next year as hes been connected to a reserve role with Mercedes or Red Bull Exworld champ Jenson Button pictured with wife Brittny believes stepping back from the starting grid will make it very hard for Ricciardo to return to driving for a top team I guess he didnt want to drop too far down the grid and work with a team thats more towards the rear because its difficult for a driver coming from a team that is almost wining races at times to suddenly know youre fighting for points Button said on Sky Sports. It is tough. But I still think it would have been a better move for him  go into a team work hard show people what you can do in a car that maybe suits you a bit more and then people forget what happened the year before. But sitting out People just remember what happened last year. Its a tricky one and I really struggle to see him coming back to a competitive team after having a year out. Ricciardos desire to put some distance between himself and the sport stems from how badly hes been affected by his struggles this season and last. Despite a thrilling run to seventh in the Mexico Grand Prix that earned him Driver of the Day honours Ricciardo sits a lowly 12th in this years drivers standings with just 29 points to his name  far behind teammate Lando Norris whos coming seventh with 109. Ricciardo pictured at the Mexico Grand Prix had to speak to a psychologist last year as his shocking run of form at McLaren took its toll My confidence was being eaten away driving a car that wouldnt dance with me and would bite back Ricciardo told Daily Mail. Whenever we thought we would found a solution along would come another set of challenges. When you put so much into something and it doesnt work out there is sadness. It gets to you. Last year it affected me a little bit too much. I wouldnt be my usual bubbly self. I would be reluctant if someone said lets go out for dinner. I would need some cajoling. I let it get to me. I started to speak to a psychologist last year  the most challenging year I have had. Racing is very much results driven and dictates your Sunday happiness. I was neglecting friendships and thought it would be good to talk to someone to make sure the two sides of my life didnt cross over. Its like all things you need perspective. And with the calendar being so long it was hard to remove yourself from what was happening in the racing.
Mika Hakkinen agrees with Toto Wolff on Red Bull's F1 cost cap punishment, https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/hakkinen-wolff-red-bull-punishment-28394694, Mercedes team principal Wolff gave a specific reason why his team will not risk breaking cost cap rules in the future and F1 champion Hakkinen believes the Austrian made a good pointDouble Formula 1 world champion Mika Hakkinen does not believe any team will be willing to break cost cap rules after Red Bull were slapped with a significant punishment. Red Bull overspent during the 2021 season and agreed not to fight the penalty imposed by the FIA. That point of view has been backed up by Hakkinen who feels the cost cap rules still have teeth. The first thing to say is that I am glad this matter is now closed and the FIAs penalty accepted by Red Bull the Finn wrote in his Unibet column. Red Bulls penalty for the minor overspend is still significant., Mercedes team principal Wolff gave a specific reason why his team will not risk breaking cost cap rules in the future and F1 champion Hakkinen believes the Austrian made a good point Double Formula 1 world champion Mika Hakkinen does not believe any team will be willing to break cost cap rules after Red Bull were slapped with a significant punishment. Red Bull overspent during the 2021 season and agreed not to fight the penalty imposed by the FIA. The team was fined 6m and will lose 10 of their aerodynamic testing time over the next 12 months as punishment for breaching budget cap regulations. The punishment divided opinion among others as some felt justice had been served and other worried that it might not be enough to prevent others from willingly breaking the rules in the future now a precedent has been set. Asked for his opinion by Mirror Sport team boss Christian Horner said it is a strong deterrent adding  Anyone who diminishes that penalty doesnt know what theyre talking about. Reacting to the punishment Mercedes chief Toto Wolff explained that the threat of reputational damage would be enough to deter his team from willingly overspending. Whatever team you are youre responsible for representing a brand your employees and your partners and thats why for us it wouldnt be something they would do said the Austrian. That point of view has been backed up by Hakkinen who feels the cost cap rules still have teeth. The first thing to say is that I am glad this matter is now closed and the FIAs penalty accepted by Red Bull the Finn wrote in his Unibet column. With technical and sporting regulations you generally have a clear decision for example if the car is under the weight limit or a driver goes outside the track limits but with the financial regulations there was always likely to be a grey area. Image Formula 1 via Getty Images Formula 1 via Getty Images I think that is why everyone accepted two levels to breaking the budget cap  a minor or major overspend. The FIA recognised that there could be various levels of overspend and reasons for doing so. Red Bulls penalty for the minor overspend is still significant. Far more than the financial or aerodynamic penalty it has been an uncomfortable experience for the team. The good thing is that no team will want to risk repeating this next year so although it has been a very difficult and controversial moment for Red Bull I believe it will benefit F1 in the long term because every team boss will be determined not to have this kind of negative publicity in future. Speaking about the criticism he and his team faced in the wake of the cost cap breach Horner explained We have taken a public pounding from the accusations that other teams have made. Weve had our drivers booed at circuits. The reputational damage has been significant and the time for that to stop is now and move on.

Piero Ferrari Binotto lead tributes to legendary F1 engineer Forghieri, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/piero-ferrari-f1-binotto-tributes-forghieri/10394301/, On the teams website Piero Ferrari recalled mediating between his father and Forghieri. While Mauro Forghieri taken on a few years earlier was next door. We mourn the passing of Mauro Forghieri one of the most amazing people to have worked here. Current head of GT sporting activities Antonello Coletta said Mauro Forghieri played a key role in fuelling the history of Ferrari. Enzo Ferrari claimed to be an agitator of men and I think we can say that Forghieri was an agitator of ideas., Listen to this article Forghieri is widely regarded as one of the key players in the history of Scuderia Ferrari having been a team manager and both a chassis and engine designer with the Maranello outfit. His stint with the company lasted from 1959 to 1987 encompassing some of its most memorable successes. He is credited with an involvement in 54 race wins and 11 world championships. On the teams website Piero Ferrari recalled mediating between his father and Forghieri. When I joined the company in 1965 I shared an office with Cavalier Giberti Ferraris first employee he said. While Mauro Forghieri taken on a few years earlier was next door. We were therefore separated by 10 years of age and a window. In fact we saw each other all day every day. Forghieri was energetic and passionate about everything he did. He was sanguine and I recall that in many of those interminable meetings at the Gestione Sportiva that started in the evening and went on into the night I mediated between him and my father. I know my father appreciated his tireless work ethic and he knew that any mistakes only came about through an attempt to do something better and to look ahead. We have lost a part of our history a man who gave a great deal to Ferrari and to the world of racing in general. Chris Amon Ferrari 312 Mauro Forghieri chief engineer Ferrari founder and owner Enzo Ferrari Photo by Motorsport Images Binotto noted that Forghieri was a great motivator with a charismatic personality. Today is a very sad day for everyone at Scuderia Ferrari he said. We mourn the passing of Mauro Forghieri one of the most amazing people to have worked here. He was appointed as team manager at the age of 27 and with his brilliant insights he was one of the last allround engineers in the car world. I met him on various occasions and each time was something special. He was to the end a truly charismatic individual. His revolutionary ideas together with his vibrant nature his abilities as a great motivator meant he played a very important role in some of the most significant moments of Ferraris history and he did more than most to fuel the Prancing Horse legend. We will all miss him. Forghieri was also very much involved in Ferraris sportscar racing programme which was shelved in the early 1970s. Current head of GT sporting activities Antonello Coletta said Mauro Forghieri played a key role in fuelling the history of Ferrari. Enzo Ferrari claimed to be an agitator of men and I think we can say that Forghieri was an agitator of ideas. He was a brilliant innovator capable of coming up with technical solutions that eluded most of the engineers of his day. He was a designer who went beyond his defined role who became a benchmark and a source of inspiration for everyone who worked with him. He was an eclectic designer and his curiosity and desire to push the boundaries sealed his place in the history of Ferrari and motorsport in general.
OBITUARY: Mauro Forghieri technical genius behind some of Formula 1’s greatest Ferraris remembered, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.obituary-mauro-forghieri-technical-genius-behind-some-of-formula-1s-greatest.67IR5vwYq73vG9mhaKYd3N.html, Mauro Forghieri who has died at 87 found himself thrust into the F1 limelight in 1962 at the tender age of 26. He later worked directly for Alfa and Mauro went to school in Milan. He himself had gatecrashed some Ferrari lunches where driver Clemente Biondetti a fourtime Mille Miglia winner had become his hero. His was thus an allround education in the racing world learning at the feet of the spirited technical director Carlo Chiti. There was excitement when Ayrton Senna tested the engine for McLaren and was impressed with it as a potential replacement for the Honda V12 engine they were due to lose for 1993., Mauro Forghieri who has died at 87 found himself thrust into the F1 limelight in 1962 at the tender age of 26. His grandfather Anselmo was a passionate and committed socialist who was a friend of Mussolini and Sandro Pertini the socialist politician who went on to become the president of Italy from 1978 to 1985. His father Reclus trained at the Fermo Corni Technical Industrial Institute and worked with Enzo Ferrari in 1937 and 38 in Milan during the conception of the Alfa Romeo 158 which went on to claim the first two official Drivers World Championships in 1950 and 51. He later worked directly for Alfa and Mauro went to school in Milan. Separated by the war the Forghieri family was reunited when hostilities ceased and after working for a while on classic cars while living between Nice and Monaco on the French Riviera Reclus returned to Modena and went to work as a toolmaker at Ferrari where he remained until 1973. READ MORE Under the bodywork of the Ferrari 312B3 Mauro who shared his grandfathers and fathers penchant for passionate selfexpression was raised there then educated at Bologna University where he graduated in 1959 with a doctorate in mechanical engineering. He revealed that his father had been only slightly interested in racing as the Mille Miglia had actually passed by their front door. He himself had gatecrashed some Ferrari lunches where driver Clemente Biondetti a fourtime Mille Miglia winner had become his hero. He had done an internship at Ferrari in 1957 but his knowledge of Formula 1 was minimal and after an initial leaning towards teaching he then considered emigrating to California to work for a company making aircraft turbine engines. But Enzo Ferrari himself was insistent that he should follow his father into the company. Soon he became involved in myriad engineering projects learning not just about engines but gearboxes chassis and suspension. His was thus an allround education in the racing world learning at the feet of the spirited technical director Carlo Chiti. Forghieri back to camera stayed with Ferrari after an exodus of personnel including Carlo Chiti L  who designed the Sharknose cars The big break came on October 30 1961. At that time Ferrari had won the World Championship with Phil Hill and the Sharknose 156. In a reverse palace coup Chiti and team manager Romolo Tavoni and most of the design staff had quit. Tired of Laura Ferrari Enzos wifes endless meddling they had formed Automobili Turismo e Sport ATS in Sasso Marconi in Bologna with financial backing from industrialists Jaime Ortiz Patino Giorgio Billi and Count Giovanni Volpi. Hill went with them and when the venture failed his career was left in ruins. It was a Monday Forghieri recalled. My life was turned around completely. Ferrari called me and got straight to the point. He said From this moment on you are responsible for all the motor sport activity and testing. I was amazed agog but I was able to maintain a certain lucidity he admitted. But as he pointed out immediately to Il Commendatore he was only 26 and had zero experience. READ MORE Legendary Ferrari engineer Mauro Forghieri passes away aged 87 Moreover while Ferrari had gained the jump on the dominant British teams Lotus Cooper and BRM when they refused initially to accept that the new 1.5litre formula really would happen in 1961 by 1962 with new V8 engines and in Lotuss case the groundbreaking bathtub monocoque chassis they had caught up and exposed Ferraris inherent weaknesses. His was thus a Herculean task but by 1963 he had persuaded Ferrari to employ John Surtees whose talent together with Chris Amons in later years he believed to be the equal of Jim Clarks. By 1964 Surtees had taken Ferrari to the Drivers and Constructors World Championships and though the subsequent series of 312 cars were necessarily born around an elderly 3litre V12 sportcar engine from 1966 and only won three races between that year and 1969 the flat12 engine he commissioned Franco Rocchi Franco to create for 1970 led to a rebirth when installed in his own 312B chassis. Forghieri with the Daytonawinning 330 P4 one of the revered P series of Scuderia sports cars Jacky Ickx narrowly lost out on the title that year but by 1974 Ferrari was back on track with Niki Lauda and Clay Regazzoni winning races. Lauda went on to win Drivers titles in 1975 and 77 after missing out narrowly to James Hunt in 1976 and Ferrari won the Constructors titles in all three years. He designed the transversal transmission that helped to create the cars excellent weight distribution from 1975 onwards. Jody Scheckter aided by Gilles Villeneuve added two more titles in 1979 and the turbocharged 126 cars of 1982 and 83 likewise won Constructors laurels as British designer Harvey Postlethwaite was engaged to work alongside Forghieri. Polemics were always a crucial part of Ferrari given the passionate support of the tifosi and the aggression of an Italian media that was intolerant of anything other than success. Ferrari scored but a single victory in 1984 and by 1985 the politics within the team obliged Ferrari to move Mauro sideways as face was saved by appointing him director of Ferraris advanced research office and Harvey was left in sole charge of F1 engineering. Mauro endured this new regime working from January 1985 on the 408 4RM concept car until it was completed in May 1987 whereupon he finally left the Scuderia to take on the role of technical director of the newly formed Lamborghini Engineering. Lamborghini had been bought by Chryslers Lee Iacocca that year and he wanted an F1 engine to help sell its roadgoing supercars. Company boss Daniele Audetto had worked with Forghieri while he was team manager at Ferrari and they worked well together as Mauro designed a normallyaspirated V12 engine for the new 3.5litre formula which came into force for 1989. It would power a Lola entered by Gerard Larrousses team. The engine was shown to the media in April 1988 and ran for the first time at Dijon in December in a Larrousse Lola driven by Philippe Alliot. It showed potential though the best result was just a sixth for Alliot in the Spanish GP. The engine was used by Larrousse and Lola for 1990 the best results being a thirdplaced podium for Aguri Suzuki for the former in Japan plus sixths in Britain and Spain and fifth in Hungary and sixth in Canada for Derek Warwick for the latter. Forghieri who designed the innovative 312 T series with Lauda L Agreement was reached for Lamborghini Engineering to design a bespoke car powered by the V12 engine for Mexican businessman Fernando Gonzalez Lunas new team for 1991. Forghieri oversaw the project as Mario Tolentino drew the Glas 001 but when Luna disappeared in June 1990 and the nascent team succumbed Audetto convinced Italian financier Carlo Patrucco to take over the project and Mauro was appointed technical director of the new Modena Teams Lambo 291. The arrangement proved shortlived and he was back at Lamborghini Engineering developing the V12 further until he was replaced by Mike Rice after a shakeup. There was excitement when Ayrton Senna tested the engine for McLaren and was impressed with it as a potential replacement for the Honda V12 engine they were due to lose for 1993. In the end however that deal came to nothing. Mauro designed an electric minivan for Enel in 1992 and was appointed technical director of Bugatti Automobili where he developed the EB110 and 112 models before leaving to found Oral Engineering in Modena with Franco Antoniazzi and Sergio Lugli early in 1995. His work there embraced the design research and development of automobile motorcycle marine and gokart engines for clients such as BMW Bugatti and Aprilia and turning the Ferrari Pinin concept car into a pukka roadworthy vehicle. Later he was chief engineer in the mid2000s on the Project 1221 MF1 sports car. He was also one of the technical experts called to court during the official investigation into the death of Ayrton Senna at Imola on May 1 that year. Forghieri oversaw the creation of the Bugatti EB110

Speaking to selected media including Motorsport.com Hamilton said We are going to do another deal. Were going to sit down and were going to discuss it in these next couple of months I would say. Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff says his squad is not looking for anyone else as the seat was 100 percent Hamiltons. However he felt that there was no rush to get things settled immediately  and that it would be easier to sort things out including wider responsibilities beyond driving once the season was finished. We havent started having talks explained Wolff. We want to definitely finish the season and then find some quiet time over the winter like we have done last time around that literally started in the winter holidays and lasted over two months. We havent done that. But hes much more than a driver to us now. Although were not talking about a career end its also important to speak about his role as an ambassador for Mercedes and the many sponsors that we have and the implication he can have in our wider audience.

They stuck with me through everything that was going on through 2020. Theyve stuck with me through my mistakes and shit thats been in the press theyve stuck with me through the ups and downs.

And I want to be the best teammate I can be to them because I think we can make the brand even better more accessible even stronger than it is. And I think I can be an integral part of that.
Doohan ‘more than ready’ for F1 chance after Mexico cameo, https://www.foxsports.com.au/motorsport/formula-one/doohan-more-than-ready-for-f1-chance-after-mexico-cameo/news-story/be3148ddd135ac0410fcef33c0460826, Aussie rising star Jack Doohan has his sights firmly set on Formula 1 after getting his first taste of a grand prix weekend in Mexico City. Doohan took part in first practice at the Mexico City Grand Prix as the most senior member of Alpines junior driver academy standing in for Esteban Ocon. Another practice session is also on his horizon at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix as part of the teams efforts to better embed him into its grand prix operation and Doohan said it was part of the plan to ready him for his eventual F1 debut.

Doohan took part in first practice at the Mexico City Grand Prix as the most senior member of Alpines junior driver academy standing in for Esteban Ocon. It was the culmination of his junior program with the team that has so far featured three private tests in last years car as well as 100 kilometres in the current Alpine for a filming day. Watch every practice qualifying and race of the 2022 FIA Formula One World Championship live on Kayo. New to Kayo Start your free trial now  The 19yearold has impressed in his standout rookie Formula 2 campaign this season sitting fourth in the championship with three wins including in the feature race at SpaFrancorchamps. He could finish in the top three depending on results at the final round of the year. He was briefly considered for a sudden elevation to Formula 1 for next season when both Fernando Alonso and Oscar Piastri defected from the team during the midseason break but Alpine instead signed Pierre Gasly giving Doohan a second campaign in Formula 2 to hone his craft. Another practice session is also on his horizon at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix as part of the teams efforts to better embed him into its grand prix operation and Doohan said it was part of the plan to ready him for his eventual F1 debut. Im just trying to prepare myself as much as possible and kind of maximise what I can do  learn as much from the team and try and really embed myself with the team so if the opportunity does arise to get in the car or become a fulltime driver Im more than ready he told select media including Fox Sports. Thats what Alpine are helping me to do and really thats the plan. Im part of their future which Im a very thankful for. This is the plan to obviously win Formula 2 next year as well as be in the best possible position to see what the future holds. NASCAR driver uses wall to advantage  0126 Its a role similar to that held by Piastri before he split with the team. That process remains ongoing with McLaren so far signalling that it doesnt expect to get access to the Australian until next year. But despite Piastri being shuffled towards the exit Doohan said he hadnt yet been given his compatriots reservedriver status for this season or next. I havent had any clarification on that he said. An Alpine spokesperson added that an announcement on reserve drivers would be made in due course. Regardless of the formalities theres no doubt Doohans path to Formula 1 has opened dramatically in the last 12 months. His decision at the end of last year to switch to the Alpine program from Red Bulls junior academy  which is much celebrated but held at arms length from Red Bull Racing  has paid dividends in terms of his connectedness to a Formula 1 team and the active development hes receiving. Its also put him in a prime position to capitalise from the turmoil in Alpines driver roster elevating him to the top of the junior program just as the best of his Formula 2 results started to flow. Verstappen claims another win Ric 7th  0235 Asked whether he could see his route into Formula 1 Doohan said he was confident. For sure I see that he said. The possibility is there. I just need to obviously keep on working doing the best that I possibly can and keep working with Alpine because theyve been honestly amazing to me. Im really proud to be part of the team and I hope to be a part of their future and in the long plan because from just working with the team in the past two events and my short periods while in F2 we have amazing potential here. Good things are 100 per cent coming so to be part of it in the future should be really cool. Theyve helped me so much from joining the academy in January to doing my first FP1 session now in October so theyre looking after me really well. I cant wait to repay the favour hopefully in years to come.

Ive watched the event on TV for many years and I came so close to competing last year until I had to pull out at the last minute. It was tough watching everyone having so much fun throwing their cars around on the snow and ice in Sweden so Im glad I will now be joining them at Pite Havsbad in January. The Finnish driver was set to make his debut in the 2022 iteration of the Race Of Champions but pulled out days before the competition. This season he has again planned to compete alongside compatriot and twotime F1 champion Mika Hakkinen in the ROC Nations Cup on January 28 and the individual Race Of Champions on January 29. Im also thrilled to be able to partner Mika Hakkinen for Team Finland in the ROC Nations Cup. I have become good friends with Mika over the years but it will be a special treat to be able to race alongside him. Weve both taken part in the Arctic Rally a few times so hopefully that can help us beat our Nordic neighbours  and everyone else. Then well have to put our friendship aside again and try to beat each other in the individual Race Of Champions. Whatever happens Im sure we will put on a great show for all the fans watching at the track and around the world.

As for the secret to success I might tell Valtteri before the ROC Nations Cup but only if he promises to have forgotten it by the individual race the next day
Will Red Bull's punishment deter future F1 cost cap breaches?, https://www.crash.net/f1/feature/1016171/1/will-red-bull-s-punishment-deter-future-f1-cost-cap-breaches, Red Bull have been fined 7m and docked 10 percent of their aerodynamic testing time for the next 12 months after their submitted accounts were found to be 1.6 percent over the 145m spending limit set during Max Verstappens titlewinning 2021 campaign. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner described a 10 percent aero research reduction for an 0.37 overspend as draconian but said his team begrudgingly accepted the sanction for the good of the sport. Asked whether the punishment was strong enough to prevent Mercedes from purposely committing a breach in future Toto Wolff argued the reputational damage Red Bull sustained was a big enough deterrent. Mike Krack whose Aston Martin team were fined 450000 after striking their own ABA for procedural infringements of the cost cap insists the FIA must be trusted to govern fairly and properly. This is for the FIA to judge Krack said when asked if he thinks the penalty strengthens the budget cap., Red Bull have been fined 7m and docked 10 percent of their aerodynamic testing time for the next 12 months after their submitted accounts were found to be 1.6 percent over the 145m spending limit set during Max Verstappens titlewinning 2021 campaign. The FIA ruled there were 13 areas where Red Bull had wrongly excluded costs which amounted to an overspend of 1.8m however F1s governing body acknowledged the team would have exceeded the cap by only 432652 had they not omitted a tax credit in their submission. Is Hamilton No Longer the Best Wet Weather Driver Video of Is Hamilton No Longer the Best Wet Weather Driver Red Bull team principal Christian Horner described a 10 percent aero research reduction for an 0.37 overspend as draconian but said his team begrudgingly accepted the sanction for the good of the sport. With rivals including Ferrari and McLaren publicly expressing their displeasure at the size of the penalty questions were raised as to whether the FIAs verdict would draw a line under the case or open up a new can of worms. Asked whether the punishment was strong enough to prevent Mercedes from purposely committing a breach in future Toto Wolff argued the reputational damage Red Bull sustained was a big enough deterrent. I think what you see is that beyond the sporting penalty and the financial fine theres also a reputational damage and in a world of transparency and good governance thats just not on anymore Wolff told Sky Sports. And compliancewise in whatever team you are youre responsible for representing a brand your employees your partners and thats why for us it wouldnt be a business case. For Ferrari question marks still remain. Ferrari racing director Laurent Mekies was sceptical about Horners claims and the overall impact of the penalty suggesting Red Bulls Accepted Breach Agreement with the FIA simply encourages money that could have been detracted from their budget to be spent elsewhere. We at Ferrari do not understand how the 10 reduction of the ATA can correspond to the same amount of lap time Mekies told Sky Sports Italia. Furthermore there is another problem in that since there is no budget cap reduction in the penalty the basic effect is to push the competitor to spend the money elsewhere. It has total freedom to use the money it can no longer spend on use of the wind tunnel and CFD due to the 10 reduction on reducing the weight of the car or who knows what else. Our concern is that the combination of these two factors means the real effect of the penalty is very limited. Time to close the chapter Other teams believe it is the end of the matter  for now at least. Mike Krack whose Aston Martin team were fined 450000 after striking their own ABA for procedural infringements of the cost cap insists the FIA must be trusted to govern fairly and properly. This is for the FIA to judge Krack said when asked if he thinks the penalty strengthens the budget cap. I think there has been enough polemics around the whole topic about how big the fine has to be. I think we should now look to the front and not back and discuss who had which fine and if it was large enough or not. The FIA is in charge of doing that. We have to trust that they do that correctly and respect that. Despite dismissing Red Bulls claim that their penalty could cost them up to half a second in laptime next season Alfa Romeo team principal Fred Vasseur echoed Wolffs view that brand damage alone would stop teams from making the same mistake. The biggest punishment for a team is to accept that they were overspending in terms of image and we dont have to underestimate this one  for your employees for your sponsors and so on Vasseur explained. I think its very good to reach the end of the discussion to have a clear picture of the FIA to have a clear decision from the FIA to have an agreement from the team also this will help to close the chapter. Then if you speak about technical or sporting decisions or penalties its a bit different for me because Im not sure we are making half a second with 10 per cent of your allocation or we are very stupid. Horner highlighted the matter could have dragged on for months had Red Bull challenged the FIA and decided to take things as far as the FIAs International Court of Appeal. Concerns have also been raised about how long the auditing process took as well as the prospect for F1 to be facing a case of deja vu when the results of teams spending for 2022 are revealed. To avoid another potential cost cap saga this time next year teams have urged F1 and the FIA to find a way of speeding up the process to ensure there is no controversy hanging over the outcome of the previous seasons championship. I think we should close this chapter now for 2021 but the FIA has to control the teams from the very beginning onwards from January onwards which is what I said already two years ago when we discussed this cost cap story said AlphaTauri team principal Franz Tost. Why Because the regulation is very very complicated and there is room for different interpretations and therefore the teams need some support and the FIA has to send people to the teams to check all this because its bad for the image of Formula 1 for the teams whatever if one year afterwards we discuss about overspending or whatever. This has to be done and sorted out during the season that at the end of the season everything is finalised and the technical regulations are also possible why shouldnt it be possible in the financial regulations. We have a meeting every Tuesday. I know every Tuesday how much we are below the cost cap and how we have to react and I think this should be the F1 standard that at the end of the season we know who won the championship and that this team was below the cost cap and everything has been sorted out.
PALMER: Could Mercedes have beaten Verstappen in Mexico City with bolder calls from the pit wall?, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.palmer-could-mercedes-have-beaten-a-flawless-verstappen-in-mexico-city.12yaYeWa0ZnfzQjzYLfZy6.html, Barely anybody has been able to beat Max and Red Bull on merit this season and it was the case again in Mexico on Sunday. Mercedes arrived in Mexico in buoyant mood. But Mexico City is a circuit where the polesitter has had an erratic time in the past so the thought of a Mercedes victory  or at least an entertaining fight for the win  seemed plausible on Saturday evening. It certainly would have made it a closer fight though had Hamilton been able to clear Perez quickly  no guarantee given Red Bulls topend speed advantage. Switching him to softs would likely have given Mercedes a double podium and by staying out there was the added benefit of pitting during a potential Safety Car., Max Verstappen has been nothing short of sensational this season and deservedly notched up his 14th win of the season ensuring his domination of 2022 will go down in the history books. Nobody has scored more wins in a single campaign in Formula 1. His dominance is underlined by the fact that there are still two races remaining to bolster that stat. Barely anybody has been able to beat Max and Red Bull on merit this season and it was the case again in Mexico on Sunday. But could Mercedes have won it Mercedes arrived in Mexico in buoyant mood. The thin air caused by the extreme altitude of Mexico City meant that their drag deficit which has been hampering their straightline speed this year was reduced. POWER RANKINGS Who tops the charts after the Mexico City Grand Prix Mercedes enjoyed the highaltitude Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez Verstappen produced a sublime lap in qualifying to clinch pole position doing what neither Mercedes driver could manage  putting three best sectors together on a single lap. Hamilton was compromised by abusing track limits on his first Q3 effort which naturally meant he had to be slightly more cautious on his second as he had no banker lap. Russell meanwhile was neckandneck with Verstappen heading into the final sector before sliding off wide at Turn 12 and aborting the lap. But Mexico City is a circuit where the polesitter has had an erratic time in the past so the thought of a Mercedes victory  or at least an entertaining fight for the win  seemed plausible on Saturday evening. No polesitter at the previous three Mexican Grands Prix had even managed to make the podium. READ MORE In hindsight its always easier  Wolff defends Mercedes Mexico strategy as wait for 2022 win goes on Inevitably that changed with the dominant Dutchman on pole commanding a lightstoflag victory as weve come to expect this year. What we didnt expect was Mercedes challenge wilting after they were talking up their chances prerace and have been so close to victory at other circuits where their pace seemed less competitive. This came down predominantly to their strategy and more specifically their use of the hard tyre in the Grand Prix. Jolyon Palmers Analysis Who made the right choices in Mexico City The hard tyre wasnt a good tyre as evidenced by Daniel Ricciardo who used the soft to charge his way past the midfielders who had opted for it earlier on. Ricciardo was even fast enough to overcome the deserved 10second penalty that he received for taking Tsunoda off at Turn 6 in his botched attempt. Given Ricciardo made effectively 20 seconds on Lando Norris  on the soft tyre versus the hard tyre in the second stint  its plausible that a similar choice for Mercedes could have given Hamilton a chance of fighting Verstappen given his 15second deficit in the end. The decision for Hamilton was a tough call for Mercedes who would have lost track position to Perez had they waited for the soft tyre rather than boxing for hards earlier on. It was an understandable choice and in all likelihood wouldnt have changed the outcome for their seventime champion. READ MORE The design secrets that set Red Bulls RB18 apart from its F1 rivals Hamilton unlike Norris was lapping in clear air and thus the comparison to Ricciardos pace is probably too generous. It certainly would have made it a closer fight though had Hamilton been able to clear Perez quickly  no guarantee given Red Bulls topend speed advantage. The call for Russell was the bigger error from Mercedes in my opinion. Russell matched the pace of Hamilton throughout the Mexican weekend and had nothing to lose by doing something different as he was already fourth in a fourcar race. Switching him to softs would likely have given Mercedes a double podium and by staying out there was the added benefit of pitting during a potential Safety Car. Mercedes could have had a double podium with a mediumsoft strategy George was calling for it from the cockpit as well but Mercedes were ultimately cautious with strategy in Mexico  and thats not how they will be able to challenge the mighty VerstappenRed Bull partnership in 2022. Credit should go to Verstappen for the way he absorbed the early pressure and then optimised his own strategy by ensuring he had plenty of life in the medium tyre. Mexico has always been a low energy track thats kind on tyres. Red Bull used that to their full advantage but it still takes the driver to do the job from the cockpit as well. Verstappen is looking the complete package right now and while his victory stats show the extent of his dominance this season they dont display the full array of his skillset that weve witnessed.

F1 set to abandon plan to lower tyre blanket temperatures for 2023, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/f1-set-to-abandon-plan-to-lower-tyre-blanket-temperatures-for-2023/10393961/, Listen to this articleThe move has long been planned as part of an additional change for 2024 where tyre blanket use is set to be totally abandoned within the championships sustainability drive. Because this is the period of blanket that is using a lot more energy  its like the oven at home he continued. And to propose a full 2023 strategy of tyre blanket heating two hours at 70C. Thats the plan for the moment.It is understood that Pirelli has also presented its 2023 tyre blanket idea to the FIA and the F1 organisation and has received positive feedback to the new approach rather than lowering the blanket temperature to 50C. Isola also suggested that the inevent tyre testing conducted in Austin and Mexico could return at certain events next year., Listen to this article The move has long been planned as part of an additional change for 2024 where tyre blanket use is set to be totally abandoned within the championships sustainability drive. But lowering tyre blanket temperature alone has proved to be unpopular with the drivers and has been in the headlines in particular since the recent US Grand Prix where the first of two inevent 2023 tyre tests took place before the second occurred in Mexico last weekend. Red Bulls world champion Max Verstappen said the move would lead to a lot of crashes while McLarens Lando Norris felt everyones going to shunt their car at some point. In response to the drivers comments after the Austin test Pirelli conducted an experiment for the Mexico test where the tyres were heated in blankets at 70C but only for two hours and not the usual three which would have remained the operation for the 50C limit being brought in. Pirelli apparently discovered that this change actually used less energy overall and would soothe the drivers concerns at the same time. Pirelli motorsport boss Mario Isola then explained to Motorsport.com that while for 2024 the plan is still not to have a blanket for next year the investigation of our analysis said that if you warm the tyres at 70C for two hours and not three hours you save more energy than the blankets at 50C for three hours. Because this is the period of blanket that is using a lot more energy  its like the oven at home he continued. So if you switch it on you have a first phase where you go up to the required temperature and then its stabilised. But to keep the temperature at the level you want you need to use energy. So thats the point. Tyre heating system Ferrari F175 Charles Leclerc Carlos Sainz Photo by Erik Junius Isola presented Pirellis findings to the drivers in their Mexico City GP postFP2 regular briefing. He said that the drivers agreed they would prefer F1 to adopt the approach of heating the tyres hotter for a shorter period. For me its a sensible solution said Isola. As I said we also save more energy. Now we have to analyse all the data from the heating approach ahead of the Mexico test because clearly the test was only last Friday and we didnt have a lot of time to analyse the data. The rest of the plan is to find the five compounds we want to homologate for 2023. Then bring the final version of the tyres to Abu Dhabi for the postseason test so the drivers can test the final range of compounds. And to propose a full 2023 strategy of tyre blanket heating two hours at 70C. Thats the plan for the moment. It is understood that Pirelli has also presented its 2023 tyre blanket idea to the FIA and the F1 organisation and has received positive feedback to the new approach rather than lowering the blanket temperature to 50C. Isola also suggested that the inevent tyre testing conducted in Austin and Mexico could return at certain events next year. These are useful only for Pirelli getting data on how the compounds it is producing are working rather than building the specific construction of the tyres  that requires longer private test events as cars need their setups adjusted to get the right data. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes W13 Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images What they call in competition test is an option for the future said Isola. Especially next year we have 24 races we have a second part of the season with a lot of overseas events. We know how much teams and team personnel are stressed because they have to travel a lot and so on. So if we have this option we dont oblige the teams to stay out for another 23 days for our tyre testing. And we can use this in a second part of the season. As the 2024 tyre blanket ban plan is remaining at this stage it would be logical to expect that either Pirelli would have to produce all new tyre constructions for that year or the teams would have to make substantial changes to their designs to improve earlystint tyre warm up. There were suggestions from some engineers that on this factor too the impact of the proposed reduction to 50C tyre blanket heating had only been fully revealed very late in the car design process for 2023 which also added to the opposition to that plan being utilised.
Alpine: Alonso F1 engine failures are "luck of the draw", https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/alpine-alonso-f1-engine-failures-are-luck-of-the-draw/10394180/, After the race Alonso reflected on how many engine problems he has had in 2022 and how they always seemed to happen to his car. So again this was an engine issue said Szafnauer when asked why there was a pattern. And we dont have the same people preparing an Esteban engine or a Fernando engine they all mix around. Esteban in the latter half of the race started losing water pressure so we had to lift and coast it he explained. But we dont know the root cause., Listen to this article The Spaniard was forced to retire from last weekends race on the 64th lap with a cylinder issue while running in seventh place. The retirement cost Alpine priceless points in its battle with McLaren for fourth in the F1 world championship. After the race Alonso reflected on how many engine problems he has had in 2022 and how they always seemed to happen to his car. So again this was an engine issue said Szafnauer when asked why there was a pattern. And we dont have the same people preparing an Esteban engine or a Fernando engine they all mix around. The probability of this happening isnt zero. So it can happen. But it is lower to always to have it on one side or the other. But when I was at Honda I cant remember how many engine failures Takuma Sato had like 13 in a year and Jenson Button had none. Zero. And the question always came up we couldnt find anything to show that it was one side or the other. And at that point the questions were always does Takuma drive it so much differently to Jenson that it always happens on his side I think it was just the luck of the draw. So I think its the luck of the draw this time. Pressed on whether or not there was a reason he said Not that we can find. So its not that we can see that Its this set of circumstances its always on Fernandos side. An exasperated Fernando Alonso Alpine F1 Team after retiring from the race Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images Szafnauer admitted that he understood that Alonso might be upset Look we apologise to Fernando. You always feel frustrated when youre managing a race forward backward. I mean there was no risk whatsoever. And you know the points are in the bag no ones pushing you. And that makes it even more frustrating. So I get it. The race initially went to plan for Alpine with Alonso and teammate Esteban Ocon crucially ahead of the McLarens of Lando Norris and Daniel Ricciardo. Alonso also gained a place from Valtteri Bottas with Ocon jumping the Finn later on. Once we were ahead of them it was just about managing said Szafnauer. Fernando for example was driving at about a second a lap slower than he could have. And just managing temperatures brakes. We knew it was going to be tough to get it to the end. And Esteban on the other hand did a really good job to get ahead of the McLarens. We initially set out to go on to the hard. But then we did see that the soft was possible too we watched some others. We didnt react too quickly. And Lewiss lap time was really good on the hard. So we kept with our strategy which would have worked well to the end. But Fernando had his cylinder issue which meant he had to stop. We tried to get him to limp home but eventually he couldnt. He had that issue for about 13 to 14 laps before we stopped him. The good news for Alonso is that he should have enough power unit elements in his pool to make it through the last two races without penalty This engine was never going to run again anyway. However the root cause we dont know yet. It could have been a sparkplug could have been a piston ring could have been excessive knock. Szafnauer also revealed Ocon didnt have a straightforward race to his eighth place either. Esteban in the latter half of the race started losing water pressure so we had to lift and coast it he explained. We dont know what it is yet. But it looked like it was a small water leak in the water system somewhere which is why you start losing pressure. And the best way is to stabilise it. If you can imagine if youre boiling water the pressure will raise in whatever vessel its in and you bring it down you cool it down less pressure less leak. So it didnt cause any damage. But we dont know the root cause.
Mercedes junior gets first F1 test - but is he another Russell?, https://the-race.com/formula-1/mercedes-junior-gets-first-f1-test-but-is-he-another-russell/, Mercedes junior Frederik Vesti will pilot one of the teams Formula 1 cars in the postseason Abu Dhabi Grand Prix test but can he follow in the footsteps of George Russell and progress to F1 Danish driver Vesti will get his first taste of F1 machinery in the Yas Marina test at which current Mercedes reserve Nyck de Vries is set to make an early debut for his 2023 employer AlphaTauri. Theres little immediate competition within the top ranks of the Mercedes junior programme  although 16yearold Andrea Kimi Antonelli might just be the next big thing  so Vesti was the obvious choice for the young driver test with De Vries leaving for AlphaTauri. Its still a small vindication for the hard work hes put in behind the scenes on Mercedes simulator this year. Clearly Mercedes has little room within its own F1 team with Russell thriving since he joined at the start of the year and Hamilton likely to extend his current deal beyond 2023., Mercedes junior Frederik Vesti will pilot one of the teams Formula 1 cars in the postseason Abu Dhabi Grand Prix test but can he follow in the footsteps of George Russell and progress to F1 Danish driver Vesti will get his first taste of F1 machinery in the Yas Marina test at which current Mercedes reserve Nyck de Vries is set to make an early debut for his 2023 employer AlphaTauri. De Vries was on AlphaTauris radar earlier than you might think Read more Vesti joined the Mercedes junior programme off the back of his rookie FIA Formula 3 campaign in 2020 where overall he fell short of his more experienced Prema teammates Oscar Piastri and Logan Sargeant who are both headed for F1 in 2023 with McLaren and Williams respectively although Sargeants deal is yet to be confirmed and he requires super licence points. Although he couldnt join them in the title fight and was generally thirdbest among them he did match and outshine them on occasion. He remained in F3 for 2021 and switched to another junior singleseater behemoth ART Grand Prix but a title challenge failed to materialise and he finished fourth for the second consecutive season with a single victory. Vesti then stepped up to Formula 2 with ART racing alongside Sauber protege Theo Pourchaire who along with Piastri and Sargeant had beaten Vesti in F3 in 2020. Pourchaire leads that intrateam fight as he runs second in the drivers championship heading into the Abu Dhabi finale while Vesti is eighth but only nine points adrift from fourth place. Following a tricky start where he was pointless in the opening five races Vesti looked seriously quick in the middle of the season. He picked up his maiden F2 win in Baku qualified on the front row at Silverstone and then was on pole at the Red Bull Ring. That Austrian GP feature race was a disaster as a tardy start was followed by penalties for leaving the track and gaining an advantage and track limits violations that left Vesti emptyhanded from a weekend where he looked so strong. More pointless weekends would come later in the year at Spa and Zandvoort but this was followed by an excellent brace of second place finishes at Monza such has been the rollercoaster nature of Vestis season. Consistency over a season has been lacking for Vesti since he won the Formula Regional European Championship in 2019 in a field that rarely exceeded 11 cars. Its hardly been as convincing a rise up F1s ladder as the likes of Russell who won GP3 now F3 and F2 in backtoback years but not every future F1 driver has to boast that kind of record. This years F2 season has been one of the most bizarre inconsistent and hard to read in the championships history. Vesti has by no means stood head and shoulders among that field this year but equally hes not been far off star rookie Sargeant and Jack Doohan both of whom were right among F1s 2023 silly season. Vesti will likely reunite with Prema  responsible for four of the last seven F2GP2 champions  for a second year of F2 in 2023 so he should have the right tools to deliver a potential title challenge. Theres little immediate competition within the top ranks of the Mercedes junior programme  although 16yearold Andrea Kimi Antonelli might just be the next big thing  so Vesti was the obvious choice for the young driver test with De Vries leaving for AlphaTauri. Its still a small vindication for the hard work hes put in behind the scenes on Mercedes simulator this year. Clearly Mercedes has little room within its own F1 team with Russell thriving since he joined at the start of the year and Hamilton likely to extend his current deal beyond 2023. But Vesti can still put himself in the conversation for a 2024 F1 seat somewhere on the grid if he can excel in F2 next year against some stiff competition including likely returnees Doohan Pourchaire and Dennis Hauger as well as his probable new Prema teammate highlyrated Ferrari junior Ollie Bearman. Comparisons to Russell are optimistic at this stage of Vestis career hes shown flashes of real speed but hes yet to string it together in a convincing enough fashion to demand promotion to F1 in the same way Russells results and work with Mercedes did throughout 2017 and 2018. Its down to Vesti to change that in Abu Dhabi and in 2023.
Formula 1's Las Vegas Grand Prix Is Going to Cost More Than Monaco, https://jalopnik.com/formula-1s-las-vegas-grand-prix-is-going-to-cost-more-t-1849730690, Formula 1s upcoming 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix is one of the more hyped events to join the series calendar and now it looks like prices are going to reflect that hype. That officially makes this race more expensive than the Monaco Grand Prix  and thats also not taking into account the massive number of lush packages that are said to be available to VIPs. If you want a little perspective grandstand tickets for a full weekend at the 2023 Monaco Grand Prix will run at maximum 410.59 using prices from Goo Tickets. The most expensive threeday grandstand ticket available via Grand Prix Tickets is just about 1500. It seems like the Las Vegas Grand Prix is catering to a bigticket buyer and the rest of us will be left in the dust., Formula 1s upcoming 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix is one of the more hyped events to join the series calendar and now it looks like prices are going to reflect that hype. According to presale information via the tracks website youre going to be paying 500 for General Admission alone  or 2000 if you want a guaranteed seat. That officially makes this race more expensive than the Monaco Grand Prix  and thats also not taking into account the massive number of lush packages that are said to be available to VIPs. If you want a little perspective grandstand tickets for a full weekend at the 2023 Monaco Grand Prix will run at maximum 410.59 using prices from Goo Tickets. The most expensive threeday grandstand ticket available via Grand Prix Tickets is just about 1500. Im going to be honest If I paid 500 to literally stand around in one small flat area of Las Vegas in the hopes of seeing a race car on a street circuit and could get my hands on no beverage more powerful than a 0 Heineken Id snap. That right there would be my Joaquin Phoenix Joker moment. Advertisement If you were looking for a grandstand ticket you can expect to pay somewhere between 2000 and 2500  though it currently isnt clear if those are static ticket prices or if those are just the starting price for certain grandstands. For example at Circuit of the Americas certain rows of a grandstand may cost more than a different row of the same grandstand due to the view. Youll have to inquire about hospitality as well but Skybox shared hospitality is priced at 10000 for four days. I also want to note that these are presale prices listed via Ticketmaster knowing how Ticketmaster sales usually go theres a good chance scalpers are going to make a pretty penny on resales for the folks who didnt nab tickets right away. GO Media may get a commission 400 off Anker 767 PowerHouse Powered by GaNPrime Anker is launching a new power station in its lineupthe Anker 767 PowerHouse. It delivers a massive amount of power at 2400W and has a suitcase design for easy portability. Buy for 400 off at Anker Advertisement The thing that I find most fascinating is that these tickets are grouped together by small region and you only have access to that region. If you have tickets for hospitality in the South Koval Zone for example you cant go pop over to General Admission and see how things are going. You cant meet up with a friend behind the West Harmon Zone grandstands. I understand that temporary street circuits are inherently limited but Ive never seen such a cordoning off of track regions. Of course my experience largely comes from IndyCar where street circuits like Long Beach Detroit Toronto and St. Pete generally confine viewers to certain areas  but you can still wander around all those areas. In Miami for Formula 1 it was the same story there were a lot of places you couldnt go but any area open to one fan was open to all fans. Ive been looking forward to covering the event as media but it also makes me wonder how much Id actually get to see in order to report on the track ambiance. Advertisement Its going to be interesting to see how the limited fan experience plays out  though Im not sure many of the folks buying tickets are going to be the Average Joe who adores F1. It seems like the Las Vegas Grand Prix is catering to a bigticket buyer and the rest of us will be left in the dust.

Ferrari’s rivals don’t think Mexico slump was true reflection of F1 form, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/ferrari-rivals-mexico-slump-form/10393998/, That left the door open for Mercedes to emerge as Red Bulls main challenger for the victory. However few believe that the Mexico showing was realistic of where Ferrari stacks up right now.

I think Ferrari looked like they were a little bit handicapped this weekend so Im not sure we saw their real pace. Im pretty sure if Im listening at the drivers later on in the debriefing they will tell me that the car was not turning., Listen to this article Ferrari endured one of its most challenging outings of the season in Mexico last weekend as it could not extract its regular pace from the F175. That left the door open for Mercedes to emerge as Red Bulls main challenger for the victory. In the end Carlos Sainz was the lead Ferrari to come home in fifth place but he finished more than 58 seconds behind race winner Max Verstappen. With Mercedes having enjoyed an uplift in form over recent races Ferraris performances have prompted suggestions that Red Bulls main threat is now the German car manufacturer rather than the Italian squad. However few believe that the Mexico showing was realistic of where Ferrari stacks up right now. Asked if Red Bull regarded Mercedes as its strongest competitor in F1 team boss Christian Horner said I think this track has played to their strengths. I think Ferrari looked like they were a little bit handicapped this weekend so Im not sure we saw their real pace. Im sure theyll be back. Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff reckons that while things have gone better for his squad in recent outings a much better picture would emerge from the Brazilian GP. Pushed on if he felt Mercedes was ahead of Ferrari Wolff said I wouldnt want to say that because they are a strong team and weve had a few strong Sundays now. But maybe this circuit flattered us. I think after Brazil well have maybe more of a picture but I dont think theyre suddenly half a minute slower than us. George Russell Mercedes W13 Carlos Sainz Ferrari F175 Charles Leclerc Ferrari F175 Photo by Sam Bloxham  Motorsport Images Ferrari is hopeful that the scale of its deficit in Mexico was a oneoff caused by altitude which meant its power unit could not perform as well as it does nearer sealevel. However team principal Mattia Binotto said that a lack of power did not offer a full explanation for why it was so far adrift of Red Bull and Mercedes. I think the compromise both of them drivers are mentioning certainly is in terms of power unit we were not at our best performance for the weekend he said. But I dont think that thats explaining the most. Thats part of the equation but there is certainly more than that and its something which we need to look at. There is not a clear answer right now. The ride was not great. The balance was not great. Im pretty sure if Im listening at the drivers later on in the debriefing they will tell me that the car was not turning. The reason why I think it has to be looked at and we have not a clear explanation right now. Additional reporting by Filip Cleeren
Mauro Forghieri obituary: Legendary Ferrari F1 designer dies at 87, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/legendary-ferrari-f1-designer-mauro-forghieri-dies-at-87/10394065/, Enzo Ferrari and Mauro Forghieri Photo by David PhippsDuring his tenure he was instrumental in creating some of the squads most successful and famous F1 designs. Other drivers he helped win the championships with at Ferrari included Niki Lauda and Jody Scheckter. When that project was completed he left Ferrari for good in 1987. Following his long career at Ferrari Forghieri moved to Lamborghini where he worked on its V12 engine that raced in F1 in 1989 and 1990. Otherwise in my eyes he is not a world champion.As the result of his historical contribution to Ferrari Forghieri received honorary citizenship of Modena last January., During a lengthy career as the technical chief at Ferrari from 1962 to 1984 he helped guide Ferrari to four drivers titles seven constructors crowns and 54 grand prix victories. He originally joined Ferrari as an apprentice in 1960 having graduated from the University of Bologna with a mechanical engineering degree. Having made a good early impression following the departure of then chief designer Carlo Chiti in 1961 he was asked by team founder Enzo Ferrari to step up to head the technical side of the team. Enzo Ferrari and Mauro Forghieri Photo by David Phipps During his tenure he was instrumental in creating some of the squads most successful and famous F1 designs. This included the V8powered 158 that John Surtees won the world title with in 1964 as well as the 312 series of both grand prix and sportscar fame. Other drivers he helped win the championships with at Ferrari included Niki Lauda and Jody Scheckter. Forghieri finally left his position as technical director in 1984 and switched to a new role working on the Ferrari 408 4RM concept car. When that project was completed he left Ferrari for good in 1987. Following his long career at Ferrari Forghieri moved to Lamborghini where he worked on its V12 engine that raced in F1 in 1989 and 1990. He was also briefly involved in the ultimately stalled efforts for a new Lamborghinibacked GLAS F1 team which then became the Modena squad in 1991. When Lamborghinis engineering department was reorganised at the end of 1991 and the Modena team ran out of funding Forghieri left and helped set up the mechanical design Oral Engineering Group whose clients included BMW Bugatti and Aprilia. He was still involved with the project until recently. Mauro Forghieri consults Niki Lauda Photo by David Phipps The Italian kept a close eye on F1 and several years ago famously made it clear how he did not like the current rules that allowed for DRS. I dislike the whole aerodynamics of the current cars he said. I dont understand why it is not reduced in order to allow normal overtaking without DRS. Now if ones opponent is less than a second behind he can only watch as his pursuer goes past  and that cannot be correct. A world champion needs to be in a position to overtake his opponent without help. Otherwise in my eyes he is not a world champion.

The underrated Verstappen trait behind his new F1 record, https://the-race.com/formula-1/the-underrated-verstappen-trait-behind-his-new-f1-record/, And it is no coincidence that the same drivers tend to excel in this area  with Verstappen certainly among them. Verstappens tyre management has won him races before this. His first victory in Spain in 2016 on his Red Bull debut is a favoured example. While the softmedium strategy didnt seem to be seriously on many peoples radar Red Bull was confident it was possible because it had two drivers capable of making it work. Even when Verstappen looked occasionally vulnerable to Hamiltons chasing Mercedes he always managed to keep it at arms length., Max Verstappens recordbreaking 14th victory in the 2022 Formula 1 season came down to something that he talked about after his ninth. Its not only today I think Im always good on tyres Verstappen said at the Belgian Grand Prix when asked about how well he had managed his Pirellis in an extended opening stint on softs. Maybe people dont look at it. Just as that win at Spa required a gentle touch to manage the softs and make a onestop strategy work effectively so too did his Mexican Grand Prix win last weekend. The implication with Verstappens answer at Spa obviously was that when the likes of Sergio Perez and Lewis Hamilton get hailed as tyre whisperers Verstappens own skill in this regard is underrated. He was right though. Verstappens headline qualities are his speed and his aggression. But he is a much more refined driver than that. Tyre management is one of F1s unsexy skills and can sometimes be dismissed as a particularly negative aspect of modern F1  as if it was never a factor in years gone by. It is a crucial skill. And it is no coincidence that the same drivers tend to excel in this area  with Verstappen certainly among them. Verstappens tyre management has won him races before this. His first victory in Spain in 2016 on his Red Bull debut is a favoured example. In Austria in 2018 he drove cleverly by lifting slightly through the highspeed corners to put a little less energy into them and avoid the blistering issues that struck thenteammate Ricciardo and Hamilton. That year he also obliterated Ricciardo in Mexico where he has now won four times pulling a full pitstop on him despite managing his laptimes and his tyres after grabbing the lead at the start. This year has provided different case studies. If there is a specific modern F1 demand it is that the working range of the Pirellis requires the tyre to be brought in carefully or they will not last as long as they should. Those who truly get on top of this have a wonderful sensitivity. They feel the tyre underneath them and usually know how hard they can push without taking it too far. At the same time if they do wander into some tyre strife they can get it back under control. For instance this helped Verstappen win the United States Grand Prix where after losing time in his pitstop he had to work the tyres harder than hed have liked running in the dirty air of the Ferrari of Charles Leclerc and then passing it. By his own admission I damaged my tyres a little bit too much in the beginning of that new tyre set and that meant Verstappen had to be restrained in his chase of Hamilton to recover the tyres. Which he did and then he pushed and then caught Hamilton and then he passed him to win. Verstappen has more patience in certain scenarios than he is given credit for aided by the growing confidence hes had that the car will have enough pace once the tyres are where they need to be. This was the case in Mexico a race that demands a lot of discipline. While the softmedium strategy didnt seem to be seriously on many peoples radar Red Bull was confident it was possible because it had two drivers capable of making it work. Even when Verstappen looked occasionally vulnerable to Hamiltons chasing Mercedes he always managed to keep it at arms length. I never really felt like I was under pressure I was just managing my tyres to get through that number of laps he said. The key Mercedes mistakes that surprised Red Bull in Mexico Read more Once Verstappen got a good idea of what the softs could handle he pushed to build his lead to over two seconds and that gave him a buffer as the tyres started to fall away right at the end of the stint. But he had done enough to make the long run on mediums realistic. It was still a question mark Verstappen said but within a few laps he had the feeling he needed to get to the end. Which he did. It was an achievement against Mercedes initial expectations but in keeping with Verstappens proficiency at not abusing the tyre and therefore another example of what Red Bull team boss Christian Horner believes Verstappen has been masterful at this year. When you see how hes playing with the tools that he has available to him within the car hes constantly on top of them said Horner. You hear the banter between him and his engineer and hes got a tremendous feel for what the tyres need and what they dont need and its something hes developed. Hes always been strong at it but I think this year hes been exceptional.

The 2022 Championship has not been the season Ricciardo had hoped for with the Aussie struggling to break into the top ten.

Thats where I dont know I dont know how Im continuing to continue because to say its painful is an understatement. He vowed to spring back and spring back he did putting in his best drive of the championship in Mexico where he came from 12.5s behind Esteban Ocon to overtake several cars before taking P7 off him. He then put 12 seconds between himself and the Alpine driver to negate the 10second time penalty hed received for hitting Yuki Tsunoda. He was voted Driver of the Day a muchwelcomed plaudit for the beleaguered driver. Im happy for him that after these tough years hes had a little sense of achievement again F1Insider quotes the former F1 driver Hulkenberg as having told ServusTV. This Nothing just Danny Ric doing a finger gun before an overtake MexicoGP F1pic.twitter.comJXWlJoSYnh  PlanetF1 PlanetF1 October 31 2022 McLaren team boss Andreas Seidl also applauded Ricciardos performance in Mexico acknowledging it would be a welcome boost for the driver. Daniel then really flew and showed great overtaking manoeuvres he said. Im even happier for him because he can now go into these last two races with selfconfidence. With his McLaren career over Ricciardo is now looking ahead to a year on the sidelines with the 33yearold taking the time to recharge before potentially returning in 2024. Turning down the chance of a Haas seat he said Its now just trying to set myself up for success Id call it in the long term. Hulkenberg reckons its a welcome break for the eighttime grand prix winner. I think after the two turbulent years hes glad that hes going to be out for a year and can sort himself out he said. Knowing him and seeing his body language I think he needs to get off this Formula 1 rat race. But while Ricciardo is leaving the rat race there are suggestions Hulkenberg will be back in it next season. The German is being tipped to replace Mick Schumacher at Haas next season after Aston Martin announced Stoffel Vandoorne as their reserve driver.

More info Formula One CEO Stefano Domenicali may end up angering Christian Horner and Toto Wolff after he travelled to Colombia to discuss adding a race there to the sports schedule. The two great rivals have both previously spoken out about the length of the F1 calendar and may worry about the impact of another South American race on their Red Bull and Mercedes colleagues. In 2023 Formula One will have more races than ever before with 24 events scheduled to be on the calendar. However it looks like it could grow even further with Domenicali entering negotiations with Colombia about a future Grand Prix while a return to South Africa has also been widely mooted. Under the terms of the Concorde Agreement signed in 2020 no more than 25 races can take place within a season meaning current events would have to drop off if Colombia and South Africa were to join with Belgium among the most likely. Yet this may not be enough to pacify Wolff and Horner after the team bosses were unhappy with the expanded calendar for next year. The Austrian argued the change was unsustainable and he claimed that he would no longer travel to all races as a result.

Ferrari's Shwartzman 'very sad' at fading Formula 1 dream, https://www.motorsportweek.com/2022/11/02/ferraris-shwartzman-very-sad-at-fading-formula-1-dream/, Ferrari test driver Robert Shwartzman has conceded that his Formula 1 race ambitions are likely over after missing out on a seat for another season. What will happen in the future I dont know yet but its super hard and challenging to get into Formula 1. I dont really understand it the lineup and the driver decisions teams do I dont get it from my side. If you dont race you miss that spirit of being a race driver to fight to win and push yourself. Imagine if I dont race I will wait wait wait and if I have the opportunity I would not be ready for it as I had not raced since 2021., Ferrari test driver Robert Shwartzman has conceded that his Formula 1 race ambitions are likely over after missing out on a seat for another season. Shwartzman was among Ferraris leading junior prospects claiming the 2019 FIA Formula 3 title and finished fourth in his rookie Formula 2 campaign before placing runnerup to teammate Oscar Piastri in 2021. Of the 2020 crop champion Mick Schumacher Yuki Tsunoda and Nikita Mazepin stepped up to Formula 1 while from the 2021 group Zhou Guanyu debuted this year and champion Piastri will belatedly graduate with McLaren in 2023. Shwartzman instead took up a role with Ferrari as its official test driver and was tasked with undertaking extensive simulator duties. He was nominated as its young driver participating in FP1 in Austin and will partake in the corresponding session in Abu Dhabi. Offtrack Shwartzman also switched his racing license to Israel the country of his birth and has spent much of the year in Italy to where he moved as a child. Honestly it was a tough year Shwartzman tells MotorsportWeek.com. Unfortunately I didnt race which for any racing driver is a big thing. What will happen in the future I dont know yet but its super hard and challenging to get into Formula 1. I always pushed and worked really hard it didnt matter what was going around with the dream or target to get to Formula 1. Will it happen or not happen At this stage I dont know. I can guess maybe not. And thats obviously very sad for me because it has been such a big work and I kept on pushing and believing and at the end still it doesnt happen for various reasons. Shwartzman accepts that the thing I could have done a bit better is bring the results those years in 2020 and 2021 and that would probably give me a bigger help to get into F1 but stresses theres still no guarantee Id be there. There is also an aspect of disillusionment with the structure of the driver market. I mean F1 is a bit weird to be honest these days for me at least he says. I dont really understand it the lineup and the driver decisions teams do I dont get it from my side. I dont want to put names but for me unfortunately it doesnt always go by the merit. Oscar had to wait a year and it was a bit messy for him. I put myself in it as well I pushed him hard did hard work and I know if I would have a chance Id show Im capable. It is what it is at this stage its the situation where I cant do anything about it even though Id love to and make it more fair. Robert Shwartzman RUS  ISR Ferrari Developement Driver. United States Grand Prix Friday 21st October 2022. Circuit of the Americas Austin Texas USA. When pressed on why he feels that way Shwartzman replies Well I cant go up to a team and say take me because I really deserve it and would bring the results I cant do that because I can say it prove it and show it on eventual results but the decisionmaking thing is not going to be on me. So looking at how it is now its maybe not the main priority for them. The status of 2019 F2 champion Nyck de Vries is raised with the Dutchman sealing a 2023 AlphaTauri seat hugely facilitated by his substitute appearance with Williams at Monza. But Shwartzman isnt keen on such a strategy and wants to get back behind the wheel somewhere in 2023. Honestly for Nyck it happened after three years he raced and honestly I respect Nyck and think hes talented and good but the stars aligned perfectly for him and he did a good job of taking that opportunity  he got one shot and he took it Shwartzman explains. Will I Who knows. To wait and sit here and waste time not racing just hoping for a miracle to happen I would not really see it quite logical for me and anyway after doing this work I really want to race next year as I miss racing. If you dont race you miss that spirit of being a race driver to fight to win and push yourself. Imagine if I dont race I will wait wait wait and if I have the opportunity I would not be ready for it as I had not raced since 2021. So for me the main priority next year is to go race. Where I dont know we are looking at options and what we have on the table for the best offer possible and well see. Shwartzman is nonetheless hopeful that the recent setbacks will stand him in stronger stead for 2023 and beyond. Theres positives to take as I matured more I learned more I know how to handle myself better with the engineers how to work with them better so anyway for my career  it doesnt matter where I will be  it was an important phase in my life he reflects. We did a few tests with the old car I did the FP1 first time in Austin the first time in the car so it was very interesting and very cool. Well have another one in Abu Dhabi thats it not much driving unfortunately but it is what it is.
Tickets to the F1 Las Vegas GP Go on Sale Starting at $500, https://www.thedrive.com/news/tickets-to-the-las-vegas-gp-go-on-sale-starting-at-500, Tickets have gone on sale for the firstever Las Vegas Grand Prix and as with everything in Formula 1 theyre rather expensive. Liberty Media is investing big in the Las Vegas Grand Prix as part of its broader push into the US market. The Las Vegas race will be the penultimate championship round in 2023 taking place on November 18 just prior to the season finale at Abu Dhabi. Pedants will note that while this the first inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix its not the first Grand Prix to take place in Las Vegas. Steep ticket prices arent particularly surprising then let alone in Las Vegas., Tickets have gone on sale for the firstever Las Vegas Grand Prix and as with everything in Formula 1 theyre rather expensive. The official ticketing website began presales to American Express Early Access customers on Tuesday. In the Phase 1 offering a basic general admission ticket will set you back 500 for a threeday pass. This is for the standingroom only section at the MSG Sphere and includes a food and nonalcoholic drinks package. Its unclear whether these are the promised affordable tickets that would be made available but The Drive has requested clarification and will update this article accordingly. Those wanting a seat in the MSG Sphere grandstand section will have to cough up 2000 for the privilege. The MSG Sphere zone covers from Turn 5 through to Turn 9 including the lowspeed switchback of Turn 7 and Turn 8. The coveted startfinish straight is covered by the East Harmon zone. A seat in the grandstand there comes at a higher cost of 2500. Beyond that are the Skybox tickets for those with the deepest pockets. Unlike the lower tier tickets these cover four days of action across the weekend. They also cost 10000 apiece. At this stage tickets are still in the presale phase. Sales will open to those who registered for the Priority Interest List on November 3 before going on sale to the general public on November 5. All tickets will be sold as minimum threeday passes so dont expect to save money by only showing up for the race. There is also a limit of eight tickets per customer via the official ticketing outlet. Liberty Media is investing big in the Las Vegas Grand Prix as part of its broader push into the US market. The 2023 calendar will feature three races stateside with the new event joining the existing Miami and Austin races on the calendar. The Las Vegas race will be the penultimate championship round in 2023 taking place on November 18 just prior to the season finale at Abu Dhabi. Pedants will note that while this the first inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix its not the first Grand Prix to take place in Las Vegas. That honor goes to the oftridiculed Caesars Palace Grand Prix run in 1981 and 1982. Taking place on a track literally built in a casino car park the circuit was unpopular with drivers and attracted few fans. Originally a Formula 1 World Championship event it was retooled into a CART race for 1983 and 1984 before being abandoned altogether. Formula 1 has never been a budget sport for the fans or the drivers. Steep ticket prices arent particularly surprising then let alone in Las Vegas. Still if youre looking to get involved 500 for a threeday pass isnt too bad especially given the food and drinks are on the house.

Norris started the race in eighth but lost out to both Alpines of Fernando Alonso and Esteban Ocon on the first lap dropping down to 10th. He maintained that position before switching from the mediums to the hard tyre as he attempted to avoid the undercut from AlphaTauris Yuki Tsunoda  who changed from the softs to the mediums. Norris was then able to make his way past Valtteri Bottas for tenth towards the end of the race. Alonsos retirement saw him gain a place to ninth after he also let team mate Daniel Ricciardo  on the soft tyre  through to finish seventh ahead of Ocon.

That opened up the chance for Daniel to go very long and on to the softs which gave him the opportunity to finish seventh and score some valuable points for us. I think we did a good job did what we had to do at certain points but we still looked at the big picture and the other side did a very good job today. Im happy.

Norris: Mexico F1 strategy "a mistake" relative to McLaren teammate Ricciardo, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/norris-mexico-strategy-mistake-ricciardo/10393568/, In contrast Norris who stopped earlier joined several others in going from the medium to the hard only to find it was lacking performance. He finished ninth some 16.5 seconds behind Ricciardo on the road having been three places ahead of him early on. Just one off the line and then one around the first few corners which is just a bit unlucky sometimes. He added We covered Yuki Tsunoda very early on which meant I had to go onto the hard tyre. I wouldnt say Brazil is going to suit us at all with our balance of the car and so on and our struggles., Listen to this article Ricciardo went from medium to soft tyres and had sufficient pace to not only charge up to seventh place but also negate a 10second penalty for contact with Yuki Tsunoda. In contrast Norris who stopped earlier joined several others in going from the medium to the hard only to find it was lacking performance. He finished ninth some 16.5 seconds behind Ricciardo on the road having been three places ahead of him early on. The Englishmans race had already been compromised by a difficult first lap in which he was passed by Fernando Alonso and Esteban Ocon of Alpine the team that McLaren is battling for fourth position in the world championship. I lost just two places in the beginning obviously both to Alpines which is the main thing he explained when asked by Motorsport.com about his start. Just one off the line and then one around the first few corners which is just a bit unlucky sometimes. So nothing too bad just the way it is. The rest I think we did a reasonable job. Norris made it clear that he did not get to run the strategy that he had hoped to use estimating that Ricciardos strategy was worth over 30 seconds over his own. He added We covered Yuki Tsunoda very early on which meant I had to go onto the hard tyre. So I would not really what I wanted to do. So maybe a bit of a mistake there to do that. But Daniel did what I wanted to do which was to stay out and then go onto the soft which was like 3040 seconds quicker in terms of race time. I think we did the best we could. Still managed to get past Bottas bought us with a few laps to go. So that one extra point always helps. Regarding the general lack of grip he said I mean thats just what we have to deal with. Yeah we made a mistake going onto the hard tyre. You dont have to use it we chose to. Thats life. Esteban Ocon Alpine A522 Lando Norris McLaren MCL36 Yuki Tsunoda AlphaTauri AT03 Photo by Sam Bloxham  Motorsport Images Norris is unsure about the teams potential form in Brazil as the battle with Alpine over fourth in the constructors title continues. The Enstone outfit currently leads by just seven points with two races remaining on the calendar and Norris was not especially buoyant about McLarens chances in Brazil. It makes me happy that were closing the gap he said. But were working hard. So I feel like we deserve to be getting what were getting at the end of the day. But it means we still have to work extremely hard to beat them over the next two races. I dont know how were going to do to be honest with you. I wouldnt say Brazil is going to suit us at all with our balance of the car and so on and our struggles. But I think even the last few races weve not been the quickest car or quick enough weve just done a better job with the strategy and with reliability such as today. So lets get to the chequered flag.

Delusional Horner is tarnishing the whole sport of Formula One, https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/delusional-horner-is-tarnishing-the-whole-sport-of-formula-one-d59jpvs3n, Lewis Hamilton was robbed. Even the FIA the governing body admits that it was a significant error from the race director. So permit me to say it again Hamilton was robbed. If the rules had been correctly applied he would now have an eighth world title. Horner may now be pondering whether, Lewis Hamilton was robbed. I think we should make that plain at the start of this column. I emphasise this because Christian Horner and Max Verstappen of Red Bull decided to boycott Sky Sports after one of its reporters used this word in relation to the finale of the 2021 season after a controversial safety car restart in the last moments of the race. Even the FIA the governing body admits that it was a significant error from the race director. So permit me to say it again Hamilton was robbed. If the rules had been correctly applied he would now have an eighth world title. If the race director had done his job Mercedes would boast another champion. Horner may now be pondering whether

I think we did a really good job. Most of the cars we overtook on track or we did it in the pitstops and we got to 12th. This year its a bit 5050 sometimes we get the qualifying right sometimes we get the race right., Alex Albon believes he and Williams executed a very good race at the Mexico City Grand Prix after narrowly missing out on a points finish with an encouraging rise from 19th at the end of the first lap to 12th at the chequered flag. Albon who scored in Australia Miami and Belgium earlier this season was just a few seconds shy of repeating the feat at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez as his Mercedespowered FW44 again displayed stronger pace in racetrim which helped the ThaiBritish driver to recover from a compromised start that cost him two places from 17th on the grid.

Most of the cars we overtook on track or we did it in the pitstops and we got to 12th. I felt like we did a very good job says Albon after climbing from P19 to 12th at the flag Considering where we were during practice on Friday on a circuit we knew was going to be difficult for us I felt like we did a very good job. Albon was then asked about Williams generally performing better on race days this season which prompted him to highlight how much progress the team have made in understanding their package  and how this should reap rewards in 2023. FACTS AND STATS Verstappen sets new season records for points and wins I think last year the team was maybe a little bit stronger in qualifying than the race. This year its a bit 5050 sometimes we get the qualifying right sometimes we get the race right. It is a bit of a moving board he commented. I think if you look at where we were at the start of the year and where we are now we generally really understand the cars weaknesses we get on top of them and we maximise the weekends. It puts us in a good place for development for next year because we understand the areas we need to work on. A very lonely and useless afternoon  Latifi reveals he was racing with a damaged car
Verstappen "incredibly proud" of F1 season wins record, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/verstappen-proud-f1-season-win-record/10393574/, It meant Verstappen surpassed the existing record jointly held by Michael Schumacher from 2004 and Sebastian Vettel from 2013 as well as claiming the record for the number of points scored in a single season with two races still remaining. Its just an incredible season for us as a team said Verstappen. But yeah of course Im incredibly proud.The season win record has been within Verstappens sightlines for some time but the Dutchman regularly downplayed the importance of the record and the possibility of getting there. Upon matching the record at the United States Grand Prix Verstappen noted the difference in eras and how F1 seasons now have more races. Schumachers 13race haul came in an 18race season while Vettel matched that number over 19 races in 2013., Listen to this article Having clinched his second F1 world title at Suzuka earlier this month Verstappen continued his dominant campaign by scoring his 14th win of the year in Sundays Mexican Grand Prix. It meant Verstappen surpassed the existing record jointly held by Michael Schumacher from 2004 and Sebastian Vettel from 2013 as well as claiming the record for the number of points scored in a single season with two races still remaining. Following his victory at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez Verstappen paid tribute to his Red Bull team for another great race after picking up its 16th win of the year and ninth in a row. Its just an incredible season for us as a team said Verstappen. I never thought I would be able to win 14 races in a year. But yeah of course Im incredibly proud.

Michael Schumacher Ferrari and Ross Brawn Technical Director after his 13th win of 2004 in Japan Photo by Sutton Images Asked by Motorsport.com after the race in Mexico if his decision to downplay it was a tactic to avoid losing focus Verstappen said he was unsure but that he was never really interested in stats. I just live in the moment Verstappen said. I just try to of course do the best I can every single weekend. I try to win the races and that for me is the most important. Every single weekend when I go home and I can say to myself that I maximised or close to that Im happy. But of course a lot in Formula 1 depends on your whole package  right And we are having a great package and Im just enjoying the moment. Im not that interested in keeping in touch with every stat. But of course it is an amazing season and of course Im very happy with winning so many races. Vettel insisted he has no regrets about losing the record that he shared with close friend and mentor Schumacher. No I mean every time its a bit different he said. I think its great for the team. I still know some people there so Im really happy for them and for Max. Well done. I think hes had a hell of a season so hopefully he gets 16 at the end of the year Everything else will be a disappointment no The Aston Martin driver agreed that sustaining such a level of success is not as easy as it might look from the outside. No its not he said. But obviously I think they had a momentum from last year the car this year is incredible. They won races even though they were heavier than everybody else. I think by now theyve probably got the weight out. So the car is there but Max is doing an amazing job as well.
TECH TUESDAY: The design secrets that set Red Bull’s RB18 apart from its F1 rivals, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.tech-tuesday-the-design-secrets-that-set-red-bulls-rb18-apart-from-its-f1.1ul2YIRb2nFywEwjYLWe0l.html, The Red Bull RB18 will go down as one of the most successful F1 cars in the sports history. Left At Paul Ricard Red Bull moved the two outermost tunnel inlet vanes further apart. Suspension Red Bull like McLaren responded to the new regulations by switching around their suspension from pushrod frontpullrod rear to the opposite. Inset right A beautiful detail is the adjustment of the ride height outside of the pedal box. Red Bull introduced a new engine cover at Silverstone with a channel between the upper and lower parts forming a bulge., The Red Bull RB18 will go down as one of the most successful F1 cars in the sports history. In taking Max Verstappen to his second world title and the team to their fifth constructors championship their first in nine years it has won 16 of the seasons 20 races to date  14 for Verstappen and two for Sergio Perez. It has proven to be a masterwork response to a set of radically new aerodynamic regulations which have been problematic for most other teams. Chief Technical Officer Adrian Newey feeds into the Red Bull technical group which created the car a group that includes Technical Director Pierre Wache Head of Aerodynamics Enrico Balbo Chief Engineering Officer Rob Marshall Chief Designer Craig Skinner Head of Performance Engineering Ben Waterhouse and Chief Engineer car Paul Monaghan. Newey has experience of ground effect cars from much earlier in his career and certainly he will have been aware of some of the possible hazards lying in wait with such a concept of car featuring an arodynamically superpowerful underbody. But Neweys actual design input in this case is limited to the suspension  though that is a crucial part of the cars allround excellence. READ MORE Verstappen makes F1 history as he beats Hamilton to victory in Mexico for 14th win of the season The car is powered by Hondas powerful reliable and compact RA621 a refinement of the power unit introduced in 2021. Around this Red Bull created a car with a distinctive and elegant sidepod layout with a deep undercut at the front beneath the inlet vanes to the venturi tunnels at the heart of the new regulations. Here we look at each of the key design elements of the car and what has differentiated it from its rivals. Verstappen and the RB18 have formed a dominant partnership this season winning 14 races out of 20 so far Floor The underfloor is absolutely key to performance under these regulations with downforce generated by tunnels either side of a central flat keel. The speed of the air flowing through these tunnels and the air pressure differential between the underfloor and the upper surface of the car creates massive downforce effectively sucking the car to the ground. READ MORE Hes been perfect  Horner full of praise after Verstappens recordbreaking victory But Red Bulls treatment of the tunnels is quite different to that of any other car. Others have created a teardropshaped central keel to shape the tunnels around but the Red Bulls keel is far less uniform in shape. The roof of the tunnels also appear to be higher and more arched. The combination of the profile changes of the keel and the varying height of the tunnels seems to be an effort at carefully matching the volume of the tunnel along its length to give a more consistent airflow and at no point has the car been seriously troubled by the porpoising phenomenon seen elsewhere. Ferrari underfloor left contrasted with that of Red Bull right. It can be seen that the central keel of the RB18 floor is nothing like the conventional teardrop shape on the F175. This seems to be part of a very careful matching with the height of the tunnels either side to give a more consistent volume for the airflow. This would theoretically lower the peak downforce generated by the floor but make it far more stallproof and tolerant of different ride heights. The key to these regulations has proved to be not how much peak downforce can be created by the floor through highspeed corners when the rear ride height is low but how much can be retained in slower corners when the ride height is greater. The Red Bulls floor arrangement is much more tolerant of ride height changes than others even if GPS data suggests it doesnt achieve as high a maximum downforce as the Ferrari or the Mercedes in faster corners. READ MORE I never thought Id be able to win 14 races in a year says recordbreaker Verstappen in Mexico Even the profile of the edges of the inlet vanes to the tunnel are nonuniform and seem to be matched to the profile of the tunnel. Red Bull used a variety of inlet vane and floor edge arrangements to tune the car to particular circuits. These changes would vary aero characteristics of the car and the centre of pressure acting upon the front and rear axles. It suggested the team had a very high fidelity control of its underfloor airflow. Left At Paul Ricard Red Bull moved the two outermost tunnel inlet vanes further apart. Although the team regularly tweaked the shape of these vanes to match specific circuit demands this was the biggest change. Right This tonguelike insert in the floor ahead of the rear tyres was introduced at Silverstone and is similar to a feature first seen on the Ferrari. Its believed to relieve excess pressure created in that part of the floor by tyre squirt at low ride heights. Suspension Red Bull like McLaren responded to the new regulations by switching around their suspension from pushrod frontpullrod rear to the opposite. Red Bull felt that the pullrod arrangement at the front  with the rockers up high  allowed a better airflow route to the tunnel inlets while at the rear a pushrod arrangement gave a better stiffer and lighter mechanical installation. Previously the high rockers of a pullrod rear had allowed more scope to powerfully develop the brake duct shapes but with these a standardised item for 2022 that scope was no longer there. MONDAY MORNING DEBRIEF How cunning strategy allowed us to see Ricciardo back at his best in Mexico The rear suspension had a notably long travel to accommodate a variety of ride heights. It would sink very low at high speed to reduce drag even though it usually had a greater static ride height than any other car. This was a key part of the cars consistent straightline speed advantage over the competition. To get the car to sink in such a way would require a relatively soft suspension springing rate and on other cars such a setting would induce bouncing. The Red Bull floors resistance to aerodynamic stalling was probably part of enabling the softer suspension to work. Main image Red Bulls 2022 front suspension in detail. Left inset Red Bulls 2021 pushrod layout. It is now the front upper arm which passes through the chassis whereas previously it was the front lower arm. That upper arm is mounted higher than the rear lower arm not visible here giving an antidive geometry. Inset right A beautiful detail is the adjustment of the ride height outside of the pedal box. On other cars notably the Mercedes the suspension had to be run stiff enough to keep the car outside of the ride heightspeed combinations which would induce bouncing at a frequency and would then cause the car to be bouncing on its tyre sidewalls too. The Red Bull was seemingly completely immune from this. At the front Newey had opted for a multilink arrangement once again with the upper forward link mounted high and the upper rearwards link lower to resist the dive of the car under braking thereby limiting the rear ride height increase and the downforce loss it entails. READ MORE 6 Winners and 5 Losers from the Mexico City Grand Prix  Who left the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez on a high A beautiful detail was having the ride height adjuster on the external part of the suspension usually its within the central part with the rockers for easy access. The multilink arrangement  with separate attachment points for the various suspension links  will be heavier but it allows those links to work more independently and thereby give a better ride quality. This gives a more stable aerodynamic platform. As a side benefit the car will be better over the kerbs. Red Bull introduced a new engine cover at Silverstone with a channel between the upper and lower parts forming a bulge. This both increased the cooling capacity and improved the airflow to the rear corner of the car normally two conflicting requirements.
Hamilton: Alonso’s comments about F1 titles "make me giggle a little bit", https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/hamilton-alonsos-comments-about-f1-titles-make-me-giggle-a-little-bit/10393547/, But in an apparent response to Alonsos comments Hamilton tweeted a picture of them on the podium together at Indianapolis in 2007 when they were teammates at McLaren accompanied with a single thumbs up emoji. Asked for his reaction to Alonsos comments and about the post Hamilton said I gave you my reaction. It does make me giggle a little bit to be honest but I have tried to be really respectful over the years. Lewis Hamilton McLaren and Fernando Alonso McLaren Photo by Steven Tee  Motorsport ImagesIts definitely interesting to see the comments that are made but it doesnt really matter. So thats why I just kind of put the thumbs up.Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff also brushed off Alonsos comments saying the twotime world champion was a teaser and it was comedy and that he doubted Hamilton cared., In an interview with Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf that was published last Saturday Alonso discussed the value of F1 titles won against drivers from other teams compared to those fought only against a teammate. Alonso took to Twitter after the quotes began to circulate to say that all titles are amazing and he was tired of the continuous search for headlines as well as suggesting F1 fans should stop being pitted against each other on social media. But in an apparent response to Alonsos comments Hamilton tweeted a picture of them on the podium together at Indianapolis in 2007 when they were teammates at McLaren accompanied with a single thumbs up emoji. Hamilton won that race ahead of Alonso who was left fuming at his McLaren team amid a tense season that resulted in Alonso leaving at the end of the year. Asked for his reaction to Alonsos comments and about the post Hamilton said I gave you my reaction. Thats my thumbs up. I dont really have a lot to say about it. It does make me giggle a little bit to be honest but I have tried to be really respectful over the years. For example when youve ever asked me about who has been the better driver for me Ive always tried to give praise. Lewis Hamilton McLaren and Fernando Alonso McLaren Photo by Steven Tee  Motorsport Images Its definitely interesting to see the comments that are made but it doesnt really matter. So thats why I just kind of put the thumbs up. Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff also brushed off Alonsos comments saying the twotime world champion was a teaser and it was comedy and that he doubted Hamilton cared. It creates headlines and this sport is about headlines said Wolff. Theyre great champions. Alonso likes to throw one in. I dont think its bothering Lewis a millimetre. In the wake of the response to his comments Alonso said on Sunday when asked about Max Verstappens new win record that he would not speak any more about anyone else because I think theres always misunderstanding. It was not the first time there had been some tension emerging from comments Alonso made about Hamilton this year. Following their collision on the opening lap of the Belgian Grand Prix in August Alonso called Hamilton an idiot over team radio and claimed the seventime world champion could only race starting first. He later apologised for the comment.
‘I’m hoping it’s not a trend’ says Binotto after Ferrari’s lacklustre performance in Mexico, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.im-hoping-its-not-a-trend-says-binotto-after-ferraris-lacklustre-performance.742BKVgS7q55tOB51tG36X.html, But team boss Mattia Binotto was keen to take some positives from the race especially concerning strategy which has been an Achilles heel for the team at times this season. Mercedes is coming back theyve looked more competitive than we did here Binotto said after the race. Lewis Hamilton has been in contention for the win on the past two race weekends  but Binotto doesnt believe that his team have slipped as much down the pecking order as the time sheets in Mexico would indicate. The one after  Japan  yes it was very wet we were not as fast as Max Verstappen but it was not a drama certainly not in quali he said. Then in the States in Austin again I think in the quali we were competitive then not as much as we expected in the race., Carlos Sainz predicted a sixway fight for the win in Mexico but come race day Mercedes and Red Bull were the ones contesting the victory while Ferrari fell off the pace and finished nearly a minute behind their rivals with Sainz fifth and Charles Leclerc in sixth. But team boss Mattia Binotto was keen to take some positives from the race especially concerning strategy which has been an Achilles heel for the team at times this season. READ MORE It was really lonely  Leclerc and Sainz reflect on disappointing outing for Ferrari in Mexico But while their decision to start on the soft tyres and finish on the mediums should have paid dividends it was a lack of power that seemed to be their downfall at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez. The altitude could have been a factor  coupled with the fact that unlike their rivals they opted to switch focus to developing their 2023 car at a pretty early stage this year. Mercedes is coming back theyve looked more competitive than we did here Binotto said after the race. We know we stopped development on our car quite early focussing on 2023 and somehow Im not too let me say concerned by the rate of development because I know when we stopped developing it. Leclerc has slipped five points behind Perez in the drivers standings now With both titles long since wrapped up by Red Bull and Max Verstappen it may seem there is little left to play for but finishing P2 in the constructors championship is still the teams target and one that is not a foregone conclusion given Mercedes are 40 points behind them but have been in much improved form at the last two races. Lewis Hamilton has been in contention for the win on the past two race weekends  but Binotto doesnt believe that his team have slipped as much down the pecking order as the time sheets in Mexico would indicate. MUSTSEE Get all the angles as McLaren nail the first subtwo second pit stop of 2022 Certainly if I look at the last three races it has not always been great but Singapore we were very competitive. The one after  Japan  yes it was very wet we were not as fast as Max Verstappen but it was not a drama certainly not in quali he said. Then in the States in Austin again I think in the quali we were competitive then not as much as we expected in the race. Here Mexico I think its a lot worse so I dont think its the same trend Singapore competitive Japan not too bad USA good quali so I think here it has been a lot more difficult and Im hoping its not a trend just an outlying weekend for us. Sainz at least saw the chequered flag on Sunday for the first time since Singapore
How F1 teams reacted to Mexico’s high-altitude headaches, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/how-f1-teams-reacted-to-mexicos-high-altitude-headaches/10393735/, All of this leads to teams running what might otherwise be considered odd choices given its such a highspeed venue. It was a similar story at the rear of the car too as both drivers flirted with different arrangements. The team also had the option of incorporating a Gurney flap on the trailing edge of the main engine cover outlet in order to help with extraction. Alpha Tauri AT03 cooling panel comparisonMeanwhile at the rear of the car the engine covers bodywork was expanded. This not only increased the size of the rear cooling outlet but also resulted in a larger rear deck upon which the air flowed to the rear of the car., Listen to this article At 2285m above sea level the rarefied air creates a significant challenge in respect of car aerodynamics cooling requirements and the performance envelope of the power unit. All of this leads to teams running what might otherwise be considered odd choices given its such a highspeed venue. Mercedes experimented with its wing levels on Friday not only as a means to hone in on the performance levels of the car at this venue but also for gathering meaningful data for next years car too. Comparing the two front wings put into service during free practice outings Lewis Hamiltons car was fitted with the older specification version with the trailing edge of the upper flap cut back quite significantly left image below. Meanwhile George Russells W13 was fitted with the new wing design which features a revised design to the outer section of the flaps and a more contoured endplate to help generate outwash. However the team did opt to remove the controversial slot gap separator brackets that first appeared at the United States Grand Prix but remain unraced. Youll also note that chequerboard stickers were adhered to the front wing endplate on Hamiltons car with a camera used to capture footage of the wing whilst its out on track in order that the team can ascertain its performing as anticipated. It was a similar story at the rear of the car too as both drivers flirted with different arrangements. George Russell carried a Gurney flap mounted on the trailing edge of the rear wing whilst Hamilton matching the cutdown approach taken with the front wing was running the wing without one on his. Following the tests conducted by Hamilton on Friday both drivers opted for the newer front wing specification with a more loaded flap arrangement plus the Gurney on the trailing edge of the rear wings upper flap for qualifying and the race. Meanwhile the maximum cooling option was taken up on both cars with the panels beside the cockpit and the engine cover gills both opened up in order to reject the heat being generated. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes W13 Photo by Steven Tee  Motorsport Images Red Bull also opted for more cooling to meet the demands being posed as the RB18 ran with the louvred cooling panels on the shoulder of the engine cover and a new wider cooling exit at the rear that also flared on the trailing edge to help with extraction. McLaren decided to take cooling in Mexico pretty seriously as several new options appeared in order to deal with the demands posed by the circuit and altitude. A more expansive louvred cooling panel could be found traversing the MCL36s sidepod and engine cover with two outlets also added to its cooling suite on the engine covers spine one of these is mounted above the power unit saddle coolers and the other is just aft of the shark fin red arrows. The team also had the option of incorporating a Gurney flap on the trailing edge of the main engine cover outlet in order to help with extraction. To increase local load at the rear of the car McLaren had also made changes to its rear brake duct aero adding some winglets to the stack already present on the rearwardfacing outlet scoop. Alpine also deployed its maximum cooling configuration as the A522 was fitted with the open louvred sidepod bodywork and the enlarged engine cover outlet panel that was last seen in Hungary but not raced. Alpine F1 A522 cooling detail Photo by Giorgio Piola Alpha Tauri invested in revisions to help with its temperature issues in Mexico too as the AT03s front brakes featured an enlarged rear outlet scoop resulting in an increase in mass flow through the assembly. The cooling gill panel on the side of the engine cover was also revised with the number of louvres reduced but their spacing increased as they still filled the same available space within the panel. Alpha Tauri AT03 cooling panel comparison Meanwhile at the rear of the car the engine covers bodywork was expanded. This not only increased the size of the rear cooling outlet but also resulted in a larger rear deck upon which the air flowed to the rear of the car. Alfa Romeo has been proactive in the closing stages of the season as it not only looks to fend off the challenge posed by Aston Martin but also invest in designs that will carry across to its 2023 challenger. And whilst not a new feature having been used at other high downforce venues the larger rear wing endplate tip cutout used in Mexico is a feature worthy of our attention owing to its impact on the resultant tip vortex being generated. Alfa Romeo C42 rear wing cutout comparison Photo by Giorgio Piola Compared with the medium downforce wings cutout inset theres a clear difference in approach with its high downforce arrangement as the flap is undercut red arrow. This is the result of the team looking for a better tradeoff between the downforce and drag being generated given it is trying to maintain as much wingspan as possible. The team has also made changes to the forward section of the floor over the course of the last two races as it looks to increase the downforce being generated and its working range. This includes changes to the outermost floor fence and the point at which it connects with the side of the chassis.
The last time a Formula 1 team fell out with a TV broadcaster, https://www.planetf1.com/news/formula-1-team-tv-broadcaster-fallout/, Max Verstappen and Red Bull pressed mute on broadcaster Sky Sports in Mexico although it was not the first example of a media spat in Formula 1. Then postrace Sky used mixedzone interviews with Verstappen and his teammate Sergio Perez while Red Bull team principal Christian Horner who usually appears for an interview at every round did not do so. But this year its been a constant yeah kind of like daily being disrespectful especially one particular person said Verstappen. Renault had previously blocked the Dutch broadcaster from onetoone access with Daniel Ricciardo as they reportedly wanted to ask the Australian if Verstappen was better than him. Read more Christian Horner discusses decision to support Max Verstappens Sky F1 boycott, Max Verstappen and Red Bull pressed mute on broadcaster Sky Sports in Mexico although it was not the first example of a media spat in Formula 1. Word surfaced that Verstappen had taken issue with Sky Sports coverage relating to one individual at the broadcaster in particular believed to be their pitlane reporter Ted Kravitz who on several occasions had used the word robbed when discussing how Lewis Hamilton had missed out on the 2021 title to Verstappen. With Red Bull said to have joined in Verstappens silence multiple occurrences during Skys Mexican Grand Prix race coverage suggested that was true starting with Martin Brundles grid walk when he had the opportunity to approach Red Bulls design chief Adrian Newey but did not. Then postrace Sky used mixedzone interviews with Verstappen and his teammate Sergio Perez while Red Bull team principal Christian Horner who usually appears for an interview at every round did not do so. Verstappen postrace confirmed his stance and explained it. It had nothing to do with this weekend. But this year its been a constant yeah kind of like daily being disrespectful especially one particular person said Verstappen. And its enough I dont accept it. You cant live in the past. You just have to move on. Social media is a very toxic place and if you are constantly being like that live on TV you make it only worse instead of trying to make it better. You keep disrespecting me and at one point Im not tolerating it anymore. Thats why I decided to stop answering them. Horner has said Verstappen and the Red Bull team will be talking to Sky at the next event the Sao Paulo Grand Prix so bar any further fallouts that should be the end of the matter. But fallouts with the media are not unheard of  just ask Renault. In 2020 Ziggo Sports Jack Plooij issued an apology after he called Renault driver Esteban Ocon a French f on live television while he was interviewing Lando Norris. Ocon accepted the apology although that was not the first time Ziggo Sport had found themselves in hot water with Renault. Renault had previously blocked the Dutch broadcaster from onetoone access with Daniel Ricciardo as they reportedly wanted to ask the Australian if Verstappen was better than him.

Binotto: Mercedes' strategy calls show not only Ferrari make mistakes, https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1016141/1/binotto-mercedes-strategy-calls-show-not-only-ferrari-make-mistakes, Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto whose teams strategy has come under scrutiny several times this season thinks Mercedes threw away two potential victories. Mercedes maybe have lost the last race as well by not choosing the right tyres in Austin. I think we would have still had the edge but they Mercedes would have been a lot closer Horner said. He controlled the race from the very beginning on those soft tyres not warming them up too quickly making sure there was longevity to them he added. But I think that the onestop mediumhard looked like the right strategy., Lewis Hamilton has been forced to settle for runnerup spot behind Red Bulls Max Verstappen at consecutive races in Austin and Mexico City as he missed the chance to end his and Mercedes winless drought in 2022.

In Hungary we have been criticised and its normally when we are doing things which are not completely right we are criticised he said. Mercedes maybe have lost the last race as well by not choosing the right tyres in Austin. So I think its not only down to us somehow to make different choices or making mistakes. Binotto said it was always clear to Ferrari that running a softtomedium strategy was the best way to go in Mexico. We saw that there was not much degradation on the soft or sufficient to run a onestop softmedium and we went for it he explained. Certainly then in the race we had as well to manage our tyres to make sure that were surviving on a onestop and that maybe as well is part of the cause of our slow pace of today. So managing tyres has been certainly an item a subject for us today. But still we believe that softmedium was the right choice for the race. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner also took a swipe at rivals Mercedes revealing his surprise at their tyre strategy. I think we would have still had the edge but they Mercedes would have been a lot closer Horner said. You could hear their drivers were not very happy about the hard tyre and thats the second weekend in a row that theyve put that tyre on and its cost them a victory so I was quite surprised at that. Horner also praised Verstappens tyremanagement describing it as masterful. He controlled the race from the very beginning on those soft tyres not warming them up too quickly making sure there was longevity to them he added. Actually when they came off the car there was still a lot of life left in them. That gave us even more confidence that the medium tyre would be fine as a onestop. It was a question of not abusing that tyre which is something he has been masterful at this year. Mercedes admit tactical error Both Hamilton and teammate George Russell were unhappy with their hard tyres and questioned Mercedes decision in Mexico. After Sundays race Toto Wolff admitted his team made a mistake in hindsight. In hindsight its always easier to judge he said. But I think that the onestop mediumhard looked like the right strategy. That the medium at the end held on for so long came as a surprise. But the hindsight is the thing. If we were to restart the race maybe we would choose a different tyre. Wolff added We felt the soft was strong when we discussed it this morning but not strong enough to really go 30 laps or so. Our models said that a softhard would go. Our models didnt say that a softmedium would go. It could have been to lose more time on the medium and hang it out there for another five six laps and then try to do 30 laps on the soft. But also that was not a given that it would hold on with Daniel you could see that it was possible. Wolff also conceded Mexico likely presented Mercedes with their best chance of winning a race this season. On the simulations it says yes he concluded.

The compromise that forced Ferrari into a dire F1 weekend, https://the-race.com/formula-1/the-compromise-that-forced-ferrari-into-a-dire-f1-weekend/, Its been 113 days since Ferrari won a Formula 1 race and its a wait that might continue for quite some time based on its hopeless Mexican Grand Prix weekend. That led to Ferrari deciding to compromise its power unit performance in Mexico to ensure it wouldnt suffer from similar reliability problems. That compromise centred around the turbo in Ferraris power unit which is smaller than the turbos used by its rivals. Binotto also indicated that Ferrari would need a full review to find out exactly what went so badly wrong. A full review followed that race where Ferrari appeared to understand its problems and rectify them for another lowdownforce track at Monza two weeks later., Its been 113 days since Ferrari won a Formula 1 race and its a wait that might continue for quite some time based on its hopeless Mexican Grand Prix weekend. Ironically arguably its worst performance of 2022 in Mexico City has its roots in one of its finest races of the year at the Austrian Grand Prix where Charles Leclerc took Ferraris last grand prix victory. While Leclerc passed Verstappen three times to win at the Red Bull Ring his teammate Carlos Sainz was denied a chance to make it a Ferrari 12 when his car caught fire. The Austrian circuit is one of the higheraltitude tracks on the calendar but Mexico Citys altitude is over three times as high. That led to Ferrari deciding to compromise its power unit performance in Mexico to ensure it wouldnt suffer from similar reliability problems. That compromise centred around the turbo in Ferraris power unit which is smaller than the turbos used by its rivals. Smaller turbos can generate as much power as larger turbos by running faster and they need to run even faster when the air is thinner at high altitudes like in Mexico. The level at which Ferraris smaller turbo would have needed to run at would have put it at risk of a failure so it elected to turn down the power of the turbo. This stripped what had previously been an advantage away from Ferrari as usually its smaller turbo requires less electrical energy and subsequently has a significant acceleration advantage out of the corners. Sainz and Leclerc were therefore powerless to do any better than fifth and sixth in the race finishing almost a minute behind race winner Max Verstappen  Ferraris biggest race deficit of 2022. And what makes that deficit even worse is the fact that Ferrari  unlike on numerous prior occasions in the 2022 F1 season  was on completely the right race strategy. It has certainly been a very difficult weekend team boss Mattia Binotto admitted after the race. Already yesterday in qualifying we were quite behind the pole position Sainz was 0.576 seconds adrift of pole and only 0.05s quicker than the Alfa Romeo of Valtteri Bottas who beat his teammate Leclerc normally in the qualy we are quite competitive. In the race it has simply emphasised that we were not comfortable with the track this weekend. Our overall performance has not been great no doubt. We were off the pace in the race. The compromise that both of the drivers are mentioning we were not at our best performance for the weekend in terms of the power unit. Ferraris flaws title failure and relief  Leclerc interview Read more But Binotto was quick to stress that the power unit compromise was only part of the equation and not the only cause with FP2 being used as a tyre test among the other contributing factors. However the compromise likely affected other areas such as the challenge of trying to find the right balance and setup with a different power output to any other race this year and the aforementioned nullification of Ferraris typical 2022 acceleration advantage. This likely contributed to a somewhat erratic F175 this weekend that looked nervous on the kerbs and through the Esses section in particular. It was a fight. Thats why I couldnt put a lap together Sainz said after qualifying and Leclercs off in second practice was further evidence of the imbalance. But it clearly doesnt explain all of Ferraris woes and continues a worrying trend for Ferrari in the second half of a 2022 season that it started with the fastest car. Binotto also indicated that Ferrari would need a full review to find out exactly what went so badly wrong. The team has been here before. It suffered a miserable weekend in Spa after the summer break as it was utterly powerless to stop Verstappen from romping from 14th on the grid to win while Leclerc finished sixth and well over a minute back despite starting one place behind Verstappen. A full review followed that race where Ferrari appeared to understand its problems and rectify them for another lowdownforce track at Monza two weeks later. Already in Spa it has been very similar where we have been very slow and it was more outstanding anomalous in terms of bad pace said Binotto. Here is similar its something we need to look at and try to react to for the last two races. Reacting in Brazil might be tough as the Interlagos circuit is marginally higher than the Red Bull Ring venue that prompted Ferraris adjustment. Its still way off the altitude that forced Ferraris most extreme power unit compromise of the season but we still may see a smaller one in Brazil to avoid further reliability issues at a time where DNFs would leave it vulnerable to Mercedes in the constructors championship.
Wolff pinpoints 'single decision last October' as the reason behind Mercedes' 2022 performance | Formula 1�, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.wolff-pinpoints-single-decision-last-october-as-the-reason-behind-mercedes.1kLKRTyZBApInVtk2Lh8bb.html, Toto Wolff believes a development call some 12 months ago was the moment Mercedes got it wrong with the development of their 2022 car as he reflected on the teams efforts to bring the W13 up to speed.

But team principal Horner has updated about their stance There were some derogatory comments made so we took a break from Sky for this race. 5 Tracks That F1 NEED to Bring Back Video of 5 Tracks That F1 NEED to Bring Back Max was upset. We were upset and we made the decision to stand together as a team. It wont have done Sky any harm for us to lay down a marker. Some of the commentary is fair but some pieces are sensationalist and saying we robbed anyone of the championship as was said in Austin is going too far. It is not impartial or fair or balanced. We have said our piece and will go back to normal next race. What did Ted Kravitz say After the F1 United States Grand Prix he said Lewis Hamilton doesnt win a race all year and then finally comes back at a track where he could win the first race all year battling the same guy who won the race he was robbed in the previous year and manages to finish ahead of him. What a script and a story that would have been. But thats not the way the script turned out today was it Because the guy that beat him after being robbed actually overtook him because hes got a quicker car because of engineering and Formula One and design and pretty much because of Adrian Newey Red Bulls chief technical officer over there. What was Max Verstappens response Its been a constant kind of like digging being disrespectful especially one particular person  and at one point it is enough I dont accept it.

However due to red flags caused by other drivers during a Friday FP1 practice session with Williams in Mexico City Sargeant amassed just 96 kmmeaning he fell one lap short. Nonetheless Sargeant is on a healthy 30 points and is in line to comfortably reach the 40point threshold if he has a smooth final Formula 2 weekend in Abu Dhabi. And he is still learning. Williams has said that Sergeant will replace Nicholas Latifiif Sargeant can complete is Super License requirement. I was definitely a lot more comfortable said Sargeant after his session. Everything slowed down a lot and it was easier to build a rhythm and learn the track. All in all it was a good step forward and good progress from last weekend in Austin. Chinas 2023 F1 Hosting Hopes Fading The pandemic has kept Formula 1 from China since 2019. Charles Coates Getty Images China has not featured on Formula 1s calendar since 2019 due to the pandemic and the countrys Covid Zero policyto which Chinese president Xi Jinping recently recommitted means it effectively remains cutoff from the remainder of the world. There are still strict entry measures and quarantine which is currently immutable for Formula 1. Next years event is scheduled for April 16 but it is understood that it is an unlikely proposition. In the case that such a scenario unfolds. Formula 1 would not replace China reducing the calendar from 24 to 23 Grands Prix which still remains a record. One schedule change should China fall off the calendar would be for Azerbaijan scheduled for April 30 to move one week earlier. That would avoid having Azerbaijan and Miami race on backtoback weekends. Few in the paddock are looking forward to that backtoback scheduling. Hamiltons Little Alonso Dig Lewis Hamilton is not one to get shortchanged on social media. Eric Alonso Getty Images Fernando Alonso has taken to making sly remarks at some of his opponents across the years and in an interview with Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf he suggested that Max Verstappens two titles were worthier than Lewis Hamiltons seven. Once the headline was out Alonso made an attempt to clarify his comments insisting drivers shouldnt be compared but Hamilton got his dig at Alonso with a very cheeky post on Twitter. This content is imported from Twitter. You may be able to find the same content in another format or you may be able to find more information at their web site. It does make me giggle a little bit to be honest but I have tried to be really respectful over the years and for example when youve ever asked me about who has been the better driver for me Ive always tried to give praise said Hamilton when asked about the post. But its definitely interesting to see the comments that are made but it doesnt really matter. So thats why I just kind of put the thumbs up. De Vries Gets Abu Dhabi Test Nyck de Vries practices with Mercedes in Mexico City. Jam Media Getty Images Nyck de Vries has been a busy man. De Vries has fulfilled young driver duties for employers Mercedes Aston Martin and Williams had a private outing with Alpine and also made an impressive lastminute race debut for Williams which captured the attention of AlphaTauri. With Mercedes having released de Vries for 2023 AlphaTauri will run de Vries for a full day at the postseason young driver test in Abu Dhabi on November 22. That means De Vries will end up driving for half of the 10 teams in a window of around three months. Too Busy Mexico City Paddock Lewis Hamilton center makes his way through a crowded paddock in Mexico City. Peter J Fox Getty Images Drivers and the FIA are set to talk at the next briefing in Brazil over paddock overcrowding. Formula 1s popularity has ballooned in recent years but there were more than a few occasions of drivers being seriously accosted when trying to manoeuvre their way around what remains a work environment. Drivers are cognizant of the need to satisfy fans but frequently in Mexico City especially among the leading contingent they were mobbed. Several spoke afterward of the need for fans particularly adults to respect boundaries with security having been tightened due to the situation. Mexico Citys paddock is one of the most vibrant and enthusiastic of the campaign but for 2023 there will surely be some additional measures put in place.

The eighttime race winner now looks set to take a year off either away from the sport completely or with a reserve role at Mercedes or Red Bull with the hope of getting back into F1 in 2024. Button however believes that is the wrong decision for his future.

Even though there is a stark contrast between Formula 1 drivers zooming 200 mph and golfers taking 5 hours to play a round the science and engineering behind the equipment both sports use is more similar than you might think. For starters both sports adhere to strict rules set forth by governing bodies. In Formula 1s case that is FIA Fdration Internationale de lAutomobile in golf rulesmaking duties are shared by the USGA United States Golf Association and RA Royal  Ancient. FIA and USGA regulate their respective sports FIAUSGA The biggest contrast between the two sports regulations is that golfs rules are universal i.e. they apply to any competition regardless of skill level in any professional or amateur event while F1 rules apply only to that specific league. F1 regulations are also constantly shifting based on technology while golfs base rules have been around for longer than automobiles have existed. These regulations force engineers to look for any possible advantage written within the rules to create a legal advantage versus other teams. In the case of golf each manufacturer has its own philosophy when it comes to designing equipment geared toward their stable of players just as some F1 cars are tuned to driving styles. Aerodynamics play a huge part in design Formula One  FIA One of the best comparisons from golf to F1 is how some teams prioritize straightline speed vs. cornering in the same way some golf OEMs put a priority on forgiveness vs. trying to create extra workability. Engineers in both sports have to strike the perfect balance of which attributes they believe are going to offer the most competitive edge. The advantage golf club engineers have is they can segment their designs to fit various demographics of golfers Formula 1 engineers meanwhile can design only one car. The hypercompetitive nature of golf and Formula 1 has engineers and designers keeping ideas close to their vests and constantly pushing the limits to find performance within the rules. In both sports engineers will go as far as looking beyond the wording of regulations to find different interpretations of how the rules are written. In golf this process is cut and dry  a piece of equipment is either conforming or nonconforming but that doesnt mean engineers wont get a little weird. Ping Doc17 putter Ping Golf The Ping Doc17 to this day is one of the wildest examples of a putter that pushed the rules to the absolute limit. The 17 in Doc17 represents the length of the face from heel to toe in centimeters. The USGA limit is set at 17.78 cm but Doc17 sounds way better than Doc17.78. Formula 1 engineers get a little more outside of the box. An example of this is how Aston Martin redesigned their rear wing based on the radii set within the regulations. Aston Martins modified 2022 rear wing design Formula One There is a whole bunch of stuff going on here but in the simplest terms by continuing the radius of the side wing to create a round rail Aston Martin kept the top of the side wing whole compared to others that have a small channel that flows down to connect to the car. Ferraris F1 rear wing design Giorgio Piola Just like how every improved mishit helps keep a golf ball online every partial second gained per lap in a 190mile F1 race adds up and can be the difference between being in the points the top 10 in F1 and going home with nothing. Lastly just as golfers tune their equipment to different course styles and ground conditions F1 races are conducted all over the world meaning tweaks need to be made to the car the same way golfers need to adjust club selection at altitude. The recent Mexico Grand Prix held in Mexico City was well above sea level and the less dense air had cars traveling faster for the same reason a golf ball travels farther  less air resistance equals more output for the same input. Now if we could only get PGA Tour players to finish a round in the same time it takes an F1 driver to complete 190 miles we might find a way to pick up the pace of play.

Ten things we learned from the 2022 F1 Mexican GP, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/10-things-we-learned-from-the-2022-mexican-grand-prix/10393435/, Listen to this articleTheres little escaping that the Mexican Grand Prix last weekend ultimately failed to deliver on the thrilling climax it teased at certain points. All told here are 10 things we learned from the 2022 Mexican Grand Prix. Red Bull therefore took umbrage with the sensationalisation and chose the Mexico weekend to stop giving exclusive interviews to Sky Sports. Red Bull which did similar by pulling interviews with Sky at Abu Dhabi last year says normal service will be resumed for Brazil. The excess is down to failing to include elements such as social security contributions for staff apprenticeship levies cost of use of the power units and a clerical error in the calculation of costs recharged to Red Bull by Red Bull Powertrains among others., Listen to this article Theres little escaping that the Mexican Grand Prix last weekend ultimately failed to deliver on the thrilling climax it teased at certain points. That meant at a time when the FIA went public with its contentious punishment for Red Bull breaking the 2021 cost cap there was an equal split between on and offtrack talking points. Max Verstappen writing his name into more pages of the history books as he broke another two Formula 1 records thanks to his latest victory Mercedes upping the pace but coming overall conservative with its strategy plus a rejuvenated showing from Daniel Ricciardo were among the lean highlights from the 71 laps of the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez. Away from the asphalt the atmosphere at high altitude was a lot more fraught. Sky Sports couldnt cut to Christian Horner on the pitwall as Red Bull boycotted the broadcaster just hours after the team had been busy explaining its exceeding of the budget cap. Fernando Alonso finally had a resolution to the protest of the protest of his result in the United States Grand Prix and its looking like both the Mexico round and Lewis Hamilton will be sticking around for a little while longer. All told here are 10 things we learned from the 2022 Mexican Grand Prix. Max Verstappen celebrates a recordbreaking 14th win in a single season Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images 1. Victorious Verstappen has broken another two F1 records While there were some complaints from the cockpit of the 1 RB18 during the first stint as his soft tyres began to tear polesitter Max Verstappen would soon take total control of the 71 laps in Mexico City and come to look unflappable on his way to victory by 15.186s over Lewis Hamilton. The twotime world champions latest triumph increased his tally of wins in 2022 up to 14 which meant he surpassed the 13strong record shared by Sebastian Vettel 2013 and Michael Schumacher 2004 for the most successful season in Formula 1 history. Verstappens reaction was Another great race but also its just an incredible season for us as a team. I never thought I would be able to win 14 races in a year. Im incredibly proud. Quite astonishingly that wasnt the only record Verstappen broke when he reached the chequered flag. With the full score of 25 for first place secured the Dutch ace now counts 416 points for his efforts this year. That meant he moved clear of Hamiltons 2019 record of 413 and thats still with two races including a sprint round to go. But even if Verstappen claims the spoils in Brazil and Abu Dhabi his win percentage will fall just shy of Alberto Ascaris 75 in 1952. On the points score Verstappen added Hopefully we can score a few more but its not about that. At the end of the day its all about trying to win a championship and it doesnt matter with how many points you do it but it does show we are having an incredible year. Mercedes reticence to take a gamble in Mexico cost it a shot at victory Photo by Steven Tee  Motorsport Images 2. Mercedes played it much too safe to end its winless run It surely seemed as though the United States Grand Prix offered Mercedes its best chance of getting off the mark in 2022. Max Verstappen was held for 15s in a calamitous pitstop. That Lewis Hamilton couldnt then hold off the chasing Red Bull to win indicated that only a major malady befalling the lead RB18 might put the W13s on the top step of the podium. But that sentiment only lasted seven days. With Verstappen leading away on softs before struggling with degradation while Hamilton and George Russell ran longer on their starting medium tyres it appeared as though a cute Silver Arrows strategy and decent management of the rubber could put the duo in contention for victory more or less on merit. Onehalf of that attack was subdued when Hamilton stopped for hard tyres to carry him to the flag but the whitewalled rubber immediately dropped him off the pace. Even race engineer Peter Bonnington struggled to justify the call over team radio. No matter Russell had stayed out longer was still happy on the mediums showing consistent pace and was telling the pitwall to keep him out until it was time for a sprint on soft tyres to the end. Then he too was stopped for hard tyres. Likewise his progress was slowed. That meant Russell had been kept out to no good effect as Mercedes effectively secured its driver of fourth place rather than at least ask questions of their rival outfit by putting late pressure on Verstappen and Sergio Perez  even if it would have required Russell passing both on track. Likewise Mercedes kept both its drivers on the same strategy rather than twist to stand a better chance of causing an upset. That was the bad news for Mercedes. And the bad news for spectators and TV viewers is that any kind of crescendo to a tame Mexican GP fizzled out almost entirely. Having struggled with the altitude in Mexico Ferrari crossed the line in a distant 56 finish Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images 3. Ferrari is on course to finish this promising campaign with a whimper Bar a sticking frontright wheel change that cost Carlos Sainz a second at his pitstop it was virtually an anonymous outing for Ferrari. The two red cars were more conspicuous for their absence from the lead fight as Sainz crossed the line nigh on a minute adrift of victor Max Verstappen as he clocked fifth to his teammates sixth. It was the Scuderias worst result since Leclerc crashed out of the lead of the French Grand Prix. The Mexico weekend was particularly troublesome for Ferrari as it managed only fifth and seventh in qualifying with Leclerc constantly fighting a twitchy F175 and even shunting backwards into the wall in FP2. The pair were split by Valtteri Bottas on Saturday who was only 0.05s shy of being the fastest Ferraripowered driver of the lot. Team boss Mattia Binotto put some of the blame on the power unit and having to turn down the turbo in highaltitude conditions. While internal expectations are for a return to form in Brazil it wasnt quite a oneoff to instantly forget and move on from. Although the pressure of both titles is now off to leave the team to focus on executing clean strategy and perfect pitstops Sainz failed to finish in both Japan and the United States  although he was the innocent party at Austin. Leclerc meanwhile copped a penalty at Suzuka for missing the chicane because he was running out of ideas to keep a faster Sergio Perez behind. Then in America having once been part of a threecar fight for the lead after recovering so strongly from an engine change penalty he dropped 7.5s back with tyre degradation. If Nico Rosbergs 2016 title success was launched off the back of his stellar end to 2015 these recent races suggest Ferrari isnt striving to copy a similar strategy. Daniel Ricciardo enjoyed arguably his best performance of 2022 with a vintage attacking display Photo by Mark Sutton  Motorsport Images 4. Ricciardo offers a reminder of his Red Bull and Renault peak Daniel Ricciardo will not race in F1 in 2023 unless making a substitute appearance as part of his widely expected move to become a reserve driver. This he hopes will better position him to join a more competitive team in time for 2024. That is a strategic gamble. One which if it backfires could lead to the Australian bowing out of his GP career in two races time without anyone really acknowledging the occasion. The eighttime F1 race winner remains hugely popular so few want to see that set of events unfold. But should they transpire the Mexican GP gave many a reminder of the driver the championship would be missing out on. Granted Ricciardos move on Yuki Tsunoda that eliminated the AlphaTauri was clumsy  a far cry from the flawless lick the stamp and send it moves that meant Ricciardo could pass at will from miles back into the first chicane at Monza for example. Rightly he copped a 10s penalty. Also it must be considered that his late turn of pace was due to running with the soft tyre. Nevertheless after pitting on lap 44 Ricciardo delivered arguably the finest stint of his admittedly dismal campaign. His management of the medium tyres to nurse them to nearly twothirds race distance was impressive as he worked his way from 11th to eighth. Then came his charge as he passed Tsunoda one way or another forced McLaren to ask Lando Norris to move aside Valtteri Bottas and both Alpines to score seventh. Such was his turn of speed that he cleared away from Esteban Ocon to effectively render his penalty meaningless as he didnt drop a place and was voted Driver of the Day by viewers. After nudging Lance Stroll off the road Pierre Gasly is perilously close to a race ban Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images 5. Gasly is enduring an agonising AlphaTauri arrivederci At a cursory glance just missing out on scoring points in 11th might seem like no mean feat for Pierre Gasly in view of the uninspiring form of the AlphaTauri throughout much of this season. That classification and a strong second stint on the optimal soft tyres to gain places late on however still dont entirely mask recent weekends dogged by underperformance and absolute frustration from a driver who only has two races left at the team before his move to Alpine for 2023. The iffy batch of brakes hurt both AT03 drivers in Japan and yet Yuki Tsunoda made the most of a bad lot to qualify well ahead of Gasly. A similar story was true of Mexico when as both contended with a lack of grip on the lesserused asphalt again Tsunoda was the faster of the duo. Gasly was then overzealous in his battle to get back past the Aston Martin of Lance Stroll who had nicked him at the start. That earned a 5s penalty to go with his reprimands at Suzuka and Austin and is he now seriously running the risk of a race ban for racking up too many penalty points on his licence. Its become a run of bad form rather than just poor luck. Whats more all the incidents have been accompanied by the soundtrack of Gaslys fury over team radio just as he is ready to bid the team for which he has started 94 of his 106 grands prix farewell. Red Bull turned its back on Sky through the weekend having been unhappy with criticism from the broadcaster Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images 6. Red Bull wasnt talking to sensationalist Sky Sports Among all the excitement of Brad Pitt rocking up to the United States Grand Prix Sky Sports reporter Ted Kravitz was supposing what the plot of the forthcoming Formula 1 Hollywood blockbuster might be. His source material was the 2021 title fight in which he repeatedly referred to a driver being robbed of the championship spoils. The subtext was more like plain text. Red Bull therefore took umbrage with the sensationalisation and chose the Mexico weekend to stop giving exclusive interviews to Sky Sports. No cutting to Christian Horner midrace as his leg shakes on the pitwall. No postrace debriefs with Max Verstappen Sergio Perez and so on  the UK TV rights holder had to make do with splicing in clips of the Red Bull protagonists speaking to the central F1TV interviewers. Red Bull which did similar by pulling interviews with Sky at Abu Dhabi last year says normal service will be resumed for Brazil. Red Bull accepted its budget cap transgression as its penalty was unveiled before the Mexico weekend Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images 7. Red Bull has effectively admitted to breaking the 2021 cost cap That Red Bull has accepted the terms of an Accepted Breach Agreement from the FIA in relation to exceeding the 2021 cost cap means the team has effectively held it hands up to the wrongdoing. But its not a straightforward blackandwhite transgression. Red Bull submitted numbers below the budget cap limit  in line with the team declaring its innocence all along  but excluded costs covering 13 areas that ultimately took it over the threshold by close to 2m. The excess is down to failing to include elements such as social security contributions for staff apprenticeship levies cost of use of the power units and a clerical error in the calculation of costs recharged to Red Bull by Red Bull Powertrains among others. The FIA concluded in Mexico that there was no accusation or evidence that Red Bull had sought at any time to act in bad faith dishonestly or in a fraudulent manner nor has it wilfully concealed any information from the Cost Cap Administration. Nevertheless the governing body has punished the 2021 runnerup with a 6m fine and a 10 cut in its aerodynamic testing allocation. It has 30 days to stick its cheque in the post. By way of a reaction team boss Christian Horner called it draconian fiercest rival Toto Wolff reckoned the punishment was about right and praised the FIA while McLarens boss Zak Brown was concerned it wasnt enough of a deterrent to prevent future breaches. Meanwhile Aston Martin will similarly have to cough up close to 390000 for its procedural infringements. The Silverstonebased concerned was found to have inaccurately excluded andor adjusted costs in relation to its shiny new headquarters wind tunnel and simulator. Hamilton intends on extending his Mercedes deal for a few more seasons and still feels great with the team Photo by Zak Mauger  Motorsport Images 8. Hamilton isnt planning on hanging up his helmet any time soon Strictly speaking we learned of Lewis Hamiltons intention to sign a contract extension to remain at Mercedes in an interview conducted in the United States. But that was kept under embargo until the F1 circus unpacked in Mexico so no one could talk about it then. Plus Hamiltons stance had been softening over recent races anyway. Nevertheless with the cat properly out of the bag in Mexico City the seventime champion was bombarded with questions and clarified that there was no immediate end date to his decorated topflight career. He said at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez Im not putting a limit on it to be honest. Im planning to do a multiyear deal with my team. I really really dont know what the next five years hold. I think were still trying to work on that. Theres a lot of great things that are being put in place like Ive just launched a film production company this week. But I feel great like in mind and body. I think theres more stuff to achieve together. I just dont know how long. Fernando Alonso reclaimed his seventh place from Austin after Haas initial protest was rescinded Photo by Zak Mauger  Motorsport Images 9. Alonso did score seventh in the United States GP after all First Fernando Alonso crossed the line to claim seventh place at Austin last time out. Next he was dropped to a pointless 15th after Haas successfully protested his Alpines flapping wing mirror to bring about a belated 30s penalty. Then on Thursday in Mexico the team successfully appealed the decision to leave the FIA to overturn the reprimand. In brief Alpine had rapidly issued a counterprotest for the penalty because Alonso had not been informed by race control that his car was unsafe to continue. It further argued that Haas had handed in its paperwork 24 minutes too late. The FIA ruled this protest to be inadmissible as the rules did not allow a protest to be lodged. Alpine though asked for a right of review on the grounds of bringing new and significant evidence. With the protest therefore admissible another hearing took place on Thursday night in Mexico where it was found that Haas could have lodged a handwritten protest within the 30minute deadline. This therefore meant the initial protest was not admissible making it null and void meaning that Alonso returns to seventh place as a result. Phew. Mexico will remain on the F1 calendar for at least another three seasons Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images 10. F1 will race in Mexico until the middle of the decade Rather than take a leaf out of Spas book  the circuit announced its oneyear extension for 2023 an hour before the Belgian GP which meant the news was totally lost amid the race buildup  the story broke in good time on Thursday that Formula 1 will keep returning to Mexico until 2025 at least. It was revealed that the championship and its owner Liberty Media had inked renewed terms with the Mexico City government and local promoter Corporacion Interamericana de Entretenimiento CIE for a further three years. Last weekends race marked F1s seventh visit to the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriquez of the modern era the venue having returned to the schedule in 2015 following a 22year layoff before the 2020 race was canned by COVID19. CIE president and CEO Alejandro Soberon said The ability to host the race in the nations capital until 2025 is the result of a coordinated effort to preserve an event that brings benefits to the city and excitement to thousands of fans. We will keep working to ensure the race continues to be a strong contributor to our citys economy. We sincerely hopes the deal leads to at least another three years of the mariachi cover of the F1 theme music being used. F1s popularity boom also continues to grow in Mexico Photo by Mark Sutton  Motorsport Images

Notably Red Bull and McLaren are first and second in DHLs ranking of the seasons fastest pit stops in which teams are awarded points on the same basis as the official F1 Championship standings. Red Bull are out in front with 501 points ahead of McLaren on 384 with Ferrari a long way back in third on 227 points.
Russell drove “too cautiously” in first lap F1 battle with Hamilton, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/russell-drove-too-cautiously-in-first-lap-f1-battle-with-hamilton/10393277/, Russell started second but after giving space to Hamilton he emerged from the opening sequence of corners on the first lap in fourth place a position he still held at the end of the race. I knew I wouldnt have been able to overtake Max Verstappen on the outside said Russell when asked by Autosport about his first lap. But having Lewis on the inside I didnt want to be too aggressive obviously him being my teammate. Id like to think it would have been the same had it been the other way around. So the soft should have been a medium the medium should have been the hard and the hard was like an ultra hard effectively., Russell started second but after giving space to Hamilton he emerged from the opening sequence of corners on the first lap in fourth place a position he still held at the end of the race. The Briton admitted that recent frustrations including his first corner collision with Carlos Sainz in Austin encouraged him to take a careful approach especially when battling with his teammate. I knew I wouldnt have been able to overtake Max Verstappen on the outside said Russell when asked by Autosport about his first lap. But having Lewis on the inside I didnt want to be too aggressive obviously him being my teammate. And ultimately that that cost me and caused me to lose two positions. So ultimately if I had managed to maintain position I probably would have finished second today. Asked if he would have given the same space to anyone other than his teammate Russell said Yeah I think it was more in Turn 1 to be honest I would have ordinarily just chopped across or in Turn 2 I would have run the driver wide. So yeah thats the way the game works sometimes. Id like to think it would have been the same had it been the other way around. Maybe maybe not Im not too sure. But Ive had a bit of a scrappy last three races on my behalf too many incidents too many mistakes. And that was probably a factor of taking it too cautiously. And theres a balance in there somewhere. George Russell Mercedes W13 Photo by Mark Sutton  Motorsport Images Russell admitted to some frustration about the strategy he ran in Mexico. Early in the race he indicated that he wanted to run long on his opening set of mediums and then switch to softs a choice used very successfully by Daniel Ricciardo. However not long after that message he mirrored Hamiltons strategy by going to hards. Lots of positives to take away from the weekend he said. It would have also been interesting to see how we performed had we started on the soft and gone to the medium or even if we extended the medium and went to the soft at the end. That was what I was pushing for in the car. Everythings easier in hindsight. Expanding on the strategy choice he said There was no real thought about starting on the soft but there was definitely a thought of extending the medium and going into the soft. Im not too sure I think we reacted to Nicholas Latifi and Lewis they both put the hard on and were setting green sectors everywhere. But the hard tyre just did not work from lap two onwards. I think generally this weekend Pirelli brought too hard a compound. So the soft should have been a medium the medium should have been the hard and the hard was like an ultra hard effectively. So seeing Ricciardos performance is a little bit disappointing as well because I really felt like I could have continued on that medium at a good pace and we would have been flying at the end on that soft. Russell made it clear on the radio that he wasnt happy with the hard tyres but there was nothing that the team could do. In the end he made a late extra stop just to secure fastest lap. I dont think there was so much frustration as such he said. Youre just trying to put your point across and when youre out there its physically demanding and theres a lot going on and youre struggling with the car and it may come across in that way. But I was trying to get my point across. I felt good on the medium. The pace was looking strong before Lewis pitted I was closing the gap. When I was in the lead I was setting personal bests. As I said its so easy in hindsight and perhaps we should have recognised that there was no way I would have been able to overtake Checo with the hard tyre and the only way would have been to put a soft.
Daniel Ricciardo calls for "maturity and respect" from Formula 1 paddock guests, https://www.planetf1.com/news/daniel-ricciardo-paddock-guests-respect/, After a number of drivers complained about the behaviour of some guests in the Mexican Grand Prix paddock Daniel Ricciardo has called for rules for those allowed into the inner circle. Pierre Gasly reported he felt mobbed by fans in the paddock and even had a stranger open his bag. I like having an atmosphere in the paddock I think it should be a fun place to be. Adults need to act like adults.Andreas Seidl warns against overreactionHowever Ricciardos team boss Andreas Seidl has warned against an overreaction. Im sure we will find solutions and we can keep enjoying this new atmosphere we have in the paddock throughout the world., After a number of drivers complained about the behaviour of some guests in the Mexican Grand Prix paddock Daniel Ricciardo has called for rules for those allowed into the inner circle. Formula 1 was racing at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez this past weekend Max Verstappen taking victory in what can only be described as an amphitheatre of excitement. Mexican fans are well known for the atmosphere they create but at times it was a bit too much. Pierre Gasly reported he felt mobbed by fans in the paddock and even had a stranger open his bag. Letting people in is fine but its true I feel like some guests sometimes are not really respecting the space we need he said. And people are coming into garages before qualifying and asking for pictures when they are not even from our team. We are working here and obviously we give time to the fans when we can. I know this weekend I didnt dare come out of the hospitality because otherwise you just know you will get mobbed. Sometimes it gets quite hectic because I arrived at the hospitality with my bag with my passport inside open and I didnt even feel it. Adults need to act like adults Ricciardos solution is for a set of guidelines to be written out and paddock guests to be made aware of the rules inside the paddock. While the Australian enjoys the atmosphere in the paddock he says there should be boundaries. To be honest this year has got more hectic he told The Race. I think there are two sides to it. The paddock used to lack atmosphere. I remember eight years ago 10 years ago the paddock was actually a pretty dull place. I like having an atmosphere in the paddock I think it should be a fun place to be. But there should also be boundaries. I think to be in the paddock and have a VIP pass its a privilege. And I think you also should act with some maturity and have respect. That hasnt always been shown this year. People lose their minds. If they set some guidelines maybe that helps because there isnt that at the moment. If its just a bit of awareness maybe they will be a little more cool. I dont want to see it change. Adults need to act like adults. Andreas Seidl warns against overreaction However Ricciardos team boss Andreas Seidl has warned against an overreaction. Formula 1 has often in the past been criticised for being out of reach for the fans the sport keeping its distance from the masses. Today under Liberty Media it is more accessible the owners trying to engage with fans wherever possible. The direction Formula 1 took is definitely the right one and a good one said the McLaren team principal. I appreciate a lot the atmosphere that is around now in the paddocks throughout the season. Here its clearly too extreme. And I think we just need to follow up and have a good discussion with Formula 1 how we can make sure that especially in countries like here in Mexico where the fans are also passionate for what we are doing and so enthusiastic we just always keep the right level of respect. Im sure we will find solutions and we can keep enjoying this new atmosphere we have in the paddock throughout the world.
Daniel Ricciardo “talking to teams” over F1 stay - George Russell opens door to Mercedes role | F1 | News, https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1016111/1/daniel-ricciardo-future-update-door-open-mercedes-role, The McLaren driver enjoyed a rare positive outing in 2022 at the F1 Mexico City Grand Prix finishing in P7 but has just two races remaining with his future unclear. Ricciardos contract with McLaren will be terminated a year early and he wont be in the F1 2023 driver lineup but has been linked to a reserve driver role at Mercedes.

Ricciardos contract with McLaren will be terminated a year early and he wont be in the F1 2023 driver lineup but has been linked to a reserve driver role at Mercedes. Daniel Ricciardo  WHERE NEXT  F1 2022 Video of Daniel Ricciardo  WHERE NEXT  F1 2022 Yeah it would be interesting Russell said to Sky about Ricciardo joining. Id like to see that. We have to see what he wants to do in the future. Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff had been spotted wearing Ricciardos merchandise but denied that it hinting towards a linkup. I am promoting his merch Honestly I just like it Wolff said. They took a photo of me and posted it online. Ricciardo teased I gave George a sweater. Toto messaged saying he really liked it so I gave him one too Vacant seats with Alpine Haas and Williams have passed without Ricciardo signing up. He said about his limited options If there was a lot Id probably be in a race seat. But there is enough to keep me interested. I want to stay active to some degree. Im aware that doing nothing for a year is not good. Ricciardo claimed I honestly dont know which team he will join in 2023 but the plan was to remain in F1 albeit not in a race seat. I am talking to teams he said. I still want to keep a foot in the door for 2024. Seeing the lights go out for race one I will have an itch Ricciardo sits 12th in the F1 standings after being comprehensively outperformed by teammate Lando Norris all year. He will be replaced by rookie Oscar Piastri next season. The last two years have been quite hard he admitted. You put a lot in and when it doesnt come back it can get you down. I know the value of a summer break. Stepping away can give you a different perspective. The season is pretty relentless you dont get a chance to rebuild. I truly believe it will be a blessing in disguise. I can confidently say that I wont be on the grid behind a wheel. But I still want to be in the sport working with a team. Still with the ambition to be back on the grid in 2024. Thats where my head is at. Time away from a race seat will do me good. Im not done. But it will look different.
'I felt fast but once again Car 14 stops' – Alonso frustrated after fifth DNF of the season in Mexico | Formula 1�, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.i-felt-fast-but-once-again-car-14-stops-alonso-frustrated-after-fifth-dnf-of.5DJ8dYBebtwT5Q05yxzDGg.html, Having seen strong points slip away on each occasion the Spaniard was left frustrated at the recurring reliability issues. Car 14 stops before the chequered flag so I think now we lost about 70 points Alonso said. Alonso frustrated after another failure I felt fast today but once again car 14 stopsWe are still happy with our strategy of pushing hard and having a car that performs. He did well to bring the car home in eighth place and score some valuable points for the team. Im confident we can rectify these issues going into the final two races of the season., The sight of Fernando Alonso punching the air in frustration alongside his stricken car is one that will stick out from the race in Mexico as his time with Alpine nears its end. Alonso was running a competitive seventh when he started to suffer from a loss of power and eventually had to retire his car at Turn 1 inside the final 10 laps to register his third retirement in five races. Having seen strong points slip away on each occasion the Spaniard was left frustrated at the recurring reliability issues. Car 14 stops before the chequered flag so I think now we lost about 70 points Alonso said. But its pointless to talk about this once more so lets see. Only two races to go and then a new chapter. MONDAY MORNING DEBRIEF How cunning strategy allowed us to see Ricciardo back at his best in Mexico I think Austin and Mexico have been the best races from a personal point of view. Pacewise I was like 20 seconds or something like that ahead of the McLarens and my team mate. I felt fast but once again Car 14 stops. Alonso was running in seventh before he stopped on track with an issue Team mate Ocon did gain a position as a result of Alonsos misfortune but then was unable to keep Daniel Ricciardo at bay late on. With a 10second time penalty hanging over the McLaren driver Ricciardo was able to pull enough of a gap to retain seventh place after his punishment was handed out leaving Ocon in eighth. I think we didnt put everything together but we fought hard the whole way Ocon said. Damage limitation I would call it. Obviously we lost Fernando we were supposed to have a doublepoints finish. READ MORE Verstappen makes F1 history as he beats Hamilton to victory in Mexico for 14th win of the season I was managing the cooling issue we were having a lot and thats mainly why we lost to Daniel. Happy for him on one side but not happy on the other side because we lost out as a team. So damage limitation well keep fighting in the last two rounds. Reliability has arguably been Alpines biggest weakness this season but Ocon is comfortable with the tradeoff of chasing performance first and foremost. Alonso frustrated after another failure I felt fast today but once again car 14 stops We are still happy with our strategy of pushing hard and having a car that performs. The pace was good when we didnt have to manage so much so it was solid in that regard. Its a stance echoed by Team Principal Otmar Szafnauer who was unhappy at losing Alonso late on but believes Alpine can find fixes for their problems ahead of the penultimate round in Brazil. FACTS AND STATS Verstappen sets new season records for points and wins Unfortunately Fernando suffered a cylinder failure on Lap 52 and he was having to manage on five cylinders  meaning a significant lack of power  to try and remain inside the points Szafnauer said. Eventually the problem was not sustainable and he had to retire the car. Esteban faced a challenge with some cooling issues from quite early on in the race where he had to liftandcoast and therefore he sacrificed significant lap time. He did well to bring the car home in eighth place and score some valuable points for the team. We know reliability is going to be the key in our championship battle and its something that has let us down after showing such a strong level of performance in recent races. Im confident we can rectify these issues going into the final two races of the season.
Alonso feels Alpine is "unprepared" after Mexico F1 reliability woes, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/alonso-feels-alpine-is-unprepared-after-latest-reliability-woe-in-mexico/10393322/, Speaking in the media pen after the race Alonso noted that for car 14 there are always reliability issues referring to his Alpine and said he thought his race had been exceptional up to that point. Fernando Alonso Alpine F1 Team Photo by Zak Mauger  Motorsport ImagesHe added The engine cannot finish the races. The retirement in Mexico marked the fifth time this season Alonso has failed to see the chequered flag. The Spaniard sits 11 points behind Alpine teammate Esteban Ocon in the standings after the Frenchman finished eighth in Mexico. Alonso has just two races remaining with Alpine in F1 before he makes the switch to Aston Martin for the 2023 season., Alonso had been in contention for a points finish at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez only to suffer a cylinder failure while running seventh before an eventual loss of power forced him to retire from the race with six laps remaining. It came as the latest reliability setback for Alonso in what has been a frustrating season that has seen him regularly lament points lost through no fault of his own claiming to have lost more than 60 points over the season. Speaking in the media pen after the race Alonso noted that for car 14 there are always reliability issues referring to his Alpine and said he thought his race had been exceptional up to that point. Its just amazing that only one or two cars retire at every race and there is always car 14 said Alonso. I blew up five engines this year I think. The problem in the qualifying in Australia in Austria I didnt even start the race because of the blackout. So I think in 19 races more or less 50 of the races we havent scored the points we deserve. But theres nothing we can do now. Asked if he thought it was simply a case of bad luck for him Alonso replied No I think we are unprepared. Fernando Alonso Alpine F1 Team Photo by Zak Mauger  Motorsport Images He added The engine cannot finish the races. It cannot be bad luck when you have to change six or seven engines as we did and still not finishing races. I think they have some job to do over the winter hopefully not too much. Renault placed a big emphasis on gaining more performance with the engine for its works F1 team over the winter having long lagged behind rivals Mercedes Ferrari and Honda. While the French manufacturer has made big gains on that front this year it has also suffered more reliability issues  something Alpine technical chief Pat Fry said was a result of a courageous development push. The retirement in Mexico marked the fifth time this season Alonso has failed to see the chequered flag. The Spaniard sits 11 points behind Alpine teammate Esteban Ocon in the standings after the Frenchman finished eighth in Mexico. My level is very high at this point of the season and the standings at the end of the year will be one of the lowest Alonso said. Its a little bit frustrating but theres nothing I can do. Alonso has just two races remaining with Alpine in F1 before he makes the switch to Aston Martin for the 2023 season.
Ricciardo "didn't plan" to overtake Tsunoda ahead of Mexico F1 clash, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/ricciardo-didnt-plan-to-overtake-tsunoda-ahead-of-mexico-f1-clash/10393312/, Tsunoda driver made it back to the pits but he was forced to retire due to damage incurred. Ricciardo said he wouldnt take full blame for the earlier incident suggesting that Tsunoda could have left him more room. I didnt lock I stayed on the apex truth is I didnt actually plan or want to overtake him there. I mean of course Id love to overtake him I wasnt set into that corner to like outbrake him and overtake him. At that point I didnt really care he said., Listen to this article The pair made contact when Ricciardo made a move on the inside of a tight righthander as they battled for 11th position on the 51st lap. Tsunoda driver made it back to the pits but he was forced to retire due to damage incurred. Ricciardo was soon handed a 10second penalty by the FIA stewards. However his recovery was helped by him being one of the few drivers to switch to soft tyres for the last part of the race. Against the odds he moved up to seventh place by the flag and was far enough ahead of Esteban Ocon that the effect of the penalty was negated. Ricciardo said he wouldnt take full blame for the earlier incident suggesting that Tsunoda could have left him more room. Ive seen a few replays he said. I mean Ill take more of the responsibility but certainly I dont feel it was 100 to zero in terms of my fault. I didnt lock I stayed on the apex truth is I didnt actually plan or want to overtake him there. I mean of course Id love to overtake him I wasnt set into that corner to like outbrake him and overtake him. I just thought if I stay there Its nothing that you probably dont know but all the grips on the inside of that corner. Its very dusty. So I thought if I could just stay there keep him a bit on the dirty line Ill get a better exit. Look we probably needed to give each other 2030 more centimetres and were fine. Probably not even that. I wish it didnt happen and Im sorry that it happened but I think 10 seconds was more than enough and somehow we kind of still came through. Ricciardo admitted that he expected a penalty. Yeah I figured they probably had to do something. But I also its so hard when youre in the heat of battle but I didnt remember locking. With Carlos Sainz in Imola Turn 1 when I went off the apex and slid into him. It didnt feel like that. So I was going to come on the radio and vent a little but I just chose to say nothing. I went pretty dark and then just decided to keep pushing and try to make up for it. Ricciardo said he felt really comfortable once he was on the soft tyre. At that point I didnt really care he said. Because I didnt have that much to lose and as soon as I got out the pits the tyre was like so much better. I could lean on it and I felt like I was in control. So I was like lets just use this tyre see what its got. And then it stayed relatively consistent. So I kind of pushed really hard then just tried to manage it and it was still giving me a lot more pace. Ricciardo also revealed that George Russell might have cost him a position by dropping him within 10 seconds on the pursuing Ocon but a late pit stop by the Mercedes driver saved him. The last few laps I was pretty nervous because George was so close to getting a blue flag for me. And I knew I would lose a couple of seconds with that. And that would have dropped me back into Ocon. So I was pushing like hell just to try and hold that twosecond gap. And then when I heard he pitted for fastest lap  he probably doesnt think it or know it but Ill buy him a beer anyways
Record-breaking Max Verstappen already an F1 great at 25, https://www.espn.com/f1/story/_/id/34916572/record-breaking-max-verstappen-already-f1-great-25, For the now double world champion Max Verstappen his first season of total dominance has come at the relatively young age of 25. With two races remaining in 2022 there is every chance Verstappen raises the bar to 16. More impressively he has won races from lowly grid positions which was rarely the case for the other Vettel and Schumacher. Vettel won all of his 13 races in 2013 from the front row of the grid while Schumacher won 11 of his 13 from the first two grid positions. Like him or not Verstappens performance this year has been truly exceptional., MEXICO CITY  Dominance by a single driver is common in Formula One but that doesnt mean its easy to attain. Many of the greats have enjoyed a season  or multiple seasons  of unbeatable form but the ease with which the victories fall always belies the hard work with which they were achieved. For the now double world champion Max Verstappen his first season of total dominance has come at the relatively young age of 25. By winning the Mexican Grand Prix on Sunday his 14th of the year Verstappen set a new record for race victories in a single season. The previous record of 13 was set in 2004 by Michael Schumacher during his dominant Ferrari years and equaled in 2013 by Sebastian Vettel while driving for Red Bull. With two races remaining in 2022 there is every chance Verstappen raises the bar to 16. Not that the man himself is interested in the numbers. I was never really interested in stats Verstappen said after securing his victory in Mexico. I just live in the moment try to do the best I can every single weekend. I try to win the races  that for me is the most important thing that when I go home I can say to myself that I maximized the performance and if Im close to that Im happy. But a lot in Formula One depends on the whole package and we have a great package right now. Im just enjoying the moment and Im not that interested in keeping in touch with every stat. But of course it has been an amazing season and of course I am very happy winning so many races. Max Verstappen has been almost unbeatable in 2022. Chris GraythenGetty Images As Verstappen has pointed out before comparing records across eras in Formula One is fraught with inconsistencies. Schumacher achieved his 13 wins in an 18race season Vettel scored his in a 19race season and Verstappen secured his first 13 wins of 2022 in 20 race period before taking No. 14 at the 21st race of the year. But while Verstappens season may be statistically less impressive with two races left to run he has arguably had a less dominant car than Schumacher and Vettel enjoyed in their record years. Whats more he has secured a number of his 14 wins in a more spectacular fashion. While the Red Bull is clearly the class of the field at this stage of the season Ferrari was a genuine threat for victories at every race in the early rounds of 2022. Looking at it one way you could argue the Italian team has gifted Verstappen additional wins  most notably in Spain when Charles Leclerc broke down and then in France when Leclerc crashed out of the lead  but the counter argument is that Verstappen has consistently been in a position to take advantage. More impressively he has won races from lowly grid positions which was rarely the case for the other Vettel and Schumacher. Vettel won all of his 13 races in 2013 from the front row of the grid while Schumacher won 11 of his 13 from the first two grid positions. Verstappen however has won six of his 14 from grid positions outside the top two and two of those were from way back in 10th and 14th on the grid in Hungary and Belgium. At a glance that could reflect negatively on his qualifying performance but his three lowliest grid positions that led to victories were all at races where he had either grid penalties for engine component changes Italy and Belgium or a power unit issue in qualifying Hungary. On top of that Ferrari has had a quicker car in qualifying at a number of races this year which was not the case among Vettels and Schumachers rivals when they were dominating. It means Verstappen has had to fight harder for the front row starting positions he has earned and to underline that point a surprising statistic from this year is that Leclerc has a higher average starting position 2.65 than Verstappens 2.70 while also securing nine poles to Verstappens seven. Again the comparison between eras is far from perfect but there is no doubt Verstappen has already put himself among the sports greatest drivers with many fruitful years of his career still to run. His team boss Christian Horner who is in a position to directly compare the newlycrowned twotime champion with fourtime champion Vettel gave a valid perspective on the two on Sunday night. They are two very different drivers two phenomenally successful drivers and I think what Sebastian has achieved in his career puts him among the greats and the most successful drivers in the sport he said on Sunday evening in Mexico. But I think Max what we are seeing today and this year we are actually witnessing something very special. I sometimes think that his achievements perhaps dont receive the plaudits that they should because what we have witnessed this year is an absolutely outstanding performance from a driver who is at the top of his game. Asked if Verstappens was the most impressive seasonlong performance from a driver Horner has seen he added Theres been years of domination with Mercedes but I think as an individual driver probably yes. He has won the most grands prix in a year now within 21 races. On top of that he has won two sprint races and he has not won all of them from pole position. Hes had to fight and race for a lot of those victories. When we look back at the end of the year it is an absolutely outstanding year that Max has driven. He hasnt put a wheel wrong. He has been perfect throughout the season and its incredible the level of consistency he has been able to achieve. Of course thats the opinion of a very proud team boss with a naturally biased viewpoint but even if Verstappen retired tomorrow it would be hard to deny his position among the top drivers in F1 history after this years performance. There will be some that point to Red Bulls breach of last years cost cap as a reason to diminish Verstappens achievement in 2022. But even the most exaggerated claims of how much performance Red Bull gained in the development of this years car by overspending last year would fall short of cancelling out his advantage over the rest of the field. Like him or not Verstappens performance this year has been truly exceptional.

Gasly wants talks with stewards after nearing F1 race ban in Mexico GP, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/gasly-close-to-one-race-f1-ban-after-reaching-10-penalty-points/10393267/, Gasly has become increasingly frustrated with officialdom in recent weeks having been penalised for speeding under the red flag at the Japanese GP and for leaving too big a gap behind the safety car in Austin. He raised the matter of the harshness of the penalty points system in Fridays drivers briefing prior to the Mexican GP. Last weekend half the grid was giving too much space behind the safety car and I was penalised. At the end of the day I try my best inside the car and the last thing I want is to get stupid penalty points and lose race time. It was not just the penalty points because obviously Im quite close to being banned for a race he said when asked by Autosport about the briefing debate., The point took his running 12month total up to 10 just two short of the figure that automatically triggers a suspension for one event. His first points were logged in the Spanish GP on 22 May  which means under the current rules he wont lose any from his total until after next years Emilia Romagna GP the seventh round of the 2023 championship. Gasly has become increasingly frustrated with officialdom in recent weeks having been penalised for speeding under the red flag at the Japanese GP and for leaving too big a gap behind the safety car in Austin. He raised the matter of the harshness of the penalty points system in Fridays drivers briefing prior to the Mexican GP. He subsequently picked up a further point in Sundays race after being deemed to have left the track and gained an advantage when battling with Lance Stroll. He received a fivesecond penalty as well as the point. Gasly was clearly frustrated after the Mexican race having fallen foul of the FIA yet again and after learning about the penalty point he even took a moment to gather his thoughts before speaking to the media. He was particularly frustrated that he wasnt told to give the position back to Stroll. Im a racing driver and if I see a gap I will go for the gap he said when asked about the Stroll incident by Autosport. And if you are not happy about it tell me to give the position back and then I will try again. I wasnt given any comments so that is a shame. He added They just need to say it on the radio and that is what they have done in the past but for some reason not this time. Pierre Gasly AlphaTauri AT03 Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images Asked if he had to change his approach Gasly said he will speak to officials at the next race in Brazil. They the stewards seem to be quite harsh lately he said. Last weekend half the grid was giving too much space behind the safety car and I was penalised. This weekend I think it was quite tight and I dont know why I wasnt really given a message to give the position back. At the end of the day I try my best inside the car and the last thing I want is to get stupid penalty points and lose race time. Apparently at the moment they are not happy with what Im doing so I will have a discussion to understand exactly what I have got to change. Earlier in the weekend Gasly indicated that the discussion he initiated in Fridays drivers briefing discussion about penalties had been a positive one even suggesting that the points system may be adjusted by the FIA  possibly in time to save him from a race ban in 2023. It was not just the penalty points because obviously Im quite close to being banned for a race he said when asked by Autosport about the briefing debate. But in my opinion I dont feel like Ive been that dangerous over the last 12 months and it would be a shame to get a race ban for slowing down a bit too much behind the safety car and a couple of track limits this year. So I think theyre working on it and probably for next year there are going to be changes. Thats good to hear. Gaslys 2022 penalty points Spain Causing a collision Lance Stroll  2 points Austria Causing a collision Sebastian Vettel  2 points Austria Leaving the track without justification multiple times  1 point Japan Speeding under red flag conditions  2 points USA Car fell more than 10 lengths behind the safety car  2 points Mexico Leaving the track and gaining an advantage Lance Stroll  1 point On 10 October Gasly lost two penalty points earned for causing a collision with Fernando Alonso at the 2021 Turkish GP. This year he also received two reprimands for bollard offences in Canada.
Red Bull boycott Sky Sports after reporter said Lewis Hamilton was 'robbed' of F1 title, https://inews.co.uk/sport/formula-one/red-bull-boycotts-sky-sports-ted-kravitz-lewis-hamilton-robbed-f1-title-1943825, Max Verstappen accused Sky Sports of being disrespectful and living in the past after Red Bull boycotted the broadcaster at the Mexican Grand Prix. Verstappen and his entire Red Bull team  including Christian Horner  refused to address Sky on Sunday. Their unprecedented stance came a week after Sky Sports pitlane reporter Ted Kravitz said Lewis Hamilton was last year robbed of an eighth world championship. It is understood Red Bull have grown increasingly frustrated with Skys coverage since the contentious Abu Dhabi finale. Initially Red Bull said the boycott would be indefinite but Horner indicated on Sunday night that their silence would end at the following round in Brazil on 13 November., Max Verstappen accused Sky Sports of being disrespectful and living in the past after Red Bull boycotted the broadcaster at the Mexican Grand Prix. Verstappen and his entire Red Bull team  including Christian Horner  refused to address Sky on Sunday. Their unprecedented stance came a week after Sky Sports pitlane reporter Ted Kravitz said Lewis Hamilton was last year robbed of an eighth world championship. It is understood Red Bull have grown increasingly frustrated with Skys coverage since the contentious Abu Dhabi finale. Sky Sports declined to comment. Confronting the subject after he won for a recordbreaking 14th time in one season on Sunday Verstappen said It had nothing to do with this weekend but this year. It has been a constant kind of digging and being disrespectful especially from one particular person. At one point it is enough and I dont accept it. You cannot live in the past and you have to move on. Social media is a very toxic place and if you are constantly being like that live on TV then you are making it worse instead of trying to make it better. You keep disrespecting me and at one point I will not tolerate it any more and that is why I decided to stop answering. Hamilton finished runnerup to Verstappen at last weekends United States Grand Prix in Austin after he was passed by the Red Bull driver with six laps remaining. Following the race Kravitz said Hamilton doesnt win a race all year and then finally comes back at a track where he could win the first race battling the same guy who won the race he was robbed in the previous year and manages to finish ahead of him. What a script and a story that would have been. But thats not the way the script turned out today was it Because the guy that beat him after being robbed actually overtook him because hes got a quicker car because of engineering and Formula One and design and pretty much because of Adrian Newey Red Bull technical chief over there. Verstappen claimed his maiden world championship after race director Michael Masi incorrectly applied the safety car rules in the closing laps of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Although Masi was removed from his position an FIA investigation said the Australian acted in good faith but made a human error. Initially Red Bull said the boycott would be indefinite but Horner indicated on Sunday night that their silence would end at the following round in Brazil on 13 November. There were some derogatory comments made so we took a break from Sky for this race he said. Max was upset. We were upset and we made the decision to stand together as a team. It wont have done Sky any harm for us to lay down a marker. Some of the commentary is fair but some pieces are sensationalist and saying we robbed anyone of the championship as was said in Austin is going too far. It is not impartial or fair or balanced. We have said our piece and will go back to normal next time. Earlier this month F1 bosses signed off a new deal with Sky which will mean the broadcaster retains exclusive UK television rights until the end of the 2029 season. Press Association

Mercedes unsure Ricciardo's F1 strategy would have changed Mexican GP result, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/mercedes-unsure-ricciardos-f1-strategy-would-have-changed-mexico-result/10393217/, Verstappen scored his 14th win of the season for Red Bull but was kept honest by Lewis Hamilton through the opening stint as Mercedes opted for a different starting tyre. While Red Bull fitted softs to both Verstappen and Sergio Perezs cars from the start Mercedes went for mediums with Hamilton and George Russell favouring a onestop strategy. Hamilton kept within two seconds of Verstappen through the opening stint before taking the lead when the Red Bull pitted stretching out his mediums to last 29 laps. Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff said after the race it was always easier to judge with hindsight but explained that the teams prerace data suggested it had gone for the right strategy. We experimented with a lot of things the engine guys have pushed the boundaries really to give us the maximum performance also., Verstappen scored his 14th win of the season for Red Bull but was kept honest by Lewis Hamilton through the opening stint as Mercedes opted for a different starting tyre. While Red Bull fitted softs to both Verstappen and Sergio Perezs cars from the start Mercedes went for mediums with Hamilton and George Russell favouring a onestop strategy. Hamilton kept within two seconds of Verstappen through the opening stint before taking the lead when the Red Bull pitted stretching out his mediums to last 29 laps. But when Hamilton switched to hard tyres the seventime world champion said he was not feeling as comfortable allowing Verstappen to extend his lead and ultimately avoid a second pitstop en route to victory ahead of the Mercedes. Russell asked Mercedes at one point during the race to go for softs in the final stint only to be told it would have required a long mediumtyre stint. That approach was successfully taken by Ricciardo and McLaren who pitted on lap 44 to switch from mediums to softs before going on a late charge that led him to seventh even after a 10second penalty was applied for a clash with Yuki Tsunoda. Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff said after the race it was always easier to judge with hindsight but explained that the teams prerace data suggested it had gone for the right strategy. I think the onestop mediumhard looked like the right strategy said Wolff. That the medium held on for so long at the end came as a surprise. But hindsight is the thing. If we were to restart the race maybe we would choose a different tyre. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes W13 Sergio Perez Red Bull Racing RB18 Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images Wolff said Mercedes could have decided to lose more time on the medium and hang it out there for another five or six laps and then try to do 30 laps on the soft like Ricciardo did but he felt it was not a given that it would hold on to the end of the race. Both Hamilton and Russells race engineers were heard during the race telling their drivers that the Red Bulls mediums were expected to drop off in pace only for them to last longer than expected and for them to finish behind Verstappen and Perez. Wolff said Mercedes had discussed using on softs in the race and felt the tyre was strong but not strong enough to go 30 laps or so. Asked by Autosport if he thought the mediumsoft strategy would have been enough to beat Red Bull today Wolff replied I dont think we could have overtaken them because with the gaps that would have been basically the reverse strategy. Even the softmedium that would have been a bit of an advantage into Turn 1. Lewis was on the outside so you never know how it would have come. But we would have been even closer on a different strategy. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes W13 in the pits Photo by Steven Tee  Motorsport Images Mercedes comfortably ran as the secondfastest team ahead of Ferrari in Mexico aided by the high altitude that meant it did not struggle with drag as much as at other tracks as well as benefitting from its high downforce strength. The team now has just two more chances to end its winless campaign but Wolff said the simulations suggested Mexico had been its best chance. On the simulations it says yes he said. But we see the tendency we see that we are able to compete. Im really proud of the team of what we did this weekend. We experimented with a lot of things the engine guys have pushed the boundaries really to give us the maximum performance also. I think it will be a mix between trying the max while trying the most for next year.
Alonso set for maiden Aston Martin F1 test in Abu Dhabi, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/alonso-maiden-aston-martin-test-abu-dhabi/10393193/, Listen to this articleThe test to be held on the Tuesday following the final race of the season will feature two cars per team. Race drivers will run the definitive 2023 Pirelli tyres in one car and rookies will drive the other. Traditionally the Abu Dhabi running sees drivers who are moving teams for the following year gain their first experience with their new outfits assuming that they have been able to negotiate a release from their previous teams. Meanwhile Felipe Drugovich is due to drive last years Aston Martin AMR21 on the full Silverstone circuit on Tuesday the same car having recently been used by Zak OSullivan for his Aston Martin Autosport BRDC Young Driver of the Year Award run.

Race drivers will run the definitive 2023 Pirelli tyres in one car and rookies will drive the other. Traditionally the Abu Dhabi running sees drivers who are moving teams for the following year gain their first experience with their new outfits assuming that they have been able to negotiate a release from their previous teams. Often part of the arrangement is that they appear in neutral or unbranded overalls. AlphaTauri boss Franz Tost revealed in Mexico on Friday that Nyck de Vries will drive for his team while Pierre Gasly is expected to make is first appearance for Alpine as part of the bigger deal that released him from the Red Bull camp for 2023. However Oscar Piastri has not yet been released by Alpine to drive for McLaren. The Enstone teams boss Otmar Szafnauer noted in Mexico I think our legal teams are discussing that now. And I dont know. Therell be more next week so ask me in Brazil. Its understood that Alonso had to gain permission himself for his release from Alpine with no direct involvement from Aston Martin and that he has been able to do so. Asked by Motorsport.com if he had cards in his hand that helped him to gain that release Alonso smiled and said Im always in charge of my own destiny Sebastian Vettel Aston Martin AMR22 Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images Alonso is expected to run half a day of tyre testing in Abu Dhabi with his new teammate Lance Stroll doing the other half. The Spaniard will be able to log further mileage with the AMR22 in Pirelli tyre testing in February prior to the launch of the new car and the sole official test session in Bahrain a week prior to the first race of the season. Meanwhile Felipe Drugovich is due to drive last years Aston Martin AMR21 on the full Silverstone circuit on Tuesday the same car having recently been used by Zak OSullivan for his Aston Martin Autosport BRDC Young Driver of the Year Award run. As well as being the first big step in Drugovichs development programme with the team it will be an important day for the Brazilian as he will have to complete 300kms in order to qualify to take part in FP1 at the Abu Dhabi GP. If he fails to do so for any reason the team will have to find someone else to do the FP1 session with De Vries the obvious candidate. Drugovich will however still be able to do the young driver test that follows the race weekend Aston Martin Ambassador Jess Hawkins is also scheduled to do some laps in the AMR21 on Tuesday after Drugovich has run. In other rookie driver news Liam Lawson is expected to replace Max Verstappen at Red Bull in FP1 in Abu Dhabi the Kiwi having already done two sessions for AlphaTauri.

In part he blames UK broadcaster Sky Sports pitlane reporter Ted Kravitz for a series of comments made live on television.

Max Verstappen broke all time records on Sunday whilst admitting that he is boycotting the Formula 1 broadcaster Sky. We are definitely enjoying it and well try to go for more said the backtoback world champion after breaking Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettels alltime record for the number of wins now 14 in a single season. In Mexico he also raced past Lewis Hamiltons record now 416 for the number of points scored in a season. But while the Dutchman and Red Bull are enjoying unprecedented success Verstappen says the environment on social media has become toxic. In part he blames UK broadcaster Sky Sports pitlane reporter Ted Kravitz for a series of comments made live on television. Kravitz said Verstappen 25 doesnt seem to be a driver capable of winning a championship in a normal way and says Hamilton  who he has called an eight time champion  was robbed of the 2021 title. He Verstappen has got a quicker car because of engineering and Formula 1 and design and pretty much because of him Adrian Newey over there Kravitz also said. As the course of the Mexican GP weekend progressed it became clear not only that Verstappen was refusing to talk to Sky UK Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland but that Red Bull as a whole team was following suit. Verstappen confirmed the boycott. This year its been a constant kind of like digging being disrespectful especially one particular person he said. And at one point its enough you know I dont accept it. At the moment social media is a very toxic place. And if you are constantly being like that live on TV you make it only worse instead of trying to make it better in the world. You keep disrespecting me and one point Im not tolerating it anymore. Thats why I decided to stop answering Verstappen added. His boss Christian Horner backed his driver and confirmed that Red Bull had also boycotted the Sky broadcasters over the Mexican GP weekend. Were disappointed with a series of derogatory comments that have been made on Sky so we felt this weekend we would take a break he said. There needs to be balance in commentary. Some of the commentary is excellent but some of the pieces there is too much sensationalism being done. Max was very upset about it and as a team we support him fully.
FIA post-race press conference - Mexico City, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.fia-post-race-press-conference-mexico-city-2022.7jLyhzROnX4I8Tmn6n1odT.html, I was so close I think in that first stint but I think the Red Bull was just clearly too fast today and ultimately maybe they had the better tyre strategy. I really really pushed hard. MV Yeah I mean another great race I think. So yeah another great race but also its just an incredible season for us as a team. So ultimately I think they were on the right tyre strategy., DRIVERS 1  Max VERSTAPPEN Red Bull Racing 2  Lewis HAMILTON Mercedes 3  Sergio PREZ Red Bull Racing PARC FERM INTERVIEWS Conducted by Marc Gen Q Hello everybody. Hola todos. Max Verstappen you are unstoppable. Tell me first on the race which was the key point because everybody spoke about the start. And you did great. You know do you think that was a very important key to win that race Max VERSTAPPEN Yeah of course that helped me out a lot for the rest of the race to stay in the lead after Turn 1. Of course we were also on a different strategy to the cars around us. But yeah again an incredible result. The pace of the car was again really nice. We had to look after our tyres because it was a very long stint on the medium but we made it work. Q Youve been to many many podiums but have you ever seen something like that with such a big crowd MV Its amazing. Its an incredible atmosphere and we love to come here. Q And finally Max. I dont know how much you look into numbers or how much you are into history. World Champion and now you are the first driver ever to win 14 grands prix in one season. How do you feel about that MV Yeah its been an incredible year so far. So yeah we are definitely enjoying it and well try to go for more. Q Well done. Enjoy. Lewis Hamilton second place. You were pushing all the way. You were pushing Max at the beginning of the race. Did you think at some point that you could win the race Lewis HAMILTON Yeah well first this has been an amazing crowd and definitely a bit awkward this time rounds boos all day but nonetheless I have so much love for Mexico and for the people here and what a great race and event they have put on this weekend. I was so close I think in that first stint but I think the Red Bull was just clearly too fast today and ultimately maybe they had the better tyre strategy. Q About the tyres and the strategy you tried the Hard compound we could hear you on the radio that it was difficult. What was the problem Do you think the Hard was not the right tyre at that moment of the race LH Yeah not sure it was the right tyre the end. I thought we should have started on the Soft but obviously we had the opposite tyre. It was OK in the first stint but that Hard was just offset so congratulations to Max and its great to be up here and separate the two. Q Still well done you kept the pressure on Checo so well done for that second place. And now Checo. Well done. What do you feel What are your emotions What are your emotions to be in front of 70000 Mexicans here in the Foro Sol Sergio PREZ Yeah I mean I gave my best you know today at the start. I really really pushed hard. Unfortunately we had a little bit of a bad stop which prevented us to undercut Lewis. Overtaking is so difficult. As soon as I got behind him it was really difficult to follow so I had to stay in third. Q But still I think a key point was the start when you overtook Russell to be on the podium. Do you think that was very important in Turn 4 SP Yeah definitely. You know given how difficult overtaking was today I think that it was key you know. I thought we were going to be a little closer but unfortunately it didnt work out for us today but still its good a good podium in front of this crowd. I really wanted more today but third place its still a good. PRESS CONFERENCE Q Well done Max that was a brilliantly controlled race and one that sees you take the record of 14 wins in a season. Another incredible milestone in an extraordinary season. MV Yeah I mean another great race I think. We knew that the first stint was going to be the crucial one for us to keep that Soft tyre alive long enough which seemed to work. I mean I did struggle a bit towards the end but luckily the gap was big enough to extend a few laps. And yeah once we put on the Medium tyres everything was working quite well. And I think quite early on we figured that we could make it to the end. So yeah another great race but also its just an incredible season for us as a team. Never thought I would be able to win 14 races in a year. But yeah of course Im incredibly proud. Q Can I throw another stat at you With 416 points youve also broken the record for the number of points scored in a single season. How high can you go MV I mean we have a sprint race in Brazil and laughs Hopefully we can score a few more but I mean its not about that. At the end of the day its all about trying to win a championship and it doesnt matter with how many points you do it but it does show that we are having an incredible year. Q Can we talk a little bit more about strategy Did you consider the Hard tyre at that pit stop MV No. I tried it in FP1 and it just didnt really feel great. So I think thats why we never really wanted to use it. Q You seemed to be managing a fair bit during the race not just looking after the tyres. We heard you talking about bouncing. We also heard you comment on the gearshifts. Just how many issues were there MV No no real issues. Its just that the kerbs here are quite aggressive and I was trying a few different lines and some worked and some didnt. And with the gears I think it was just after the pit stop I think the clutch was a bit warm. And after that it was OK. Q A final word on the podium. We can hear the music in the background now just how special is it here in the Foro Sol MV Yeah I mean they put on a great show. I mean the atmosphere in general is incredible. The fans are super passionate about Formula 1 but of course about Checo. But it also helps a lot You know you have that whole stadium and it makes it look incredible. Its a great atmosphere. Q Max many thanks and many congratulations as well. Lewis were coming to you now. Great job. Your second second place in as many weeks although you didnt seem totally happy with your strategy after the race. What would you change if you ran the race again LH Well firstly Im really happy to be up here and to be able to split the Red Bulls I think is a huge result for us. Brought an upgrade into the last race and to have kindof close the gap a little bit  they still have the edge I think  but I dont know I think it was amazing for us to be fighting in qualifying and have the second and third. I was speaking about in strategy about us taking a risk with one of the cars at least doing something different. I had a gut feeling that they will be on the Soft to start with and when everyone took their blankets off everyone around us was on the Softs and were on the Mediums. At that moment. I thought that we may be in trouble. But then again its a long long race so I thought maybe theyll be on a twostop. But that Medium tyre just had no dropoff. So ultimately I think they were on the right tyre strategy. But I am grateful I was able to just about keep up within that first stint. Thats huge to be able to keep up with a Red Bull. Q You said during the race that you werent happy with the Hard tyre. Did you consider going longer on the Medium and then going straight to Soft LH I mean I kept telling them the tyre was fine but Im assuming that they were coming into my window. Sergio had already stopped. So Im assuming they they were going much quicker than me perhaps. So if we stayed out longer I would have come out behind Sergio and it would have been all over. So I think thats the reason. Unfortunately at the beginning obviously had a good battle through Turns 1 and 2 but obviously my teammate got jumped by Sergio so I was basically tagteamed by the Red Bulls. Its very very hard in strategy when you dont have both cars there. I think Sergio was able to come in and pull me in which definitely hindered our strategy. Q Were talking a lot about strategy  but what positives do you take from this weekend I mean was this the most competitive the car has been this year LH Yeah its so so many positives to take from this weekend. And yeah this is definitely the most competitive and the best the car has felt all year  and that is truly down to the amazing work from all the women and men back at the factory who have just been doing such an amazing job. And not giving up. I think its just been a real showing of resilience and perseverance. And Im so happy to be kindof back in that fight. We saw in the last race kindof almost having a chance to win. And I dont know what the car will be like in these next races. Im hoping in Brazil something special may come of it. But well see. Q Checo coming to you now. Another third place for you at home. How sweet was the podium this time SP It was always very sweet. Unfortunately I think today we could have been a bit higher you know we had a better stop. But at the end I think second or third doesnt really matter. As long as Im on the podium. It was great to have all these people. They have been amazing the whole weekend. And it was just nice to finish off the weekend with a podium. Q Lets go through the race in chronological order. Can you describe the opening few corners How crucial was it for you to pass George Russell at that point SP Yeah it was quite important to make some progress on lap one. So I managed to get George early on and then just stay with Max and Lewis throughout that first stint. And we boxed relatively early for the Medium which was going to be an undercut on Lewis but unfortunately we had a bad stop. And we just came behind the Ferraris a bit too far and that meant that we were just we lost too much time going through them. So yeah that was I think what really prevented us getting Lewis because I could see he was struggling in the early laps with the Hard tyre and that was our opportunity. Once you get them going he seemed to pull away a bit. And yeah unfortunately there was not much I could do because every time I was getting close to him things were overheating brakes engine tyres so I have very few chances to attack him. I use a few times ERS but no more than that. Q And youve retaken second place in the Drivers Championship five points ahead of Charles Leclerc. Do you feel youve got the momentum in that battle now SP It can change racetorace. For now I just want to go into the next two and aim for the win. Theres nothing more to lose so we will try everything. Its been a very difficult weekend with far too many issues so we need to put everything together and then I believe we can do the next step.

The 25yearolds 14th victory of the season sees him pass Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel for the most race wins in a single season in Formula One history. Earlier in October Verstappen claimed his second career world championship at the Japanese Grand Prix and last week he won the US Grand Prix in Austin Texas which saw him share the record for number of season race wins. With his victory in Mexico Verstappen also broke the record for the most points accumulated in a single season previously set by Lewis Hamilton in 2019. The records confirm Verstappens dominance this season. After an inauspicious start in Bahrain back in March he has won race after race comfortably seeing off an early challenge from Ferraris Charles Leclerc. Speaking after Sundays race at Autodromo Hermanos Rodrguez in Mexico City Mexico Verstappen looked forward to more success. An incredible result. Its been an incredible year so far. Were definitely enjoying it and well try to go for more the Dutch driver said. Seventime world champion Lewis Hamilton finished in second place some 15 seconds behind the Dutchman and Red Bulls Sergio Perez came in third. Max Verstappen celebrates his 14th victory of the season. Chris GraythenGetty Images Verstappen started on pole and glided away while Hamilton behind him overtook teammate George Russell. The two teams began on different tires  Mercedes on the mediums in the hope of challenging the Dutchmans dominance with Red Bull on the softs  and for a while the cars were evenly matched. Red Bull pitted their drivers first opting for medium tires while Hamilton fitted hard tires so that he would not have to pit again. Ultimately Mercedes strategy did not pay off as Hamilton could only watch Verstappen increase his lead and team boss Toto Wolff later acknowledged over the radio that it was maybe not the right tire choice according to the BBC. But for all of Verstappen and Red Bulls achievements this year there was a shadow cast over the team on Sunday after it was sanctioned for a budget cap breach last year. Red Bull Racing RBR and the FIA agreed an Accepted Breach Agreement ABA for the teams breaking of F1s cost cap rules in 2021 the sports governing body announced on Friday. RBR were found to have breached the cost cap by 432652 501409. Max Verstappen has now won eight of the last nine F1 races. Chris GraythenGetty Images The punishment amounts to a fine of 7 million a 10 reduction in cost limits for RBRs aerodynamic testing for next year and responsibility for the costs incurred by the Cost Cap Administration who were responsible for investigating the breach. In the FIA statement the Cost Cap Administration noted that RBR acted cooperatively throughout the review process and that there is no accusation or evidence that RBR has sought at any time to act in bad faith. The more draconian part is the sporting penalty which is a 10 reduction on our ability to utilise our wind tunnel and aerodynamic tools team boss Christian Horner said in a press conference according to ESPN. That represents anywhere between 0.25 seconds and 0.5 seconds of lap time. That comes in from now it has a direct effect on next years car and it will be in place for a 12month period. Two races remain on the F1 calendar for Verstappen to add to his record tally with the Brazilian Grand Prix scheduled on November 13 and the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on November 20.
Max Verstappen sets F1 wins record with 14th victory of the 2022 season, https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/2022/10/30/max-verstappen-sets-f1-season-wins-record-with-14th-victory-mexico/, MEXICO CITY  It quickly became clear this would be the year that Max Verstappen set the record for most wins in an F1 season. Verstappen set the F1 record for wins in a season Sunday at the Mexico City Grand Prix with his 14th victory of the season. I try to win races and that is the most important thing. The team has won 16 of 21 F1 races this season with Verstappen and Sergio Perez winner at Monaco and Singapore. But the fans love their native driver and before the race Perez took a ride around the track on the back of a convertible Volkswagen., MEXICO CITY  It quickly became clear this would be the year that Max Verstappen set the record for most wins in an F1 season. It was never a question of if the Dutchman would win 14 races. It was only a question of when. And now By how much will Verstappen ultimately shatter the mark he shared with Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel Verstappen set the F1 record for wins in a season Sunday at the Mexico City Grand Prix with his 14th victory of the season. It broke the record set by Schumacher in 2004 and tied by Vettel it 2013. Unbelievable what a season and what a fantastic race To achieve 14 wins in a season is down to all the hard work by everyone in the team lets keep this going redbullracing HondaRacingGLB pic.twitter.comnG6uMggIPA  Max Verstappen Max33Verstappen October 30 2022 Verstappen only shared the mark with the Germans for all of one week following his victory last Sunday at Circuit of the Americas in Texas. Paired with wins at Miami Montreal and now Mexico City Verstappen swept the North American portion of this years F1 schedule. Just another day for Verstappen. I was never really interested in stats Verstappen said. I always just live in the moment. I try to do the best I can every single weekend. I try to win races and that is the most important thing. I am not that interested in keeping up with every stat. It is amazing season and we are happy to be winning. Verstappen retained his F1 world championship with four races remaining in the season clinched the constructors championship for Red Bull with three races remaining in the season and has two races left to thoroughly demolish the winsinaseason record. Red Bull has won nine consecutive races tying the team record set in 2013. The team has won 16 of 21 F1 races this season with Verstappen and Sergio Perez winner at Monaco and Singapore. Lewis Hamilton finished second for the second consecutive week. He might have had a shot at his first win of the season but Mercedes made the wrong call on a tire change that gave Verstappen control. We didnt choose the right tire strategy in hindsight Hamilton said. Nonetheless to be this close to Red Bull makes me very proud of my team. Were getting closer to the front and we will continue to push. The last couple of races weve taken a big step forward with the car and I hope we will continue like this for the final two. Perez finished third on his home track for the second consecutive year  earning deafening cheers even though a Mexican driver has yet to win at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez. Perez has been mobbed by adoring fans all week in his return. It began with a demonstration run in his hometown of Guadalajara before he arrived at the circuit where Perez has been swarmed by crowds as soon as he enters the paddock. He had to use a back route to get to the Red Bull garage each ontrack session as drivers and teams complained most of the weekend that the spectators who had purchased paddock access were too aggressive. But the fans love their native driver and before the race Perez took a ride around the track on the back of a convertible Volkswagen. He often held his hand to his heart to show his appreciation to the 120000plus fans. Its been incredible honestly Perez told the crowd in Spanish after the race. Thank you for all the support youve given me this weekend. Youre incredible the best fan base. Thank you. The threeday weekend sold out in two minutes earlier this year and the threeday crowd of 395902 broke the mark set last year of 371779. F1 also said ahead of the race that it had extended its contract with the race  often voted most popular among fans  through 2025. The day belonged to Verstappen who started from the pole and won for the 34th time in his career. He held the lead at the start as Hamilton passed teammate George Russell for second and Perez also made it past Russell. Hamilton might have raced for the win and was the leader when he pitted and Mercedes chose the harder more durable tire compound. Verstappen had a softer and faster tire and Hamilton lacked the speed to challenge for the victory. Hamilton has two more chances to avoid the first winless season of his career. Pierre Gassly meanwhile earned another two penalty points for running Lance Stroll wide off track and the Frenchman is now one penalty point away from a onerace suspension.

In his recordextending fourth win in Mexico City Verstappen stretched his lead over Hamilton during the second half of the race to win by more than 15 seconds. What an unbelievable season said Verstappen speaking to Sky Sports after a 14th triumph of the campaign that moved him ahead of the record set by Michael Schumacher in 2004 and matched by Sebastian Vettel in 2013. Simply unstoppableMax33Verstappen makes it an extraordinary FOURTEEN wins in 2022 breaking the record for the most wins in a season2TheMax MexicoGP pic.twitter.comTE7mOJ9o4b  Formula 1 F1 October 30 2022 Its an incredible atmosphere. We love to come here. Its been an incredible year so far. We are definitely enjoying it and we will try to go for more. Red Bulls Sergio Perez could not become the first Mexican to win the race but was enthusiastically roared on as he finished third ahead of Mercedes George Russell. Tyre troubles thwart Mercedes Hamilton reflected that Mercedes should have joined Red Bull in starting on soft rather than medium tyres after the seventime champion repeatedly struggled having started on mediums and switched to hard tyres after 25 laps. Russell wanted to be switched to soft tyres and Mercedes boss Toto Wolff whose team had told Hamilton during the race that their rivals on mediums would falter accepted that they had made the wrong choice. That should not reduce the credit afforded to Verstappen for achieving the rare feat of starting on pole in Mexico City and maintaining the lead beyond the first corner. Hamilton had been on blistering early form and the race felt in the balance before his tyre change which heralded Verstappen gradually pulling away. Russell briefly led and Hamilton was left to rue what might have been during a race lacking drama as Verstappen celebrated at the end. I would have been really intrigued to see what would have happened if we had started with the medium and gone on to the soft said Russell adding that he had felt like he was driving on ice. Mega job everyone Thanks for continuing to push. They were just too quick for us today. But lets keep pushing. Were getting closer. pic.twitter.com7JRblD6ouD  MercedesAMG PETRONAS F1 Team MercedesAMGF1 October 30 2022 Seventime champion Hamilton failed to secure his first win of the season and said Ultimately maybe they had the better tyre strategy. Im not sure it was the right tyre in the end  we should have started on the soft. Congratulations to Max. Perez pride on homecoming Perez had started in fourth with a fervent fanbase hoping the driver known as Checo would challenge in his seventh home Grand Prix. In search of a fifth race win of his career the man who comes from a motorsport family was passionately supported by relatives including his father Antonio Perez Garibay. Perez senior watched intently with headphones on during the race and showed as much pride as he did energy when he waved the Mexican flag while his son took to the podium. The atmosphere would have been sensational had Perez won but his performance in separating the Mercedes pairing was met with vigour by the crowd. Mercedes had gambled that Perezs medium tyres would cause him to fade and allow Russell through in the closing laps but he finished more than 31 seconds clear. Overtaking was so difficult so I had to stay in third Perez said afterwards. I thought we were going to be a little closer but it didnt work out. Its a good podium. In front of this crowd I wanted more  but third place is still a good day.

Poor Kevin Magnussen who was having trouble before the race is last at the moment. Mick Schumachers two places ahead of him. A forgettable one for Haas. Lap 7 The gap between Russell and the top two is widening. Its still Verstappen Hamilton Perez and Russell making up the top four with Carlos Sainz in fifth. Lap 6 Perez is pesky for Mercedes in the battle with Red Bull preventing them from ganging up on Verstappen. Lap 5 Interesting to overhear the instructions being given to Alfa Romeos Valtteri Bottas in eighth. Theyre telling the Finn that hes in a strong position and advising him to stick to whatever their original prerace plan was. Lap 3 Hamilton takes about 0.3 seconds off Verstappens lead with the fastest lap of the race so far reducing it to 1.2 seconds. Perez remains third. Fernando Alonso who didnt sound terribly optimistic before the race has moved up two places to seventh. Lap 1 Kudos to Verstappen who has the rare distinction of holding the lead from pole around Turn One in Mexico. Hamilton in second leads Russell but its all about Perez for most of the fans who respond in kind as their man makes a strong start by taking Russells spot in third 5 mins until lights out Verstappen starts on soft tyres. Russell and Hamilton are on mediums which means they should be able to last longer before taking a pit stop. Intriguing.

Verstappen whose Red Bull team opted for a softmedium tyre strategy took the chequered flag some 15 seconds clear of Hamilton who was left to question why Mercedes swapped their starting set of mediums for hards. But after experiencing technical problems throughout the qualifying hour Checo had to make do with fourth on the grid lining up behind polesitting Red Bull team mate Verstappen and the Mercedes cars of Russell and Hamilton. Alonso had been firmly in that fight behind the Red Bull Mercedes and Ferrari cars but a failure failure with just six laps to go ended his afternoon and added a fresh twist in the battle for P4 in the constructors standings. Verstappen has now achieved the most race wins in a single F1 season, Max Verstappen claimed his 14th victory of the 2022 season in the Mexico City Grand Prix ahead of Mercedes rival Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull team mate Sergio Perez after an intriguing strategic battle played out at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez. It secures another record for the Dutchman in his burgeoning career as he now boasts the most wins in a single F1 campaign moving one clear of the 13 achieved by Michael Schumacher 2004 and Sebastian Vettel 2013. Verstappen whose Red Bull team opted for a softmedium tyre strategy took the chequered flag some 15 seconds clear of Hamilton who was left to question why Mercedes swapped their starting set of mediums for hards. Perez gave the home fans something to cheer about in third having threatened to challenge Hamilton late on while Russell  who lost out to his team mate at the start  took a distant fourth. FORMULA 1 GRAN PREMIO DE LA CIUDAD DE MXICO 2022 Mexico 2022 Race results POSITION TIME POINTS 1 Max Verstappen VER Red Bull Racing 13836.729 25 2 Lewis Hamilton HAM Mercedes 15.186s 18 3 Sergio Perez PER Red Bull Racing 18.097s 15 4 George Russell RUS Mercedes 49.431s 13 5 Carlos Sainz SAI Ferrari 58.123s 10 Russell was also unhappy with his strategy repeatedly asking Mercedes to pit again and ditch the hard tyres which failed to bring the race back to the Silver Arrows in the closing stages  a stop for softs with two laps to run at least yielding the fastest lap. Ferrari endured a lacklustre race as Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc claimed lonely P5 and P6 finishes ahead of McLaren driver Daniel Ricciardo who charged his way to seventh with soft tyres late on and kept the position despite a 10second time penalty for a clash with Yuki Tsunoda. Esteban Ocon placed eighth after a painful late retirement for Alpine team mate Fernando Alonso as the other McLaren of Lando Norris and Alfa Romeos Valtteri Bottas  not quite able to repeat his qualifying performance  completed the points. Strategy played a key role throughout Sundays race in Mexico City AlphaTauri driver Pierre Gasly picked up a fivesecond penalty for an early aggressive move on Aston Martin rival Lance Stroll and ultimately missed out on a point by just half a second with Alex Albon 12th for Williams. Zhou Guanyu got his Alfa Romeo to the line ahead of Aston Martin pair Vettel  sporting a touching tribute helmet to the late Dietrich Mateschitz  and Stroll followed by the Haas cars of Mick Schumacher and Kevin Magnussen. Nicholas Latifi was the final finisher in his Williams with the aforementioned Alonso grinding to a halt with an engine issue late on and Tsunoda retiring after briefly going airborne in his collision with Ricciardo. Race Highlights 2022 Mexico City Grand Prix AS IT HAPPENED A sellout crowd delivered a party atmosphere in the build up to Sundays race with the every move of home hero Perez being enthusiastically cheered as had been the case throughout practice and qualifying earlier in the weekend. But after experiencing technical problems throughout the qualifying hour Checo had to make do with fourth on the grid lining up behind polesitting Red Bull team mate Verstappen and the Mercedes cars of Russell and Hamilton. Intriguingly Verstappen and Perez opted for soft tyres to attack the run of more than 800 metres to Turn 1 with Russell and Hamilton going for mediums  meaning there would be an array of strategic permutations to keep an eye on as the encounter developed. At the back Haas driver Magnussen started 19th with a fiveplace grid penalty for an engine change with Aston Martins Stroll in P20  having been docked three places for his clash with Alpine rival Alonso in Austin. When the lights went out and the 71lap race roared into life Verstappen made a clean getaway to defend from the Mercedes drivers off the line and down to Turn 1 before Hamilton pounced on Russell in the middle of the first chicane to take P2. As Verstappen held the lead at the start Hamilton got the jump on Russell for P2 Perez then got a run on Russell exiting the tight Turn 123 complex and having jumped out of the slipstream swept around the outside of his rival at Turn 4 sparking another deafening roar in the grandstands lining the circuit as he moved into the podium places. Sainz held fifth in his Ferrari with the Alfa Romeo of qualifying star Bottas dropping back to eighth behind the other F175 of Leclerc and between the Alpines of Alonso and Ocon  McLaren driver Norris rounding out the top 10. In the early laps Hamilton went with leader Verstappen and initially sat little more than a second adrift of his 2021 title rival before dropping back by a few tenths  engine cooling a crucial factor for consideration amid the high altitude and warm temperatures. You just need to try and break this tow. Youre doing a great job was the message to Verstappen shortly afterwards with almost two seconds separating himself and Hamilton by Lap 10 when attention started to turn to the pit stops. Verstappen edged away from Hamilton before the focus turned to the pit lane Some drama in the midfield involved Gasly forcing his way past Stroll under braking for Turn 4 on Lap 14 but the stewards quickly determined that the AlphaTauri man had forced the Aston Martin off the track and handed him a fivesecond time penalty. While Verstappen continued to edge away from Hamilton up front Perez sat around six seconds off the lead and Russell 7.5s as Sainz and Leclerc settled into a quiet race of their own  the Ferraris struggling to live with the pace of the Red Bull and Mercedes machines. As the race moved past the 20lap mark Verstappen reported some tyre concerns  at one point stating the left front doesnt want to turn  with Red Bull stretching out their opening stint on softs and the Mercedes duo biding their time on the more durable mediums. Perez was the first of the frontrunners to pit on Lap 24 swapping his softs for mediums in a tardy fivesecond stop due to a sticking rearleft tyre with Verstappen pitting two laps later releasing Hamilton and Russell into the lead. While Perez fell behind yettostop Ferrari pair Sainz and Leclerc forcing him to pull off some extra overtaking and spark further cheers from the home fans Verstappen slotted into P3 some 20 seconds off new leader Hamilton who reported that my tyres are okay. Hamilton did all he could to keep the pressure on Verstappen and Red Bull Nonetheless on Lap 30 Hamilton and Mercedes decided it was time to pit switching from mediums to hards while Russell asked to extend his stint and aim to bolt on a set of softs in the closing stages of the race. Russell temporarily led Verstappen by some 10 seconds with Hamilton six seconds further back but lighting up the timing screens on the harder tyres  giving his team mate some extra information to consider ahead of his own stop. Russells soft tyre ambitions were shortlived as he boxed on Lap 35 to follow Hamilton onto the hard tyres rejoining the action in fourth around 16 seconds off the lead before being told to lift and coast for the remainder of the race. His initially competitive pace on the hards fading Hamilton reported that they did not feel as comfortable as the mediums and Russell soon joined him on the radio to question the strategic move  but Mercedes sought to reassure both drivers that the race would come back to them. Further back Sainz and Leclerc continued their race as the best of the rest as Ocon joined Alonso in getting past Bottas with a fine move to put the Alpines in P7 and P8 respectively  Norris keeping his hands on the final point with 20 laps to run. There was plenty of midfield scrapping between Bottas and the Alpines On Lap 51 Norriss team mate Ricciardo tipped the AlphaTauri of Tsunoda into the air at Turn 6 amid a fierce wheeltowheel scrap prompting the stewards to hand the Australian a 10second time penalty  Tsunoda pitting to retire his damaged car. But the punishment appeared to fire Ricciardo up as he used his relatively fresh soft tyres to pass Norris Bottas Alonso and Ocon moving up to P7 and doing all he could to build enough of a margin and still emerge with some points. With the race entering its final 15 laps Verstappen found himself leading Hamilton by more than 10 seconds while Perez closed in on the Mercedes in a bid to bag another Red Bull onetwo finish  both Hamilton and Russell continuing to question the mediumhard strategy. Despite further reassurances from the Mercedes pit wall that the race would come their way in the form of the Red Bulls hitting late tyre trouble Verstappen had no such problems and eked out a 15second winning margin. Perez was unable to reel in Hamilton for P2 but at least made the podium in his home race while Russell pitted with two laps to run to bolt on a set of softs and score an extra point with the fastest lap. Verstappen celebrates victory number 14 of the season in front of the Mexican fans Sainz and Leclerc finished around a minute behind Verstappen while Ricciardo did just enough to build the required 10second margin over Ocon for P7 as Norris and Bottas rounded out the pointspaying positions. Alonso had been firmly in that fight behind the Red Bull Mercedes and Ferrari cars but a failure failure with just six laps to go ended his afternoon and added a fresh twist in the battle for P4 in the constructors standings. Gasly and Albon narrowly missed out on points for AlphaTauri and Williams with Zhou having to settle for P13 in the second Alfa Romeo followed by the Aston Martins of Vettel and Stroll. Haas also left emptyhanded as Schumacher led Magnussen home in P16 and P17 respectively with Latifi the last driver to take the chequered flag after Alonso and Tsunodas retirements. Verstappen has now achieved the most race wins in a single F1 season

Hamilton: Red Bull "too fast" for Mercedes to beat in F1 Mexican GP, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/hamilton-red-bull-too-fast-for-mercedes-to-beat-in-f1-mexican-gp/10393051/, I was so close I think in that first stint Hamilton said of his initial stint on the medium tyres but I think the Red Bull was just clearly too fast today. Im not sure the hard was the right tyre in the end. It was OK in the first stint but the hard tyre was just offset. Hamilton had to be content with second 15s off Verstappen by the end as the Red Bull pace showed little sign of dying down. Verstappen then made a gain of time in the pitstop phase and got his lead to over 10s as Hamilton struggled to stabilise the gap on the hard tyres., Listen to this article Both Hamilton and George Russell began the race on medium tyres with Mercedes trying to counter Red Bulls start on the soft rubber as Max Verstappen wanted to cover off the threat of a run into the first corner. Although it seemed that Mercedes was going to attempt to go long into the race on the mediums and switch to softs at the end the team instead made the jump to hards with Hamilton before halfdistance with Russell following suit. The pair could occasionally match the Red Bulls on pace but the gambit of waiting for the medium tyres on Verstappen and Sergio Perezs cars to fade away did not work as tyre wear proved low throughout the race. I was so close I think in that first stint Hamilton said of his initial stint on the medium tyres but I think the Red Bull was just clearly too fast today. Ultimately maybe they had the better tyre strategy. Im not sure the hard was the right tyre in the end. I thought we should have started on the soft obviously we had the opposite tyre. It was OK in the first stint but the hard tyre was just offset. Congratulations to Max its great to be up here and separate the two. Hamilton had to be content with second 15s off Verstappen by the end as the Red Bull pace showed little sign of dying down. The Briton had been around two seconds behind Verstappen on the opening stint as the race settled down but was unable to arrest the steady progression of the gap out in front. Verstappen then made a gain of time in the pitstop phase and got his lead to over 10s as Hamilton struggled to stabilise the gap on the hard tyres. This grew amid the virtual safety car period for Fernando Alonso as the Alpine drivers engine died in the late stages of the race. Perez had got close to Hamilton in the second phase of the race even getting to within DRS range but the Mexican was unable to find a way past at his home race. I gave my best today and really pushed hard Perez said after the race. But overtaking is so difficult. As soon as I got behind him it was really difficult to follow. I had to take third.

The two penalty points take Gasly to 10 in a 12month period. That is just two from a race ban and he will not lose any of his existing penalty points until next May. Read moreThe strict nature of the F1 penalty points system has been criticised by several drivers at various times in recent years. The stewards are supposedly limited with what they can do as there is effectively a set list of sanctions and associated licence penalty points to choose from., Pierre Gasly is on the brink of a race ban in Formula 1 after picking up another penalty in the Mexican Grand Prix. Gasly was given a fivesecond time penalty and one licence point for gaining advantage by going off track  and forcing Lance Stroll to do likewise  while making a pass in the opening stint of the race . The AlphaTauri driver locked up and ran deep into Turn 4 going beyond the white line himself with Stroll on the outside. The two penalty points take Gasly to 10 in a 12month period. That is just two from a race ban and he will not lose any of his existing penalty points until next May. It means Gasly must complete the final two races of 2022 and the first seven races of next year without any incidents that earn him two penalty points. GASLYS PENALTY SITUATION Offence Penalty points Spain Collision with Stroll 2 Austria Collision with Vettel 2 Austria Leaving the track without a justifiable reason multiple times 1 Japan Speeding under red flag conditions 2 United States Fell more than 10 car lengths behind during the safety car 2 Mexico Going off track and gaining advantage in Stroll pass 1 Gasly had acknowledged earlier in the weekend that he was quite close to being banned for a race expressed frustration to be in the position when I dont feel like Ive been that dangerous over the last 12 months. It would be a shame to get a race ban for slowing down a bit too much behind the safety car and a couple of track limits infringements this year he said. Alpine move is Gaslys shot at redemption  but will he use it Read more The strict nature of the F1 penalty points system has been criticised by several drivers at various times in recent years. Currently any penalty issued also comes with licence points by default. The stewards are supposedly limited with what they can do as there is effectively a set list of sanctions and associated licence penalty points to choose from. Gasly suggested that the FIA is working on it and claimed probably for next year theres going to be changes. At the moment youre losing points for these safetycar infringements or track limits and obviously the penalty for it is a race ban which we all agree and also the stewards agree is quite harsh said Gasly. I think theyre working on it and theres something that should be different for next year.
F1 Mexican GP: Verstappen cruises to record 14th victory of 2022, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/f1-mexican-gp-verstappen-cruises-to-record-14th-victory-of-2022/10393007/, Home hero Sergio Perez finished third ahead of George Russell with the Ferrari drivers a minute behind by the finish in fifth and sixth. Just before they braked for Turn 1 Russell moved left to the outside line but ended up just following Verstappen through the right hander and deep towards the grass runoff on the outside. As Verstappen scampered through unopposed Russell bounced over the kerbs at Turn 2 with Hamilton by this time alongside his teammate and getting ahead with better drive out of Turn 3. Leclerc the last car on the lead lap and 10s behind his teammate the drama to the finish concerned McLarens Daniel Ricciardo. In clear air from there Ricciardo charged and eventually finished 12.1s ahead of Ocon to negate his penalty., After acing the start from pole and once it became clear well ahead of the final laps that his medium tyres would hold on Verstappen dominated to take a 14th victory of 2022 and in doing so set a new record for single season wins. Home hero Sergio Perez finished third ahead of George Russell with the Ferrari drivers a minute behind by the finish in fifth and sixth. At the start Verstappen launched well in front of Russell and swung right in front of the Mercedes on the very long run down to the first corner  with Russell gaining from the Red Bulls slipstream to run ahead of Hamilton and Perez. Just before they braked for Turn 1 Russell moved left to the outside line but ended up just following Verstappen through the right hander and deep towards the grass runoff on the outside. As Verstappen scampered through unopposed Russell bounced over the kerbs at Turn 2 with Hamilton by this time alongside his teammate and getting ahead with better drive out of Turn 3. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes W13 Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images There Russell came along Hamilton but ran out of room and had to climb over the kerbs therefore losing momentum and being jumped the quickly arriving Perez into Turn 4 at the end of the second straight. Verstappen immediately moved out of DRS threat at the end of lap one of 71 with Hamilton giving chase having started on the medium tyres as did Russell compared to the used softs fitted to the two Red Bulls. Over the next phase of the race the gap between the leaders fluctuated slightly but generally held around 1.5s as Perez and Russell ran a few seconds further adrift and falling further behind over the course of the first stint. Approaching the end of the races first quarter Verstappen upped his pace in a bid to break the tow to the Mercedes but Hamilton was able to hang on just over two seconds behind before the leaders softs began to give up. From a maximum of 2.4s Verstappens advantage was down to 1.6s by the time he came in at the end of lap 25  one tour after Perez had pitted and suffered a slow leftrear change that left him stationary for 5.0s. Running the more durable tyre Mercedes left Hamilton out  his mediums showing none of the dark wear patches that had been evident on Verstappnens leftfront soft before he stopped. But Hamilton only remained out for another four laps before he was brought in to switch to the hard tyres with Mercedes instead leaving Russell out to complete a much longer first stint. He therefore led until the end of lap 34 Verstappen cycling back into the lead at halfdistance with a near seven second lead and Hamilton under more pressure from Perez running closely behind  the Mexican driver having cleared the offthepace Ferrari pair after his slow stop. Max Verstappen Red Bull Racing RB18 Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images Hamilton suggested the hards were not performing as well as the mediums he had given up with Mercedes in turn implying performance drop off logged at the end of his first stint might give him a chance to catch Verstappen late on. That looked a mighty ask 15 laps into Hamiltons second as he faced a near 10s gap to the dominant leader but at least able to keep Perez at arms length just a few seconds behind. Indeed the status quo continued to hold with Hamilton questioning whether his hard tyre set was the right compound to be on and Mercedes insisting it was due to its added durability on a onestopper. But with Verstappen continuing to edge away by a few tenths each lap as the leaders made their way through traffic with 15 laps left he had a lead of 12.1s. As it turned out Mercedes hoped for dramatic pace drop off for Red Bull never happened and Verstappen romped home to win by 15.1s having completed a mammoth 46lap final stint on the mediums. A late race stoppage for Fernando Alonso who had been running comfortably in seventh before an engine issue caused him to lose pace and eventually stop in the Turn 1 runoff did not cause much of a disruption other than a short virtual safety car activation on laps 6566. Perez ended up 2.9s behind Hamilton having fallen further behind shortly before the VSC with Russell fourth and also vocally frustrated about having to run the hards in his second stint. That ended up only being his middle stint as Mercedes pitted Russell to take the softs for a final lap shot at the fastest lap bonus point which the Briton duly secured with a 1m20.153s. Carlos Sainz Ferrari F175 Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images Carlos Sainz led Charles Leclerc home in an anonymous race for Ferrari  the Spaniard ending up 58.8s adrift of Verstappen and the only action for the pair involving Perezs poststop passing and Sainz doing likewise to Alonso after his own service to go from softs to mediums. Leclerc the last car on the lead lap and 10s behind his teammate the drama to the finish concerned McLarens Daniel Ricciardo. He had produced the second longest opening stint on the mediums in staying out until lap 45 after which he was rapid on the softs but made a bad error hitting Yuki Tsunoda at Turn 6 a few laps after his pitstop. With the AlphaTauri retiring in the pits Ricciardo was handed a 10stime addition penalty which he overcame with a sterling drive up the field after being waved by teammate Lando Norris who was completing the mediumhard strategy. Ricciardo produced pass after pass  including being part of a double move on Alonso into Turn 1 shortly before the Spaniard retired with his teammate Esteban Ocon going by ahead of Ricciardo into Turn 1 before in turn being caught and passed by the Australian. In clear air from there Ricciardo charged and eventually finished 12.1s ahead of Ocon to negate his penalty. Norris and Valtteri Bottas who had dropped back on lap one after his fine qualifying and then battled the Alpines in the first and middle phases of the race before falling back completing the top 10. Tsunoda was the races only other retirement.

Weve broken down everything you need to know in order to stream todays race and all the other F1 races this season. Dan IstiteneFormula 1Getty Images What is F1 and how is it different from IndyCar Both IndyCar and F1 are openwheeled singleseater racing formats. This means that the cars can only fit one person and have uncovered wheels that protrude from the body of the vehicle. Despite their basic similarities F1 and IndyCar offer very different experiences. In F1 there are only 10 teams with two drivers apiece for a total of 20 drivers. Most races must go for 305 km which is about 190 miles. Each driver needs to use two different tires in the race so a pit stop is mandatory though cars are not allowed to refuel. Races average around two hours in length and are held at venues all over the world. Teams spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year developing their cars. All cars must have certain elements  for example gearboxes must have eight gears plus a reverse and last for six consecutive races  but teams have leeway to tweak and change some parts of their car including their engines in the pursuit of speed. In contrast the cars featured in IndyCar are more standardized. They all have the same aerodynamic kit and chassis and can only be powered by one of two engines  either a Honda or a Chevrolet. That said teams are allowed to develop some of their own parts like dampers and some of their suspensions. IndyCar races occur on a wide range of tracks from fast ovals to road and street courses. The length of the races also varies with some like the Indianapolis 500 lasting 500 laps and taking over three hours to complete. Not surprisingly refueling during pit stops is a big part of the strategy during IndyCar races. Teams can field more than two cars meaning that the amount of drivers on the grid fluctuates from race to race. IndyCar is mostly considered an American sport and does not have the same level of money and glamour associated with it compared to the globehopping F1 circuit. Why should I care about F1 F1 races might best be described as a sort of actionpacked chess match that takes place while drivers are throttling around a track at close to 200 mph. Teams need both strategy and skill to compete against some of the best minds in motorsports. F1 is also full of strong personalities. The Netflix documentary series F1 Drive to Survive follows many of the teams and drivers over the course of a year and has helped raise the profile of the sport in the US. Released in March season four of the series chronicles last years tight championship race between rivals Verstappen and Hamilton. It also focuses on the internal battles between drivers on the same team while giving viewers a peek into the tense pressurized world of elite racing. Does F1 stream on ESPN Plus ESPN does not air any F1 coverage on its ESPN Plus streaming service. If you want to watch the practices or races you will need a television provider of some kind or to pay for F1s 80 per season TV Pro subscription.

Wolff: Mexico is Mercedes’ best F1 chance yet of winning this season, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/wolff-mexico-mercedes-best-f1-chance-win/10392576/, Mercedes has typically performed better in race pace than through qualifying but team principal Wolff was uneasy about expressing confidence it had the car to win on Sunday. I think in all my life theres only a handful of occasions that Ive been confident and never in Formula 1 said Wolff. Asked if this was Mercedes best shot of winning a race so far this year Wolff replied Yeah I think so. The good thing is that in our simulations we had Mexico in a way on the radar as being the best race. For many years Mexico wasnt a good place for us because of the altitude said Wolff., Listen to this article George Russell and Lewis Hamilton fell threetenths of a second short of Max Verstappens pole position lap for Red Bull but struggled on their last run in Q3. Russell called his final lap terrible while Hamilton had an engine oscillation problem that impacted his last effort as he reported feeling power drop outs. Both Mercedes cars may benefit from getting a tow from Verstappen on the run from the starting grid to Turn 1 which is one of the longest of the season. Mercedes has typically performed better in race pace than through qualifying but team principal Wolff was uneasy about expressing confidence it had the car to win on Sunday. I think in all my life theres only a handful of occasions that Ive been confident and never in Formula 1 said Wolff. So the truth is I dont know. Im annoyed about not being on pole because it would have ticked a box but equally having Max with his top speed advantage behind us would have been a problem tomorrow. Starting second and third can be advantageous and I hope we can stick our nose or both noses into Turn 1 and disappear into the distance. But definitely thats going to be difficult. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes AMG on the grid after Qualifying Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images Mercedes has three races left to avoid its first winless campaign since 2011 having struggled to match the pace of Red Bull and Ferrari through much of the season. Asked if this was Mercedes best shot of winning a race so far this year Wolff replied Yeah I think so. The good thing is that in our simulations we had Mexico in a way on the radar as being the best race. So that is good that it correlates the virtual world correlates with the real world. The most important thing is that we really have the pace and slowly but surely we are going forward and learning the lessons for next year. One of the biggest boosts for Mercedes in Mexico came with the highaltitude conditions leading to reduced levels of drag in the thin air as well as allowing for high downforce packages to be used. For many years Mexico wasnt a good place for us because of the altitude said Wolff. But the power unit guys have really given us a super strong engine here. We suffered less from our draggy car here whilst running high downforce like all the others. Generally that has been better for us in the past.
Bottas aiming high from “surprising” sixth on Mexico F1 grid, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/bottas-aiming-high-from-surprising-sixth-on-mexico-f1-grid/10392717/, Yeah then its a pretty good day he said when asked by Motorsport.com about beating Leclercs works car. I mean weve seen from the beginning of the weekend that we seem pretty strong and I felt comfortable. But I think the layout  I was thinking about it before the weekend that it could be good for our car. I think all those slow speed corners we seem pretty strong. If you can gain obviously yes but without huge risk.Alfa Romeo team principal Fred Vasseur said that the car has been quick in recent races even if grid positions didnt fully reflect that., Listen to this article The Alfa Romeo driver split the two works Ferraris in qualifying outpacing the troubled Charles Leclerc for a spot on the third row of the grid. A good result on Sunday would be hugely valuable in his teams fight with Aston Martin for sixth in the championship which the Hinwil outfit leads by just three points. Bottas showed good pace from the start of the Mexican weekend taking seventh in FP1 and eighth in FP3 the two sessions not compromised by Pirelli 2023 tyre testing. However even he hadnt anticipated doing even better when it mattered in qualifying. Yeah then its a pretty good day he said when asked by Motorsport.com about beating Leclercs works car. And surprising. I mean weve seen from the beginning of the weekend that we seem pretty strong and I felt comfortable. So we thought with a good quali should be able to fight for seventh place but to split the Ferraris is an added bonus. Valtteri Bottas Alfa Romeo C42 Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images Bottas had no definitive explanation for why the Alfa is so strong in Mexico City especially given that the works Ferraris have experienced a loss of power at the highaltitude venue. Its a good question he said. We didnt add anything from Austin to this track. But I think the layout  I was thinking about it before the weekend that it could be good for our car. And it seems to be really good for our car. I think all those slow speed corners we seem pretty strong. Even over the kerbs through the chicanes we seem good and the car feels quite nice over the kerbs. So I think it just suits this track and then with the starting setup we had for the weekend weve only had to do small fine tuning. So we really started the weekend on the right foot with a setup and been able to build on that. Bottas acknowledged that he always goes well at the track It feels like its been normally good track for me overall. I think I had a pole last year. So naturally that just tells that its one of those tracks that some drivers like. I like this one smooth surfaces low grip. So its definitely a bit different way of driving which I dont mind. Bottas believes he can maintain position on Sunday given that there are no obviously quicker cars behind  other than Leclercs Ferrari which may be compromised by ongoing engine issues. Asked if he can stay sixth he said I think so thats the target.And it seems like from all the long runs this this weekend and even the Pirelli tests that we seem to be on the good end of the midfield in terms of race pace. So its good to see. So hopefully we can more or less maintain the position. Thats important because its a good opportunity as Aston is now way back. Given how important the points are for his team Bottas agreed that he cant be too aggressive on the first lap. Yeah its a calculated risk. Ive had many bad luck lap ones this this year. So even for my confidence would be good to have a good start and lap one so I think target is at least try and maintain the position. If you can gain obviously yes but without huge risk. Alfa Romeo team principal Fred Vasseur said that the car has been quick in recent races even if grid positions didnt fully reflect that. I think it was already the case the last two or three events the Frenchman told Motorsport.com. But between having the potential and being P6 there is a margin. And the last two or three events were wet sessions or we missed Q3 for nothing. I think the pace was okay in Austin and Suzuka. And I think from the beginning of this weekend we were on it. From FP1 we are doing a good job and then you can fine tune the situation. Vasseur said the result was a boost for the Swiss team just days after the 2026 Audi deal was announced Its encouraging for the people at home and on track. Its a mega huge push. They worked a lot. We are still 250 less people than our competitors and it means that when we have to bring updates they are pushing like hell and Im more than pleased for everybody.

Schumacher calls for F1 bollard change after track limits frustration, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/schumacher-calls-for-bollard-change-after-track-limits-frustration/10392729/, Had it stood until the end of the session it would still have been good enough for seventh. However the time was quickly deleted by the stewards for cutting track limits on the apex of Turn 2. At the end of the session Schumacher was left stranded in 16th. If we have a bollard it would be great if the bollard was positioned in such a manner that youre not able to go over track limits. We changed rear wing changed floor changed front wing because weve had some suspicions about what we were running., Listen to this article The Haas driver logged a lap of 1m19.965s towards the end of Q1 which at the time put him in sixth place. Had it stood until the end of the session it would still have been good enough for seventh. However the time was quickly deleted by the stewards for cutting track limits on the apex of Turn 2. At the end of the session Schumacher was left stranded in 16th. Schumacher admitted that he had been aggressive in taking a lot of kerb but said hed used the bollard on the apex as a reference  and suggested that it should have been placed in such a way that drivers couldnt be deemed to cut the corner if they aimed to brush past it. Well I knew it was aggressive he said when asked by Motorsport.com about the incident. But in my eyes it was going to be enough. If the bollard is there its there for a reason. I took reference off that. Unfortunately I think thats a point that well probably have to address because with these cars obviously these days its hard to see. If we have a bollard it would be great if the bollard was positioned in such a manner that youre not able to go over track limits. That would definitely help a lot all of us for sure. So yeah quite unfortunate. The difference of cutting it that much or not its probably less than a tenth. When Schumacher made a final attempt on used tyres he was also compromised when other drivers passed him before he could start the lap. He said that violated the gentlemans agreement about not passing other cars on preparation laps. It was always going to be tough he said. But I think more than that it was also the gentlemans agreement that wasnt kept by like three or four cars. Which was silly really. But its the way it is. It definitely hurt the preparation of the lap which meant I couldnt warm up the brakes just as much as I wanted it to and going to Turn 1 with the question mark. Kevin Magnussen Haas VF22 Photo by Mark Sutton  Motorsport Images Meanwhile Schumachers teammate Kevin Magnussen earned 15th in Q2 and then dropped back to 19th thanks to a grid penalty for a taking a new V6 engine. The team made significant changes to his car for qualifying. We treated qualifying a little bit like a test said the Dane when asked by Motorsport.com about the session. We changed rear wing changed floor changed front wing because weve had some suspicions about what we were running. So the car did change around a lot. And we had to really go a completely different direction on the front flap to get the balance to be similar. So theres some stuff to look at tonight for sure. Asked if the car was better in its revised form he conceded that it was hard to tell. It might be but we were just so far off that we never really got back into the right spot he explained. You only get so many chances in qualifying. He also admitted that the team may now decide to make further changes that would oblige him to sacrifice 19th on the grid and start from the pitlane For sure were thinking about that.

Leclerc fears “nightmare” Mexican GP after Ferrari F1 qualifying woes, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/leclerc-fears-nightmare-mexico-f1-race-after-ferrari-qualifying-woes/10392704/, Telemetry indicated to the pit that the DRS had operated correctly but the aero engineers could see that Leclerc still had full load. There was something strange or wrong with the engine he said when asked by Autosport about his qualifying session. And also the engine was not really responding to the throttle input I was having in the high speed. And Red Bull and Mercedes seems to be stronger than that for the whole weekend. But for me FP3 and qualifying there was something more specific that I dont know yet what the problem was., Both Leclerc and teammate Carlos Sainz have experienced a lack of power at the highaltitude circuit with some rivals suspecting that the team may have detuned its power units in a search for reliability. Earlier this year Sainz suffered a fiery engine failure at the Red Bull Ring another venue where altitude is an issue and a nonfinish in Mexico could be costly in the teams battle for second place in the championship. Leclerc suffered more than his teammate on Saturday and he also had a DRS issue on the back straight in his final run in Q3 leaving him only seventh on the grid. Telemetry indicated to the pit that the DRS had operated correctly but the aero engineers could see that Leclerc still had full load. Leclercs weekend had already been compromised by a heavy crash in FP2 which damaged his gearbox. There was something strange or wrong with the engine he said when asked by Autosport about his qualifying session. I was losing quite a lot of time down the straights from FP3 to Q3 not compared to the Red Bull or Mercedes because this has been the case since day one and we knew it. There was something strange. And also the engine was not really responding to the throttle input I was having in the high speed. So I really hope we can fix those issues for tomorrow. Otherwise its going to be an extremely difficult race to be to be consistent. Carlos Sainz Ferrari F175 Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images Both Ferraris looked tricky in the highspeed corners but Leclerc admitted that it was hard for him to judge Its very difficult to comment on the balance because there was really a lot of inconsistency in the highspeed and it would not do exactly what I wanted with the engine. So I will get surprised and then get a snap. So yeah its difficult to compare the balance because it felt quite good when the engine was responding to what I was doing. But it was just very inconsistent. He added It was quite tricky on the kerbs. Unfortunately also on the bumps there were things that were happening that were very weird. Sainz who qualified in fifth indicated that he felt that unusually the Ferrari will be stronger in Sundays race than it was in qualifying. However Leclerc was not so optimistic. Again unfortunately I cannot comment on my side. If I still have the same issues then the race will be a nightmare. So I hope we can fix that. Leclerc insisted that his engine problem wasnt just down to the circuits altitude This this is the case since the beginning of FP1 with the altitude you lose a bit of performance. And Red Bull and Mercedes seems to be stronger than that for the whole weekend. But for me FP3 and qualifying there was something more specific that I dont know yet what the problem was.
Mercedes: F1 engine issue "definitely affected" Hamilton’s Mexico Q3 lap, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/mercedes-f1-hamilton-engine-issue-mexico-q3-lap/10392581/, Verstappen beat Russell and Hamilton to pole by three tenths of a second as both Mercedes drivers struggled in their final Q3 runs. Russell called his last lap terrible after running wide at Turn 12 and failing to improve his time while Hamilton revealed after the session that he felt an engine issue in Q3. We had some problem with the engine towards the end and in Q3 he said. But Ill find out from the team.Toto Wolff Team Principal and CEO Mercedes AMG Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport ImagesAsked by Motorsport.com about the issue Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff said there was an oscillation that had been spotted on Hamiltons engine. Nevertheless I think its a good result for the team second and third., Listen to this article Mercedes entered qualifying chasing only its second pole of the season after finishing 12 in FP3 but ultimately lost out to Red Bulls Max Verstappen in Q3 at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez. Verstappen beat Russell and Hamilton to pole by three tenths of a second as both Mercedes drivers struggled in their final Q3 runs. Russell called his last lap terrible after running wide at Turn 12 and failing to improve his time while Hamilton revealed after the session that he felt an engine issue in Q3. He qualified third five thousandths of a second off Russells time. Hamilton said it was generally a good qualifying session with no major issues but he felt the engine problem did cost him a bit of performance. We had some problem with the engine towards the end and in Q3 he said. So I definitely think there was performance left on the table. I did the best I could. Hamilton explained that the issue started to appear in Q2 and was then occurring on every run in Q3 basically dropping out of power on exits from corners. He added I do think we were losing quite a bit of time I think out of the last corner and basically out of most of the corners. It felt like an ignition issue. But Ill find out from the team. Toto Wolff Team Principal and CEO Mercedes AMG Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images Asked by Motorsport.com about the issue Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff said there was an oscillation that had been spotted on Hamiltons engine. That badly affects drivability said Wolff. So it definitely affected his lap. Hamiltons only valid time of Q3 was set on his final lap after his first effort earlier in the session was deleted due to exceeding track limits at Turn 2 setting a time that would have been onehundredth of a second slower than his second effect. Hamilton explained that losing the first lap made his second one very hard as he ensured he did not breach track limits again and risk setting no time at all which would have left him 10th. I had to be very reserved on that last lap just to make sure that it was clean because I was a tenth up to that point said Hamilton. Unfortunately I was not able to push as hard as Id have liked. Nevertheless I think its a good result for the team second and third. Its no bad position to start. I hope we can fix the problem on Sunday.
Alonso: We need to stop putting F1 fans against each other on social media, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/alonso-we-need-to-stop-putting-f1-fans-against-each-other-on-social-media/10392682/, In an interview with Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf that was published on Saturday twotime F1 world champion Alonso discussed former teammate Hamilton and current world champion Max Verstappen when reflecting on last years podium in Qatar. Alonso said he thought Verstappen had performed better than Hamilton last year and was a worthy champion in 2021 adding I also have a lot of respect for Lewis. Still it is different when you win seven world titles when you only had to fight with your teammate. Lets enjoy them.The quotes and tweet led to fierce discussion among fans on social media but Alonso said he wanted to try to help and make social media a better place by clearing up his comments. We need to stop putting the fans against each other., In an interview with Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf that was published on Saturday twotime F1 world champion Alonso discussed former teammate Hamilton and current world champion Max Verstappen when reflecting on last years podium in Qatar. Alonso said he thought Verstappen had performed better than Hamilton last year and was a worthy champion in 2021 adding I also have a lot of respect for Lewis. Still it is different when you win seven world titles when you only had to fight with your teammate. Then I think a championship has less value than when you have fewer titles but have had to fight against other drivers with equal or even better material. But after the quotes were picked up and started to circulate on more outlets stating that Alpine driver Alonso considered Verstappens championships to be more valuable than Hamiltons titles the Spaniard took to Twitter to clarify his comments. He wrote And again Please all the titles are amazing well deserved and inspiring. Incomparable to each other and lets enjoy champions and legends of our current time. Tired of the continuous search for headlines. Lets enjoy them. The quotes and tweet led to fierce discussion among fans on social media but Alonso said he wanted to try to help and make social media a better place by clearing up his comments. We need to all collaborate on that said Alonso. We need to stop putting the fans against each other. We are all in the same thing. Great champions great sportsmen and we try to enjoy this beautiful time. Alonso noted in the original interview that he did not fight against Renault teammate Giancarlo Fisichella for his titles in 2005 and 2006 nor did Verstappen battle against Sergio Perez or former teammate Alex Albon to win races. Fernando Alonso and Giancarlo Fisichella Renault celebrate in Parc Ferme Photo by Mark Sutton  Motorsport Images But Michael Schumacher in particular fought with his teammate Rubens Barrichello to become champion five times in a row and Hamilton with Nico Rosberg and Valtteri Bottas Alonso added. Thats different I think. But seemingly in response to Alonsos comments Hamilton posted a picture of them together on the podium from the 2007 United States Grand Prix when they were teammates at McLaren. The race saw Alonso fume at McLaren as he lost to Hamilton  then in his rookie season  amid an acrimonious season that ended with Alonso leaving after just a single year. Hamilton posted the picture of him standing on the top step of the podium with his hand on Alonsos shoulder simply with a thumbs up emoji. Additional reporting by Erwin Jaeggi

Max Verstappen Takes Mexico Grand Prix Pole Position, https://sports.ndtv.com/formula-1/max-verstappen-takes-mexico-grand-prix-pole-position-3473408, Twotime world champion Max Verstappen gave Red Bull reason to smile again on Saturday when he secured pole position for Sundays Mexico City Grand Prix with an authoritative late qualifying lap. Verstappen took control on his first run in Q3 and then trimmed his time to resist the threat from the muchimproved Mercedes team. The passion of the fans here is really incredible and in the stadium it is just amazing to drive there. The opening Q1 period saw Hamilton maintain Mercedes muchimproved form in the rarefied atmosphere at 2200 metres altitude by topping the times ahead of Verstappen and Leclerc. On his second run Verstappen regained third but was relegated a place by Sainz seizing second and splitting the silver arrows for Ferrari., Twotime world champion Max Verstappen gave Red Bull reason to smile again on Saturday when he secured pole position for Sundays Mexico City Grand Prix with an authoritative late qualifying lap. After 24 hours of arguments and derision following the announcement of Red Bulls penalty for breaching Formula Ones 145 million cost cap last year it was a sweet return to success with his sixth pole this year and the 17th of his career. The 25yearold Dutchman clocked a best lap of 1min 17.775sec to finish 0.304 seconds ahead of George Russell and his Mercedes teammate seventime champion Lewis Hamilton. Verstappen took control on his first run in Q3 and then trimmed his time to resist the threat from the muchimproved Mercedes team. He will be hunting a record 14th win in a single season on Sunday. That was a good qualifying the Dutchman said. It was a close one but we made a few adjustments to the car and got into a better rhythm so to be on pole here is of course amazing. Its a very long run down to Turn One here so we need a good start but I think we have a quick car and thats what is most important. The passion of the fans here is really incredible and in the stadium it is just amazing to drive there. His Red Bull teammate and local hero Sergio Perez was fourth ahead of Ferraris Carlos Sainz and a resurgent Valtteri Bottas of Alfa Romeo. Verstappen said he was sure Perez will be there in the fight tomorrow. Charles Leclerc who crashed heavily on Friday was seventh in the second Ferrari ahead of McLarens Lando Norris and the Alpines of twotime champion Fernando Alonso and Esteban Ocon. Russell was disappointed. Sorry sorry sorry he said on his team radio after running wide on his final lap. The team deserved more today. Theyve produced a really great car this weekend and it felt like our pole to have and I did a terrible lap at the end. Hamilton who had harboured hopes of doing better was philosophical. This is the best qualifying weve had all year. It just shows that perseverance and never giving up can pay off. Im quite happy with that position  its a along way to Turn One. The session came after many leading teams reacted negatively to Red Bulls 7 milliion fine and 10 percent reduction in permitted aerodynamic research for overspending last year. Ferrari said they were deeply unhappy and Mercedes said Christian Horners description of his teams punishment as draconian was an exaggeration while McLaren said it was not harsh enough.  Home hero Perez  All that was set aside when qualifying started at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez where the air temperature was 25 degrees Celsius and the track 49 near perfect conditions. The opening Q1 period saw Hamilton maintain Mercedes muchimproved form in the rarefied atmosphere at 2200 metres altitude by topping the times ahead of Verstappen and Leclerc. Fourtime champion Sebastian Vettel was among those eliminated. After a turbulent start to the season when they were beset by porpoising problems Mercedes had made steady progress and the RussellHamilton onetwo was their best session result of the year. Hamilton in 118.552 took command ahead of Russell by 0.013 seconds the pair heading Bottas and Verstappen on their first runs before Perez emerged alone to a roar from the sellout crowd. Checo Checo they chanted as he took third on a set of new soft tyres. On his second run Verstappen regained third but was relegated a place by Sainz seizing second and splitting the silver arrows for Ferrari. At the flag it was Daniel Ricciardo of McLaren Zhou Guayyu of Alfa Romeo Alpha Tauris Yuki Tsunoda and Pierre Gasly and Kevin Magnussen who missed out on the topten shootout. Promoted The top five were separated by less than onetenth of a second the top four by just 0.014 seconds  a clear signal of a close tussle for pole position to come as Perez went early into Q3. His 118.153 was swiftly beaten by Verstappen in 117.947 with a sensational lap that was unmatched on the first runs as Hamiltons best lap in 118.094 was deleted for exceeding track limits on the kerb at Turn Three.

The long run to Turn 1 Crucial to any drivers hopes of a good race is the start in Mexico City and weve often seen it impact matters at the front. Bottas between the Ferraris For another driver just having a quiet start appears to be the target with Valtteri Bottas finding himself on the third row., From Mercedes going for their first win of the year to the home favourite in the mix and from Valtteri Bottas threatening the frontrunners to the unique challenge of the circuits altitude we pick out some key areas to keep an eye on when the lights go out at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez 1. Can Mercedes finally win in 2022 It has been over a decade since Mercedes last endured a winless season in Formula 1 with 2011 the last time they failed to get at least one driver on the top step of the podium over the course of the year. They are in real danger of suffering the same fate this year but in Mexico City the team look as competitive as they have all season. READ MORE Verstappen fends off Mercedes pair for maiden Mexico City pole The challenge ahead of them is a clear one beat Max Verstappen. The double world champion spoiled Mercedes party on Saturday when he took pole position beating George Russell  who had been fastest in FP2 and FP3  and Lewis Hamilton who had topped Q1 and Q2. Verstappen has to be the favourite given his form and the pace of the Red Bull all year but this is certainly a circuit that has suited Mercedes because the high altitude means they suffer less from their high levels of drag even when keeping the cars high downforce level. Hamilton so nearly won in Austin and Mercedes showed they are getting closer to the front with an upgraded car so Mexico is probably their best chance to date. 2022 Mexico City GP Qualifying Max Verstappen seals pole position ahead of Mercedes pair 2. The long run to Turn 1 Crucial to any drivers hopes of a good race is the start in Mexico City and weve often seen it impact matters at the front. In each of the past four races the polesitter has failed to win the race and that is in no small part to the slipstream effect that leaves you vulnerable off the line. With the 2022 cars the tow has been reduced because the car in front is not punching the same type of hole in the air as in the past but it still has its benefits and with over 800 metres between pole position and the first braking zone there is plenty of opportunity for a following car to gain. READ MORE It was our pole to have says Russell as he and Hamilton rue Q3 mistakes in Mexico City While admitting its going to be difficult Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff says Starting second and third can be advantageous and I hope we can stick our nose or both noses into Turn 1 and then disappear into the distance. Russell and Hamilton wont be the only drivers aiming to make gains though as home hero Sergio Perez has a chance of making moves from fourth on the grid as he goes in search of what would be a massively popular victory among the passionate Mexican crowd. Could Mercedes pick up their first win of the year this weekend 3. Bottas between the Ferraris For another driver just having a quiet start appears to be the target with Valtteri Bottas finding himself on the third row. Bottas has seen his brilliant earlyseason form hit by a less competitive Alfa Romeo as the year has gone on but his onelap pace was clear to see as he was regularly near the top of the timing screens throughout qualifying. The Finn believed seventh place was the best he could target  behind the Red Bull Mercedes and Ferrari cars  but instead he managed to get the better of Charles Leclerc to secure sixth on the grid. READ MORE Its really uplifting for the whole team  Bottas revels in P6 performance at Mexico City qualifying Its a crucial time for Alfa Romeo too as they have seen their advantage in sixth place in the constructors championship whittled away by Aston Martin to the point they now sit just three points ahead Mike Kracks team. But with Sebastian Vettel starting from 16th place and Lance Stroll 20th theres a big opportunity for Bottas to earn them a little bit more breathing room. All smiles for Bottas who was in top form in qualifying 4. Alpine and McLaren resuming battle Its a similar story when it comes to Alpine and McLaren who appear to be intent on ensuring their fight for fourth overall goes down to the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi. Every time one team appears to have got the upper hand the other soon pegs them back and McLaren just chipped away at the Alpine advantage in Austin when Lando Norris overtook Fernando Alonso late on to close the gap to 11 points. FACTS AND STATS Verstappen starting P1 but no polesitter has finished on the podium here since 2016 Norris is again leading the way in the battle this weekend in Mexico starting from eighth ahead of Alonso in ninth and Esteban Ocon in tenth but Daniel Ricciardo is also right in the fight at this stage as well as he lines up directly behind the Alpine pair in 11th. Strategies are likely to come into play in a race where the Alpine straight line speed advantage is lessened and the French constructor could be the more nervous of the two teams when it comes to reliability having seen both cars retire in Singapore to provide McLaren with a big chance to close the gap a few races ago. The McLarenAlpine fight will continue here in Mexico
Ricciardo cops brutal miss but still lands best quali result in five races, https://www.foxsports.com.au/motorsport/formula-one/formula-1-2022-mexican-grand-prix-qualifying-results-times-blog-live-updates-stream-start-time-practice/news-story/83264ad786e849bf983e29b40888fc77, Daniel Ricciardo secured his best qualifying result in five races but narrowly missed out on an appearance in the third qualifying session for topten drivers at the Mexican Grand Prix.

I generally had a really good session today., Daniel Ricciardo secured his best qualifying result in five races but narrowly missed out on an appearance in the third qualifying session for topten drivers at the Mexican Grand Prix. It comes after the Australian opened up on the most challenging year ahead of qualifying. In an incredibly close and dramatic session Ricciardo made it out of Q1 for the first time in five races only to be dumped out as the 11thfastest driver in Q2 by just 0.053s.

New to Kayo Start your free trial now  But Max Verstappen already confirmed as the World Champion this season soared to pole ahead of the Mercedes duo George Russell and Lewis Hamilton. His 1m 17.775s left Russell second by 0.304s  after he had his final run rubbed off for exceeding track limits  and Hamilton a marginal 0.005s off in P3. Verstappen took control on his first run in Q3 and then trimmed his time to resist the threat from the muchimproved Mercedes team. He will be hunting a record 14th win in a single season on Sunday. That was a good qualifying the Dutchman said. It was a close one but we made a few adjustments to the car and got into a better rhythm so to be on pole here is of course amazing. Its a very long run down to Turn One here so we need a good start but I think we have a quick car and thats what is most important. The passion of the fans here is really incredible and in the stadium it is just amazing to drive there. Sergio Perez was fourth in the other Red Bull for his home Grand Prix. Ricciardo finished the third and final practice session in P14 the same result as the second practice session as the Australians struggles at McLaren continued. But he found pace in qualifying and will be disappointed not to have reached Q3 as one of the top 10 drivers. Audi get partner for 2026 F1 play  0027 It has been a tough year for Ricciardo who admitted in an interview with The Daily Mail ahead of this weeks race that he was not his normal bubbly self as results slipped. My confidence was being eaten away driving a car that wouldnt dance with me and would bite back Ricciardo said. Whenever we thought we found a solution along would come another set of challenges. When you put so much into something and it doesnt work out there is sadness. It gets to you. Last year it affected me a little bit too much. I wouldnt be my usual bubbly self. I would be reluctant if someone said lets go out for dinner. I would need some cajoling. I let it get to me. I started to speak to a psychologist last year the most challenging year I have had. Ricciardo will have a fresh start next year with the Australian expected to take up a reserve driver role either at Mercedes or Red Bull. It comes after McLarens decision to axe Ricciardo earlier this year something which the 33yearold admits came as a surprise. It is fair to say it was unexpected given I was on a threeyear deal that had a year to run he said. It is not something you can prepare for. But Id already had some honest discussions with Andreas Seidel team principal and Zak Brown chief executive earlier in the year to see what we could do to improve things. It was a concern on both sides. Qualifying disappointment for Ricciardo  0124 In other news having set the pace with a leading time of 1.19.970 Mercedes George Russell is hoping he and teammate Lewis Hamilton can continue their success in qualifying. Id like to think its definitely a podium thats possible at least. Its probably one of if not our best Friday of the year Russell told the Formula 1s official website when asked of his expectations for the weekend. Between the two of us Russell and team mate Lewis Hamilton weve got 14 podiums so far this season so thats absolutely what well be going for. But not having the normal FP2 running where you get to understand the long run the consecutive laps of your rivals its going to be difficult to know. Hamilton finished the day in fourth and having settled for second place at the United States Grand Prix he too is also keen to potentially shoot for top spot this weekend. I feel good I feel really really good he said. I generally had a really good session today. I really enjoyed driving around the track. The car is feeling better and better as we work more through it and we understand it more. George Russell is pretty confident. Photo by Jared C.

Leclerc though did not seem too worried about the damage impacting his chances ahead of qualifying and Monday mornings race. I dont think any of it will compromise us he said. I think we have enough parts now with all the penalties weve had in the past so it should be fine. Follow all the action with the live blog below Cant see it Click here

Qualifying Highlights 2022 Mexico City Grand Prix Q1  Hamilton fastest over Verstappen Though there was a 60 risk of rain for qualifying temperatures were high and the clouds were scattered above Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez in Q1. Williams and Haas  whose driver Magnussen has a fiveplace grid penalty having taken his sixth engine  began their runs first the rest of the field waiting a minute or two to hit the track. Verstappens first run was compromised by oversteer into Turns 1 and 2 but he set the early benchmark with a time of 1m 19.222s fastest in Sector 3 to go 0.283s faster than Leclerc who was another 0.018s faster than Bottas  the Finn in turn 0.004s faster than Hamilton who lost time in Sector 3. In the provisional drop zone was Schumacher in 16th leading Albon then Vettel Magnussen and Latifi. Schumacher improved with three minutes left but his lap was chalked off for track limits at Turn 2. There was plenty of margin left on the table but neither Ferrari emerged for a final run while Verstappen and Perez  who had to set a second flying lap with four minutes remaining  also declined another go. Hamilton shot to the top thereafter bumping Verstappen to second by 0.053s while Leclerc ended up third ahead of Bottas. Sainz rounded out the top five ahead of Russell and Perez settled for seventh almost half a second off his team mate. Hamiltons final run saw him go top in Q1 With a big hit of the kerbs at Turn 10 Norris took eighth Tsunoda ninth and then Ocon rounded out the top 10 ahead of Alpine team mate Alonso. Gasly Ricciardo Zhou and Magnussen made it to Q2  but Schumacher missed out on his 15thplace team mate by 0.126s. Vettel set the same time as Schumacher just later than his compatriot for 17th while Aston Martin team mate Stroll  who has a threeplace penalty for his Austin collision with Alonso  took 18th.

With a time of 1m 18.552s Hamilton set the fastest time early on with Russell  who relayed on the radio that he was worried about his brakes  0.013s behind and Bottas another twotenths off in P3. Verstappen meanwhile was 0.382s off the pace with his first run taking P4 ahead of Ocon. A huge tow on the front straight saw Leclerc begin his lap with an advantage but he lost time in Sector 2 and ended up 0.557s off the pace in P6. With three minutes left Perez  who was sitting 12th  once again emerged on a clear track and this time he found more than a second. Ricciardo Tsunoda Zhou Gasly and Magnussen were in the drop zone but the final runs were incoming. Hamilton retained top spot but Sainz improved to go 0.008s off the Mercedes Russell keeping third as he suffered a frontright lockup on his final run and Verstappen going 0.001s behind the Briton in P4 leaving Perez fifth  just 0.063s off the pace.

Perez began the shootout packedout Foro Sol grandstands emitting a goosebumpinducing roar for their home driver as he set a time of 1m 18.153s. Perez would drop down to third after Verstappen eclipsed him by twotenths Russell going a provisional second by 0.132s and Hamilton P3 by 0.147s  before track limits at Turn 3 cost him that flying lap. Worries compounded for Hamilton as he reported drivability issues soon after. Sainz then Bottas rounded out the top five.

Verstappen meanwhile improved to a 1m 17.775s and Russell had his final time chalked off to finish 0.304s off the champions pace. Hamilton couldnt sweep the sessions and for the 11thstraight year there would be a different polesitter at the Mexican Grand Prix Verstappens time would not be toppled. Later admitting his final effort was a terrible lap Russell ended up second on the grid however and Hamilton third  just 0.005s off his team mate. Bottas starred throughout qualifying Perez settled for fourth but was backed to recover by his team mate as the crowd cheered for the Mexican long after the chequered flag flew while Sainz rounded out the top five more than half a second off the pace. Bottas took P6 to split the Ferraris in a stunning performance for Alfa Romeo while Leclerc settled for seventh 0.780s off pole. That left Norris in eighth with Alpines Alonso ninth and Ocon rounding out the top 10. Verstappen now holds the advantage but not since 2016 has the polesitter won in Mexico City.

Leclerc did improve but not by enough to trouble the top positions which left the focus on the Mercedes drivers after Verstappen then flashed through to improve the best time to a 1m17.775s. Daniel Ricciardo was the highestplaced faller in Q2  the Australian the only driver not to set a personal best on their final flier missing out behind Alonso in the middle segment by just 0.053s. In Q1 Zhous lastgasp improvement knocked out Mick Schumacher  the Haas driver losing his penultimate lap that would have easily been fast enough to get through for cutting the kerbs at Turn 2. Sebastian Vettel ended 17th but behind Schumacher because the younger German driver set his identical 1m20.491s first with Lance Stroll just behind in the other Aston Martin., Home hero Sergio Perez took fourth while Alfa Romeos Valtteri Bottas was a surprise star of qualifying to split the Ferrari drivers and secure sixth on the grid for Sundays race at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez. After Hamilton topped Q1 and Q2 he lost his opening time in Q3 for cutting Turn 3 with Verstappen leading at the head of the times after those first runs in the final segment  his 1m17.947s breaking into the 1m17s bracket for the first time all session. Perez like he had in the first runs led the pack around for the final fliers and he improved with his last go but not by enough to topple his teammate nor Russell who trailed by 0.132 seconds after the opening attempts.

Leclerc did improve but not by enough to trouble the top positions which left the focus on the Mercedes drivers after Verstappen then flashed through to improve the best time to a 1m17.775s. That became the pole lap when Hamilton finally registered a Q3 time that was 0.309s behind Verstappens new best and still not quicker than Russell who lost his final time for sliding off track beyond the Turn 12 exit kerbs entering the stadium but had done enough already to secure second. Valtteri Bottas Alfa Romeo C42 Photo by Mark Sutton  Motorsport Images While the focus was on the frontrunners Bottas slipped in a 1m18.401s having been in the top six in both Q1 and Q2 in a strong showing for Alfa. Behind Leclerc came Lando Norris and Fernando Alonso who completed just a single run in Q3 during the lull between the two efforts completed by all the rest with Esteban Ocon rounding out the top 10 in the other Alpine. Daniel Ricciardo was the highestplaced faller in Q2  the Australian the only driver not to set a personal best on their final flier missing out behind Alonso in the middle segment by just 0.053s. Behind Ricciardo came Zhou Guanyu then the AlphaTauri pair of Yuki Tsunoda and Pierre Gasly  both frustrated by their lack of grip and the latter particularly annoyed to end up out after completing a clean final run. The final driver eliminated in Q2 was Kevin Magnussen who will drop five places on the grid for Sundays race for Haas having to fit a sixth internal combustion engine of the year to his car after it ground to a halt during FP1 with Pietro Fittipaldi aboard. In Q1 Zhous lastgasp improvement knocked out Mick Schumacher  the Haas driver losing his penultimate lap that would have easily been fast enough to get through for cutting the kerbs at Turn 2. Although Schumacher who ended up just behind his gridpenaltyaddled teammate at the end of Q1 set a personal best on his final flier it was 0.8s slower than his deleted previous time and left him vulnerable as the final laps in the opening segment were completed. Sebastian Vettel ended 17th but behind Schumacher because the younger German driver set his identical 1m20.491s first with Lance Stroll just behind in the other Aston Martin. The Williams pair of Alex Albon and Nicholas Latifi brought up the rear of the field with the former the only driver knocked out in Q1 not to set a personal best on his final lap  thanks to an offtrack moment at Turn 8 having had to catch a rear axle slide in the preceding corner.

Mexican Grand Prix Hamilton plays down Mexico GP boos after coming so close to first win of season 30102022 AT 2246 Horner has claimed it will cost Red Bull between 0.25 and 0.5 seconds. The scale of that penalty isnt much more than what you would lose if you were just one place higher up in the championship Mercedes head of trackside engineering Andrew Shovlin told the press. I think describing it as draconian is an exaggeration. Reducing the number of runs does limit your freedom when youre developing your concept but were in reasonably wellexplored regulations now. But you definitely have to be more efficient about it. If it were half a second which Ive heard mentioned then the team at the back of the grid would have a threeseconds advantage to one at the front and that simply isnt the case. But it depends on how well you make decisions during the year. I would have thought a tenth or a bit more than a tenth maybe twotenths is realistically what that will cost you. McLaren team principal Andreas Seidl has also expressed his displeasure at the penalty stating that Red Bull should stop telling fairytales. Ferrari racing director Laurent Mekies feels the punishment is on the lenient side and was particularly unhappy that the 6.07m fine is separate to Red Bulls budget cap spend. We certainly think its low said Mekies. We dont see it on the same scale as to be able to compensate the overspending that was done. Especially combined with the fact that the penalty is not combined with any budget cap reductions for them. So we say altogether what will remain of the real impact of the penalty will probably be very small.

FIA will not deem F1 cars that lose mirrors unsafe after all, https://the-race.com/formula-1/fia-will-not-deem-f1-cars-that-lose-mirrors-unsafe-after-all/, The FIA will not deem Formula 1 cars unsafe if they lose a wing mirror or take action against teams in such circumstances despite the original penalty applied to Fernando Alonso last week. Alonso lost seventh place in the United States Grand Prix after Haas successfully protested his car for being raced in an unsafe condition. Alonso gets US GP seventh place back as penalty overturned Read moreThis was because the Alpine had been driven with its right wing mirror flapping after an airborne crash until the mirror broke off completely. Ahead of the Mexican Grand Prix though the FIA has held talks with the teams and appears to have been convinced that this should not be considered unsafe. They are optimistic that minor damage will be accepted while continuing to assess damaged cars and then apply the blackandorange flag if required., The FIA will not deem Formula 1 cars unsafe if they lose a wing mirror or take action against teams in such circumstances despite the original penalty applied to Fernando Alonso last week. Alonso lost seventh place in the United States Grand Prix after Haas successfully protested his car for being raced in an unsafe condition. Alonso gets US GP seventh place back as penalty overturned Read more This was because the Alpine had been driven with its right wing mirror flapping after an airborne crash until the mirror broke off completely. When the stewards made their judgement they cited FIA technical delegate Jo Bauer calling a flapping mirror unsafe and that the car was unsafe to be driven with a mirror missing while the FIAs head of singleseater matters Nikolas Tombazis was said to have agreed that the car was not safe in that condition. Alonsos penalty was eventually overturned as after an initially unsuccessful protest of its own Alpine successfully petitioned a review of the Haas protest and the stewards said it should not have been admitted as it missed a deadline to be filed. However this was effectively a technicality and the original stewards decision appeared to stand  indicating that in the future cars with broken mirrors would either need to retire or pit until they could be fully repaired. Ahead of the Mexican Grand Prix though the FIA has held talks with the teams and appears to have been convinced that this should not be considered unsafe. The original Haas protest against Alpine was triggered by frustration with inconsistent application of the blackandorange flag as Haas felt it had been unfairly forced to pit in three races this year for minor front wing endplate whereas Alonso  and Red Bulls Sergio Perez  were able to race on in the United States Grand Prix with damage. Teams have been told that the FIA will be more selective with the use of that flag and The Race understands that after discussions it has been agreed that damage like the front wing endplate or indeed the mirror does not meet the threshold to be a safety concern. The failings exposed yet again in FIAs F1 penalty Uturn Read more Alpine sporting director Alan Permane said there had been very positive discussions with the FIA technical department and that they agreed things have gone too far. From here onwards small damages like the mirror like the front wing endplate if its nonstructural like a brake duct  something like that will not be considered to be a black and orange flag offence said Permane. This is still ongoing and Im sure at the technical advisory committee and the sporting advisory committee well discuss it more but a line in the sand has been drawn. This means while Haas ultimately lost its protest it has succeeded in forcing a reckoning on what constitutes an unsafe car. Asked by The Race about the difference between the new position and what the stewards reported from the FIA officials in Austin Permane said I dont want to speak for Jo or Nikolas but what our discussion yesterday was and weve had some texts from them this morning specifically saying the loss of a mirror wouldnt be considered a black and orange flag. I think if we adopt these guidelines from Mexico onwards weve got a sensible place. Gary Anderson F1 should have more penalties like Alonsos Read more Other teams have indicated that the talks since Austin have provided clarity on the matter. They are optimistic that minor damage will be accepted while continuing to assess damaged cars and then apply the blackandorange flag if required. Ferraris sporting director Laurent Mekies said What matters is that we have an understanding of what is and isnt OK. We move on with that understanding and we can have a consistent application of the regulations and everybody knows what the limit is. Hopefully its a clearer situation which has been defined yesterday which is good news. The overarching element is for the FIA for whenever they see something unsafe still dont want to have parts flying off the car and hitting somebody else we are sure they will keep their finger on the button in that case to keep us at bay. Mercedes trackside engineering director Andrew Shovlin said We dont want black and orange flags every race because weve survived a lot of years where they were used correctly and infrequently and we do need to just let the drivers get on with driving and not be too afraid of getting near another car.

Verstappen expects “a lot of crashes” when F1 ditches tyre blankets, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/verstappen-expects-a-lot-of-crashes-when-f1-ditches-tyre-blankets/10391253/, Of course I also had the hardest compound but I think theres a lot more to it. If we have the tyre blankets anyway why dont we just use them to the fullest because theyre there Max Verstappen Red Bull Racing talks to the press Photo by Mark Sutton  Motorsport ImagesYou either go just full blankets or zero not middle way because we have them already. I think were going to have a lot of crashes. Your tyre pressures are going to go through the roof so your tyres are going to degrade a lot more., F1 has been toying with the idea of outlawing tyre blankets since the switch to 18 inch wheels was finalised with that originally set to go ahead in 2021 before the COVID19 pandemic forced the new car regulations to be delayed until 2022. The series had already elected against a complete tyre blanket ban for 2021 back in 2019 with the phasing out of the warmers taking place gradually. Teams are currently permitted to a maximum tyre warmer temperature of 70 degrees Celsius this year down from 100 last year with that maximum level dropping to 50 in 2023 before a full ban in 2024. Two 2023 Pirelli tyre tests have taken place in the FP2 sessions at the United States and Mexican GPs when teams ran to the 50degree setting which Verstappen said was not enjoyable. Asked ahead of this weekends Mexican Grand Prix what his thoughts are on the incoming tyre blanket ban in 2024 the Red Bull driver expects the rule change to cause chaos on track. Yes it was not enjoyable Verstappen said of the Austin tyre test. I drove on tyres that were warmed to 50 degrees I think it was and I almost spun in the pitlane already. Of course I also had the hardest compound but I think theres a lot more to it. If we have the tyre blankets anyway why dont we just use them to the fullest because theyre there Max Verstappen Red Bull Racing talks to the press Photo by Mark Sutton  Motorsport Images You either go just full blankets or zero not middle way because we have them already. We dont need to buy new ones. I think were going to have a lot of crashes. That I know already compared to what we have at the moment. But yeah its tough. Also your tyre degradation is going to be completely different because your tyres are very cold. You are sliding around a lot in the first few laps. Your tyre pressures are going to go through the roof so your tyres are going to degrade a lot more. At the moment I dont really enjoy it but a lot of drivers say the same and we have to find a solution to that. Austin is still a track where you can easily switch on the tyres because of the high speed cornering. But if you go to like a track like a street circuit or Monaco can imagine you on like halfhalf conditions. I think is going to take like half of the race before you have like temperature on your tyres. Verstappen also hit back at suggestions outlawing tyre blankets could make the overcut pitstop strategy in races more powerful as is the case in GT racing. You have a lot less power in a GT car the Red Bull driver added. I think with these F1 cars they are very heavy as well. I mean Ive tried it and its just really almost impossible to drive. And I also drive still in my private time. I drive a GT3 car with no tyre blankets but these cars are a lot more forgiving and its a lot easier to manage than these kind of F1 cars because if you go on power a little bit too much with the power you have from the engine it can be a big big crash.

Ahead of the Mexican Grand Prix the 33yearold West Aussie opened up about the mental turmoil he has endured while failing to find form at McLaren where he has been dropped for 2023 and talks of how revealed he now needs a break from the sport next year to rebuild himself. Ricciardo who will be replaced at McLaren by countryman Oscar Piastri next season said last years trying circumstances and poor results had forced him to retreat into his shell. My confidence was being eaten away driving a car that wouldnt dance with me and would bite back Ricciardo said. Whenever we thought we found a solution along would come another set of challenges. When you put so much into something and it doesnt work out there is sadness. It gets to you. Last year it affected me a little bit too much. I wouldnt be my usual bubbly self. I would be reluctant if someone said lets go out for dinner. I would need some cajoling. I let it get to me. I started to speak to a psychologist last year  the most challenging year I have had. Racing is very much resultsdriven and dictates your Sunday happiness. I was neglecting friendships and thought it would be good to talk to someone to make sure the two sides of my life didnt cross over. Its like all things you need perspective. And with the calendar being so long it was hard to remove yourself from what was happening in the racing.

It is fair to say it was unexpected given I was on a threeyear deal that had a year to run he said. It is not something you can prepare for. But Id already had some honest discussions with Andreas Seidel team principal and Zak Brown chief executive earlier in the year to see what we could do to improve things. It was a concern on both sides. I didnt want to keep coming 14th or 15th. I kept the faith that something would click. But it hadnt happened by midseason and they took the decision they did. It put me in a tough position of thinking what next Ricciardo said he was looking forward to the chance to come back in 2024 with a spring in my step after what looms as a hiatus year next season.

But as time has gone on it has become clearer I do want a little distance from the sport though I do want to stay in touch. Its about getting enough space to rebuild myself. I dont want to get too deep. I am not on a voyage of selfdiscovery. But taking some time off going on some journeys and adventures will help. Ricciardo has welcomed plenty of support starting with Heidi Berger left his girlfriend of three years. She is the daughter of former Formula One driver Gerhard Berger. Some of the older drivers were helpful when McLaren decided I was going and made kind comments privately or publicly he said. Sebastian Vettel was outstanding. We had a lot of chats oneonone. Lewis Hamilton was good too.

Sky Sports News F1 reporter Craig Slater explains the extent of Red Bulls punishment after accepting a breach of the cost cap rules. Red Bull have been handed a 7 million fine and restrictions on car development time for breaching last seasons Formula 1 cost cap. Following over two weeks of speculation and criticism from rivals after a minor breach of the 145m limit in Max Verstappens maiden titlewinning campaign Red Bull were given their punishments on Friday at the Mexico City GP after reaching an accepted breach agreement ABA with the FIA. The ABA meant Red Bull had to admit their wrongdoing  with the team 2.2m over the cap after inaccurately excluding or adjusting a number of costs  but crucially brought with it an end to an F1 saga and less severe punishments. The FIA acknowledged if a tax credit had been correctly applied Red Bull would have only been 0.5m over. There is no accusation or evidence that Red Bull has sought at any time to act in bad faith dishonestly or in a fraudulent manner nor has it wilfully concealed any information from the Cost Cap Administration read an FIA statement. Red Bull have received both a financial and a minor sporting penalty with a 10 per cent reduction in wind tunnel time over the next 12 months most damaging.

Christian Horner claims that for Red Bull to be accused of fraudulent activity is shocking as he responds to Zak Browns letter. Red Bull were already set to have less time in their wind tunnel  where F1 teams test and perfect aerodynamics on their car  than their rivals due to winning this years constructors championship which they wrapped up last weekend in the USA to follow up Verstappens second drivers title. There is a sliding scale of wind tunnel runs in F1 depending on where a team finishes. With their penalty Red Bull are set to have 25 runs in their wind tunnel next season instead of 28. Ferrari by reference will have 30 runs if they finish second in the championship and Mercedes 32 should they end up third as expected. The constructor in last place has 46 runs. Sky Sports F1 pundit Martin Brundle however said earlier this week that Red Bull could be hit with a 25 per cent reduction in wind tunnel time so some may believe they have got away lightly. The 7m fine is not a reduction in their budget cap for next year which is 135m. Aston Martin meanwhile were also given their punishment on Friday for their procedural breach. The team have been handed a 450000 fine for failing to file accurate full year reporting documentation in respect of 2021. Williams took a fine for a similar breach earlier this year. How did Red Bull go over the limit Red Bull were first accused of a minor breach  an overspend of less than five per cent 7.25m  of F1s newfor2021 cost cap on October 10 and had been in discussions with the FIA since that revelation. The team  amid cheating accusations from McLaren boss Zak Brown and fierce criticism from other rivals  have protested their innocence throughout. Red Bull drivers Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez left and right and team boss Christian Horner 1.7m of their 2.2m overspend has been revealed to be owing to tax issues. It has now been confirmed by the FIA that Red Bull made errors on budget cap costs such as catering social security contributions apprenticeship levies unused spare parts for the car and charging certain costs to Red Bull Power Trains. The FIA pursued an ABA first as per the financial regulations and Red Bull effectively entering a plea bargain ruled out the more severe punishments for a minor breach such as points deductions or a reduction of future caps. In already hugely controversial circumstances Verstappen only beat Lewis Hamilton by eight points for last years drivers crown.

Christian Horner denies that Red Bull have gained any advantage from any cost cap breach and believes the relevant costs are within the cap. If Red Bull had rejected the FIAs terms the case would have gone to the cost cap adjudication panel and the full range of penalties would have been back on the table. After that it could have even escalated to the International Court of Appeals a dragging out of the scandal no one wanted. Analysis Red Bull still feel this is a tough sanction Sky Sports News Craig Slater This is Red Bull saying We accept we are in error we overspent and the FIA have delivered the sanction. Its less of a sanction than a lot of people have been talking about. The wind tunnel reduction of 10 per cent is a lot less than a lot of people were speculating it could have been 25 per cent. My understanding from some soundings within the team is that Red Bull still feel this is quite a tough sanction given they were only slightly over the cap. In the runup to all of this there has been some quite strong words exchanged behind the leading teams  we had Toto Wolff Ferrari and then Zak Brown weighing in on this. In a leaked letter Brown equated breaking the cost cap with cheating. But the FIA statement addresses talk of cheating by saying There is no accusation or evidence that RBR has sought at any time to act in bad faith dishonestly or in a fraudulent manner nor has it concealed wilfully any information from the cost cap administration. And that has been pretty consistent throughout as far as the FIA is concerned. Lets see what the other teams make of this. They cannot appeal this but it wont stop them talking about it.

Regarding the Red Bull penalties Wolff added I think any reduction in windtunnel time is going to be detrimental. Wolff agreed that todays outcome will serve as a suitable deterrent for other teams and help to ensure that the cost cap will be respected in future. Toto Wolff Team Principal and CEO Mercedes AMG Photo by Simon Galloway  Motorsport ImagesAsked for his thoughts on Christian Horners explanation of why Red Bull was over the cap Wolff said Nine teams complied with the regulations and stayed below the cap. Wolff praised the FIA for overseeing the cost cap process and ensuring that Red Bull received a stiff penalty suggesting that the outcome showed that nothing was brushed under the carpet., It was announced today that Red Bull had signed an Accepted Breach Agreement with the governing body. As a result it has been docked 10 of its aero testing for 12 months from now and fined 7 million. I think as for any penalty for us its too little Wolff told Autosport. For them it will be too much. Regarding the Red Bull penalties Wolff added I think any reduction in windtunnel time is going to be detrimental. How detrimental is difficult to judge at this stage. I think in absolute terms 7m is a lot of money. But maybe in the bigger scheme of things for Red Bull considering the investment they do on the power unit side and on the team its not. Wolff agreed that todays outcome will serve as a suitable deterrent for other teams and help to ensure that the cost cap will be respected in future. I think that the sum of the penalties is a deterrent the sporting penalty and to a lesser degree the financial fine. But reputational damage that is happening is probably the biggest thing and no team will want to come anywhere near that because obviously we are living in a transparent and compliant world. Our shareholders or our partners demand compliance and in that respect thats just not on anymore. Toto Wolff Team Principal and CEO Mercedes AMG Photo by Simon Galloway  Motorsport Images Asked for his thoughts on Christian Horners explanation of why Red Bull was over the cap Wolff said Nine teams complied with the regulations and stayed below the cap. This is a sport of marginal gains and everything else is just chatter. Theres no mitigating factor. Wolff praised the FIA for overseeing the cost cap process and ensuring that Red Bull received a stiff penalty suggesting that the outcome showed that nothing was brushed under the carpet. What I take as a positive is the strong governance he added. Nothing was brushed under the carpet. The FIA stood by the process. And I think that although the administration has only been in place for 10 months its very encouraging to see things executed. Thats the really positive of the process. Mohammed Ben Sulayem with a strong group of individuals Federico Lodi head of financial regs Shaila Ann Rao interim secretary general for sport and Nikolas Tombazis singleseater technical head ensured that the assessment and the policing of the cost cap was robust. And that is what I take as a positive out of the whole process. What we need to tidy up is the minor and major breaches. I think a breach is a breach. And thats how it should be handled.
Aussie Formula 1 prodigy Jack Doohan laments loss of Daniel Ricciardo for 2023 season, https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/f1/aussie-formula-1-prodigy-jack-doohan-laments-loss-of-daniel-ricciardo-for-2023-season-c-8695234, Daniel Ricciardos McLaren exit may have offered another young Aussie speed demon a golden Formula 1 opportunity but another rising racing prodigy has lamented the loss of one of the sports role models. By the time Ricciardo attempts to make a return to the grid in 2024 there may well be three Aussies in the field after Jack Doohan continued his remarkable rise through the ranks.

By the time Ricciardo attempts to make a return to the grid in 2024 there may well be three Aussies in the field after Jack Doohan continued his remarkable rise through the ranks. The 19yearold made his practice debut in Mexico behind the wheel for Alpine where he is an Academy driver on Saturday morning. Son of fivetime legendary MotoGP champion Mick Doohan slotted into Esteban Ocons seat for the opening practice session of the Mexico City Grand Prix as the paddock took a gander at the rising stars of racing. Doohan recorded the 19th fastest time and put himself in a prime position to take the reserve driver spot previously occupied by fellow countryman Oscar Piastri. Doohans rise through the ranks has been inspired by legends such as his father and Michael Schumacher who kickstarted his karting career but he also told Sky Sports he was disappointed Ricciardo did not have a seat for next season. Theres a lot of sadness for Daniel. Hes been the sole Australian on the grid for many years now since Mark left he said. A lot of people are devastated. Theyre really behind Daniel his character inside and outside the car and the enthusiasm he brings to the paddock and the fans is really good for our sport. Hopefully Ricciardos time off is for the right reasons and he can come back in a year or two and it will be for the better. Doohan revealed he attempted to follow in his fathers footsteps but a broken leg convinced him to stick to four wheels.

Credit Chris Graythen  Getty Images I broke my leg when I was five riding bikes  I think that scared me Doohan said. So I kind of stepped aside from the bike and went towards four wheels for a couple of years because one of my buddies was driving a kart. Id had a kart luckily gifted to me by Michael Schumacher because he and dad were quite close friends they were neighbours in Monaco. He came one time to our home in Australia and we had a kart track there so he gifted myself and my sister a gokart for I think  my third birthday it was quite cool. Once I was seven I got back on the four wheels and Im quite thankful for it obviously because Im way too big and wide to be on two wheels. Ricciardos practice sessions continued the disappointing trend of the season finishing 11th fastest in FP1 fifth slowest of the regular drivers. FP2 was not much better with both McLarens outside the top 12.
Alpine’s protest regarding Alonso penalty ruled inadmissible, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.alpines-protest-regarding-alonso-penalty-ruled-inadmissible.513rj0hWXR5ZqlAUHFrCo5.html, The FIA Stewards have ruled that Alpines protest over Haass postrace dispute in Austin is not admissible  but the French manufacturers have requested a right of review over the case. On Sunday night in the United States Haas lodged a protest on the grounds that Alonso and Sergio Perezs cars were in an unsafe condition after separate incidents for those drivers. Perez was not sanctioned but Alonso was given a 30second postrace penalty in Austin as his car was not deemed to be in a safe condition after he had collided with Lance Stroll. The twotime champion was therefore demoted from seventh to 15th. Alpine then disputed Haass protests on the grounds that they had been lodged too late  24 minutes past the specified deadline  but the FIA concluded in Mexico City that there is no ability or right for any party to protest a decision of the Stewards nor against a summons to a hearing., The FIA Stewards have ruled that Alpines protest over Haass postrace dispute in Austin is not admissible  but the French manufacturers have requested a right of review over the case.

Mercedes have endured a hugelydisappointing campaign following the introduction of new design regulations and saw their eightyear streak of constructors championships officially ended on Sunday as Red Bull added the title to Max Verstappens second successive drivers crown. After an encouraging display in Austin whether or not Mercedes can win one of the final three races  starting in Mexico this weekend  has been a hot topic of discussion but the seventime world champion is not confident. Hamilton pointed to the fact that his strong race performance was aided by being boosted to third on the grid because of penalties for Ferraris Charles Leclerc and Red Bulls Sergio Perez. I think we really need to be realistic Hamilton said. The Red Bull car has been the fastest car by far all year and it is still the fastest car.

It was great to start third and be in a position to fight but on true pace they were ahead of us today and they will be the next three races.

Hamilton is aiming to break the tie with Michael Schumacher in his 16th campaign this year. His hopes of victory in Austin were further boosted when Verstappen was held stationary for 11 seconds during his second and final pit stop which saw the Red Bull driver drop around seven seconds behind the Brit with Leclerc also between them.

The porpoising the breaking the floors because they were hitting the ground and to figure that out during the year when you also have very limited testing was super difficult. Also to do it within the budget cap such a big challenge and theyve really made great progress.

I have not a put a limit on it to be honest he said on Thursday when asked how long he would stay in F1. There are a lot of great things that are being put in place like I just launched the production company this week but I feel great in my body and mind. So I think Im just in a happy place in my life a lot more grounded. So its just a lot better setup allround and I feel like I can take the team to more championships., MEXICO CITY  Lewis Hamilton is planning to stay on the Formula One grid until at least 2025 after opening talks with Mercedes about a contract extension. Hamiltons current deal is due to expire at the end of next season but he has made clear that he has no plans to retire at the end of 2023. Instead the seventime world champion is looking to sign a new multiyear deal which would keep him in Formula One until at least 2025 and possibly beyond. I have not a put a limit on it to be honest he said on Thursday when asked how long he would stay in F1. Im planning to do a multiyear deal with my team. I really dont know what the next five years ... I think were still trying to work on that. There are a lot of great things that are being put in place like I just launched the production company this week but I feel great in my body and mind. So I want to continue I think theres more stuff for us to achieve together so I want to be here longer I just dont know. If Fernando leaves maybe Ill have to think about it twice because Ill be the oldest driver then Hamilton now 37 previously said he had no plans to race into his 40s but now points to various projects outside of F1 including his charitable foundation Mission 44 as added impetus for staying in the sport. Its been lingering around this narrative of me winding towards the end of my career he added. Im sure for all of you in your careers and your jobs you probably have to analyze whats next Is there someone else you want to go Is there somewhere higher you want to be Is there room for growth in that role I think that was perhaps something for me. Being a racing driver is a great thing but I was trying to see How am I going to grow beyond this role And I think youre seeing that with the work were doing with Ignite Ive got Mission 44 now Toto Wolff has been a great leader and enabled me to do things. He said to me in the past when Niki Lauda would say to him How do you let him do this and then eventually theyre all coming round to the idea that supporting and enabling people to be their best is better for everybodys interest. So I think Im just in a happy place in my life a lot more grounded. Ive got my home that I get to spend time in in the UK when I come to see the team for example and the family come down. So its just a lot better setup allround and I feel like I can take the team to more championships.

The Constructors Cup was clinched by Verstappens Red Bull Racing team at Circuit of the Americas outside Austin Texas this past weekend. Now comes Sundays Mexican Grand Prix and it seems theres not much left to race for except bragging rights. Well actually theres a lot left to race for at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez such as can Charles Leclerc and Ferrari salvage some pride and finish second in the driver standings or can Sergio Perez make it a Red Bull 12 on the season. Perez is out to become the first home driver to win the Mexican Grand Prix while his illustrious teammate is also in search of his 14th win on the season which no F1 driver has ever accomplished Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel hold the record at 13. Obviously a win at his home Grand Prix would go a long way for Perez  known as Checo to his friends and fans  clinching the first runnerup position to Verstappen. Leclerc currently holds a twopoint advantage on Perez. And while it is a case of too little too late the upgrades Mercedes unleashed at the COTA made them very racy indeed so expect Lewis Hamilton and teammate George Russell to not go quietly into the night in these final three races of the calendar.

It is by far the highest elevation the F1 circus will compete at on the 2022 calendar year Interlagos Brazil is the next highest at 4921 feet and as can be imagined the thin air causes issues for not just the drivers but also the cars. It should be a track the Ferraris excel at considering the thinner air means that cars carrying more downforce will suffer less of a penalty and cars with a horsepower advantage may find it harder to breath in that thin air. The signature feature of the track is Turn 17 the Peraltada a banked extremely fast corner that brings the field back to the extremely long front straight. This is also the second of the two DRS zones on the track setting up for dragrace finishes to Turn 1. The first DRS zone is at the exit of the Turn 11 chicane to Turn 12 which is very short. Strategies in the past have seen a onestopper be the winning formula with cars starting on the hardest compound being good 50 laps or more then switching to a softer compound for the sprint to the finish. Whether that compound will be the intermediate or the super soft remains to be discovered by the teams during open practices on Friday and Saturday ahead of Saturdays qualifying. Past races has seen the intermediate last up to 30 laps so that would mean a pit window strategy somewhere in the 20s with the hard compounds then being slipped on for the remainder of the scheduled 71 laps. Or do you go with the super softs hope to get at least 20 laps then go to the hard compounds Red Bull Racing has proven to be adept at saving its tires most likely due to the fact that the cars seem to be running far less downforce than Ferrari and other challengers so perhaps this will be the roll of the dice team principal Christian Horner takes at Mexico City.

The intent of pursuing legal action through the UK NCP is to force the issue to the OECD which then may take action against F1. Part of the impetus behind the sport implementing a human rights policy was because of a previous complaint made by the NCP and Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei director of advocacy at Bird hoped this too would provoke action from F1.

It appears that Formula One has taken the decision to disengage with any stakeholders in violation of their own policy and has estranged themselves from all experts who attempt to warn them about the serious human rights risks posed by their activities in Bahrain he said. Our repeated attempts to engage with F1 have fallen on deaf ears particularly since 2021 only to later learn that in the wake of Bahrains horrific human rights abuses they had been busy awarding the regime with the longest contract in motor racing history. We are now escalating the matter by taking it before the UK NCP. Next year Bahrain is set to hold the opening race of next season and its only preseason test but criticism of the regime is intensifying. The Human Rights Watch group is to publish a report next week entitled You Cant Call Bahrain a Democracy Bahrains Political Isolation Laws. It will document the Bahraini governments use of political isolation laws and other tactics to keep activists and opposition members out of public office and public life in what are described as further human rights abuses. Bahrain has spent the last decade cracking down on peaceful opposition and the political isolation laws are yet another example of the governments repression expanding into new spheres said Joey Shea Middle East and North Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch. These draconian laws have made a mockery of Bahrains upcoming parliamentary elections which can neither be free nor fair when you make any political opposition essentially illegal.

We have always been clear with all race promoters and governments with which we deal worldwide that we take violence abuse of human rights and repression very seriously.

A protest by Alonsos Alpine team against the decision to demote him out of the points after he finished seventh in a damaged car will be heard on Thursday. Alonso wrote on Instagram It is an important day for the sport as this decision will dictate if we are going in the right direction. Alonso said his post was in response to messages of support since the penalty. He thanked those who had contacted him on social media adding Its one of those rare times in sport that I feel we are all on the same page and share the same opinion towards rules and regulations. Alonso said after the race that he considered his drive one of the best of his career after he crashed at 180mph his car did a wheelie hit a wall he pitted for a new front wing resumed at the back and climbed to seventh despite damaged aerodynamic parts. The twotime champion has questioned the decisionmaking of officials on a number of occasions this year and his frustrations about the inconsistency of policing of action on track are shared by the majority of his fellow drivers. At the Spanish Grand Prix he accused the FIA of incompetence and lacking knowledge of racing. Criticism of the FIAs running of F1 has been a theme this year and the US Grand Prix was the race after the governing body angered drivers by allowing a recovery vehicle on track in conditions of poor visibility during heavy rain. Alpines appeal will be heard at 1800 Mexico City time 1200 BST on 27 October before this weekends Mexican Grand Prix. The team have questioned the US GP stewards decision to allow a protest by the Haas team despite it being posted after the permitted time limit had expired. The stewards said in their decision to hand Alonso a 30second penalty on Sunday that the Spaniards car was in an unsafe condition because he drove it for some time with a damaged wing mirror and then without one when it fell off. Haas pointed out their cars have previously been given the blackandorange warning flag  demanding a car is pitted for repairs  on three occasions in similar situations this season. At no point during the race were Alpine asked by officials to pit the car and remove the mirror despite calls from Haas to race control. The stewards ruling suggests that any car missing a rearview mirror after an incident will be forced to retire in future. There are also questions about the consistency of decisionmaking after stewards rejected a similar protest by Haas against Sergio Perezs Red Bull. Perez drove some laps with a damaged front wing part of which then fell off the car while he was running.

Ricciardo gives update on 2023 F1 reserve role chances, https://the-race.com/formula-1/ricciardo-gives-update-on-2023-f1-reserve-role-chances/, Daniel Ricciardo says talks are ongoing about a potential Formula 1 reserve driver role in 2023 as he works to lay the foundations for a racing return in 2024. But Ricciardo says emphatically that he does not have a deal in place even though he is working on the possibility. I dont he said when asked by The Race if he has a reserve driver role lined up for next season. This would fit in with a reserve role is it would allow him to attend some races and potentially take what limited testing opportunities are available. Ovals scare me said Ricciardo when asked why he does not plan to race in IndyCar if he cant get an F1 seat., Daniel Ricciardo says talks are ongoing about a potential Formula 1 reserve driver role in 2023 as he works to lay the foundations for a racing return in 2024. The McLaren driver admitted at Suzuka earlier this month that he wont be on the grid next year but remains determined to continue his F1 career the following season. There were suggestions on Saturday at Austin that he had agreed a reserve deal for next year with one of F1s bigger teams potentially his former employer Red Bull. But Ricciardo says emphatically that he does not have a deal in place even though he is working on the possibility. I dont he said when asked by The Race if he has a reserve driver role lined up for next season. For now everythings just rumours. Am I talking Yes but theres no pen on paper or anything like that. Any reserve role Ricciardo takes would likely have to be with one of F1s big three teams especially given F1s fourth and fifth placed teams  Alpine and McLaren  rejected him for 2023. Somethings up. This isnt normal  Ricciardo interview Read more A move into the Red Bull camp would be a surprise given he left there at the end of 2018 and the team would not have a race seat vacancy before 2025 given the twoyear deal Sergio Perez agreed earlier this year. Mercedes and Ferrari could potentially have capacity for Ricciardo as a reserve although the former is the only team that could have a race seat space in 2024 given Lewis Hamilton is out of contract at the end of next year. However recent indications are that Hamilton is keen to continue in the longer term. Ricciardo also confirmed that he expects to still be around in F1 next season given his determination to make a comeback in the future. This would fit in with a reserve role is it would allow him to attend some races and potentially take what limited testing opportunities are available. I will still be around because I still have ambitions for 2024 so I wont completely disconnect from the sport he said. But obviously nothings guaranteed for 24. I dont have a seat that I can say Im going to definitely be driving but Ill still be around and trying to put work in to be back. Could Ricciardo really return to F1 after a 2023 sabbatical Read more Ricciardo also stressed that even with uncertainty about 2024 Im better off sticking to the plan I have and aiming for something else next year rather than pursuing a race seat next year with Haas the only team yet to have confirmed its second driver. He has said repeatedly that his sole focus is F1 and that he has no intention of racing in other categories next season. But he specifically ruled out the possibility of making a move into IndyCar fulltime seemingly for the long term given he says he does not want to race on ovals. Ovals scare me said Ricciardo when asked why he does not plan to race in IndyCar if he cant get an F1 seat. My Formula 1 careerslashambition is not over so thats really first and foremost. 10 F1toIndyCar moves Grosjean can learn from Read more I dont want to deviate I would say primarily for that reason. But also ovals no. Ten years ago I would have said yes but Im OK to admit that Im not OK with ovals. He said that while racing in IndyCar on a roadstreet course programme as old F1 rival Romain Grosjean did in 2021 before expanding to a full season this year does look fun he has not entertained the possibility because of his focus on F1. He added that the romanticising part of it America and all that would be fun but its more of a fantasy.

What the US GP starting grid should look like, https://the-race.com/formula-1/us-gp-starting-grid/, Five Formula 1 drivers in the United States Grand Prix field have now taken grid penalties including two of the frontrunners while another will start from the pitlane. Similar penalties mean Fernando Alonsos Alpine goes from ninth to 14th and Zhou Guanyus Alfa Romeo falls from 14th to 19th. Using the empty grid method officially outlined by the FIA earlier this week this is what we anticipate the starting order to be  subject to any further parts changesLikely US GP starting grid1. Lance Stroll Lando Norris Valtteri Bottas and Alex Albon in fifth through eighth on the revised grid are the other drivers picking up two places from the penalties. Fifth for Aston Martin driver Stroll is not only his best grid position of this year but his best since his 2020 Turkish GP pole., Five Formula 1 drivers in the United States Grand Prix field have now taken grid penalties including two of the frontrunners while another will start from the pitlane. Ferrari loses out on a frontrow sweep as a double penalty for taking a sixth internal combustion engine and sixth turbocharger  both three over the limit for the season  drops Charles Leclerc from second to 12th. But Red Bull loses a car from the front two rows too as a new internal combustion engine means Sergio Perez drops from fourth to ninth. Similar penalties mean Fernando Alonsos Alpine goes from ninth to 14th and Zhou Guanyus Alfa Romeo falls from 14th to 19th. Yuki Tsunoda was later given a fiveplace penalty on Sunday for a gearbox change so should have fallen from 15th to 20th though he will move up one place as Esteban Ocon has a pitlane start after Alpine made unapproved component changes.

Fifth for Aston Martin driver Stroll is not only his best grid position of this year but his best since his 2020 Turkish GP pole. Seventh is Bottass best since his Alfa Romeo started from the same spot in Spain in May and eighth is Albons second best start for Williams after his sixth place amid the many penalties in Belgium two months ago. Though Leclercs weekend has been made much tougher by the penalty Ferrari sporting director Laurent Mekies is optimistic about how much ground he can make up on Sunday. Mark Hughes Element that gave Ferrari edge tripped Red Bull up Read more We knew we were coming into this event with a high possibility of that penalty he told Sky Sports F1. We had to get used to that quite a few times this year. So we also know that there is an opportunity to come back to big points. We will be trying to come back through the field. There may be safety cars and opportunities. We do not set any limits for what Charles can do tomorrow in coming back through the field.

Verstappens 13th win this year equals the record for wins in a season held by Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel and was sufficient for Red Bull to clinch the constructors title for the first time since 2013 securing a double after Verstappen clinched the drivers title last time out in Japan.

Is Russell really ‘not at the level’ of his early Mercedes races?, https://the-race.com/formula-1/is-russell-really-not-at-the-level-of-his-early-mercedes-races/, Russell has had a strong first year at Mercedes despite its struggles with the 2022 car with a notably impressive streak of seven races in which he beat Hamilton early in the season. Team boss Toto Wolff reckoned Hamilton should have been two tenths faster than he was which would have given him a bigger buffer to Russell. Hamilton had a grid penalty at Monza where Russell was third and was hobbled by strategy at Zandvoort where Russell took advantage to finish second. Russell has now targeted getting back on the podium before the end of the season as the goal to end his first year with Mercedes in a good way. We obviously had such a good run of form and then Singapore and Japan were just terrible really from my personal performance and everything that went on., George Russell feels he is not at the level that I probably was earlier in the season after his run of qualifying defeats to Formula 1 teammate Lewis Hamilton continued at the United States Grand Prix. Russell has had a strong first year at Mercedes despite its struggles with the 2022 car with a notably impressive streak of seven races in which he beat Hamilton early in the season. He is on course to finish as the lead Mercedes driver in the championship but has been eclipsed by Hamilton in terms of performance since the summer break. Russell has not beaten Hamilton in qualifying since he qualified on pole in Hungary and came into the US GP weekend off the back of two particularly difficult events in Singapore and Japan. He said after qualifying sixth at Austin where he was half a tenth slower than Hamilton that he and the team did not know why he had suffered a tricky couple of races. A brake issue appeared to hamper Russell in qualifying in Singapore while in Japan he was only slightly slower than Hamilton then lost ground because of strategy in a wet grand prix. Mark Hughes Element that gave Ferrari edge tripped Red Bull up Read more We had such a clean run of form and there were no issues no little problems whatsoever with the car Russell told Sky Sports F1 in the US. Then we got to Singapore and had a bit of a problem with the brakes and that was a recurrence in Japan. Here was just a bit more of a smooth qualifying session for me so sort of pleased to get a bit closer to where I was at the start of the year. But definitely I dont quite feel at the level that I probably was earlier in the season. Russells selfevaluation is slightly harsh but there is evidence Hamilton has established an edge as Mercedes car has improved at least over one lap. So even if Russell has struggled slightly more in the car in the second half of the year it is also the case that Hamilton is performing more consistently after a disrupted first part of the campaign in which he was less at ease with the W13 and was also conducting more experimental work. And Hamiltons improved benchmark means that while Russell can get very close to the seventime world champion on his good days he is further away when things go wrong. While there have been some significant qualifying defeats to Hamilton since Belgian Grand Prix Russell has twice lapped within half a tenth of his illustrious teammate and once more by just over a tenth. Russells recent Hamilton deficits Belgian GP  0.273s Dutch GP  0.499s Italian GP  0.018s Singapore GP  1.321s Japanese GP  0.128s United States GP  0.041s At Austin Russells 0.041s deficit was slightly flattered by the fact Hamilton could not improve on his second run when a loose car balance meant Hamiltons lap got increasingly wayward. Team boss Toto Wolff reckoned Hamilton should have been two tenths faster than he was which would have given him a bigger buffer to Russell. Mercedes front wing may need tweaking after FIA exchange Read more But Russells own qualifying performance was still good and he would have taken advantage of Hamiltons failure to improve and beaten him but for a small slide through the final corner. This was a good reward for the effort Russell put into rebuilding his confidence after nearly shunting in Friday practice which he said had left him being off the pace until qualifying started. That sort of sapped a lot of my confidence across all the practice sessions he said. But fortunately from lap one in Q1 I was sort of back to normal ways. This year its not rare to be honest. Especially with the porpoising with the stiffness of these cars its a bit of a diva at the best of times. You kind of always want to have a clean weekend you never want to put the car in the wall or anything and if you ever have a big moment that sort of takes that confidence away it does take a little while to get back to it. Russell has Wolffs full confidence that hes gonna get back there in terms of his comfort in the car and outright performance but in the meantime he has still been scoring good results. He has two podium finishes in the five races since the summer break although different circumstances would likely have meant Hamilton scored those results instead. Hamilton had a grid penalty at Monza where Russell was third and was hobbled by strategy at Zandvoort where Russell took advantage to finish second. Russell has now targeted getting back on the podium before the end of the season as the goal to end his first year with Mercedes in a good way. It feels like an age ago since we were last in that top five said Russell even though it only happened just before the recent Asian doubleheader. We obviously had such a good run of form and then Singapore and Japan were just terrible really from my personal performance and everything that went on. So I want to get back into that groove.
Toto Wolff the Compulsive Perfectionist Behind Mercedes’s Formula 1 Team, https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/10/31/toto-wolff-the-compulsive-perfectionist-behind-mercedes-formula-1-team, Two Formula 1 drivers were killed in the span of three years at Zandvoort in the seventies. Last years Mexican Grand Prix attracted three hundred and seventy thousand spectators. The Dutch Grand Prix was the fifteenth of the season and Mercedess best results so far were a couple of secondplace finishes. Weve not gone from being an eighttimewinning worldchampionship team to not being able to build cars Hamilton said. Under normal circumstances the Grand Prix would have finished behind the safety car with the race order intact., Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. A few minutes before the start of the Dutch Grand Prix which was held last month in baking sunshine at Zandvoort a beachside racetrack within commuting distance of Amsterdam Toto Wolff the principal of the MercedesAMG Petronas Formula 1 team walked out onto the starting grid. A Grand Prix begins when a row of five red lights above the start line is extinguished but for a short time before the track is a twentythousandhorsepower mob scene. Each of the unearthly longnosed machines is attended by a mobile I.C.U. of generators steel trolleys laptops tire blankets and uniformed mechanics in crash helmets and flameproof gear. Umbrellas shroud the drivers cockpits. Billionaires stalk the grid. Race marshals hold clipboards in red gloves. The noise is beyond belief helicopter blades highspeed wheel guns the desperate howls of the cars the massed emanations of the waiting crowd. In Zandvoort loudspeakers laced the sky with dance music. The afternoon was humid the air felt saturated. Wolff was at home. He is tall dark and Austrian. He could pass for a Sacha Baron Cohen character or for someone who breezes past you in the airport smelling good wearing loafers and no socks. He worked the grid in a white shirt emblazoned with the Mercedes star and the logos of twelve other corporate sponsors black pants teamissued Puma sneakers lovable smile. He kissed peoples cheeks touched elbows gave impromptu TV interviews and yelled lastminute thoughts to his drivers. Somewhere in the fumes was death. Two Formula 1 drivers were killed in the span of three years at Zandvoort in the seventies. At one point I found myself by the pit lane when three cars leaped out red taillights flashing. The speed was like a whip. Wolff who is fifty is the best team boss in the recent history of the worlds fastest motorsport. The formula of Formula 1 refers to a set of rules first enshrined after the Second World War to bring some order to the urge to race dangerous cars on the asphalt of foreign cities. Whereas Nascar is all left turns cars that look like cars and spectatorfriendly oval tracks Formula 1 has a madder purer heart the oldest courses date from a century ago. Races last around ninety minutes. They twist sweep and go down hills sometimes on existing streets. The cars which started out as death traps for daredevils are now specimens of extreme technology flying algorithms that fight for advantages of a hundredth of a secondthe distance of a yard over a threemile track. The sport is esoteric but globally so. Last years Mexican Grand Prix attracted three hundred and seventy thousand spectators. The Singapore race runs through the city at night. Drivers can shed six pounds in stress and sweat. The average television audience for a Formula 1 race is around seventy million peoplefour times that of the typical N.F.L. gameand the best drivers earn soccerstar salaries and lasting fame. When Ayrton Senna a threetime world champion was killed in a race in 1994 the Brazilian government declared three days of mourning. A million people waited in the heat to pay their respects and many spoke of their saudadean inexpressible state of longing for something that is gone. And heres where I can tell youll never amount to anything. Facebook Twitter Email Shopping Cartoon by Stephen Raaka Between 2014 when Wolff took charge of Mercedes and 2021 the team won the world championship eight years in a rowan unprecedented achievement. In Formula 1 there is a constructors championship for the most successful team and a drivers championship awarded at the end of some twenty races. Each team has two drivers. Mercedess star is Lewis Hamilton who earned around sixtyfive million dollars last season. During the teams winning streak Hamilton won six individual world titles bringing his career total to seven. No one has ever won eight. I couldnt think of a better friend. I couldnt think of a better boss Hamilton told me of Wolff. Formula 1 is currently surging in popularity particularly in the United States in part because of a Netflix series Drive to Survive which has embroidered the nerdery of the sport with artful camerawork and bitchy insight into the lives of its protagonists. Wolff who speaks five languages and whose wife Susie is a former racing driver is one of the shows natural stars. Of the ten team principals in the sport only Wolff and his archrival Christian Horner a Briton who runs the Red Bull team have ever won a world championship. But unlike Horner and the rest of his peers Wolff is also a coowner of his team. His onethird stake in Mercedes is conservatively valued at around five hundred million dollars. He sees himself simultaneously as a competitor and as someone who is shaping the future of a multibilliondollar business. The other team principals and I dont mean this in an arrogant way are incentivized for performance only Wolff said. His rivals see this. Hes playing a game and he is always one move in advance one of them told me. But this season Wolff and Mercedes have failed to win a single race. The Dutch Grand Prix was the fifteenth of the season and Mercedess best results so far were a couple of secondplace finishes. In 2020 the team won thirteen out of seventeen. Hamilton who joined Formula 1 as a rookie in 2007 has never gone a season without winning at least one race. Ahead of the U.S. Grand Prix in Austin on October 23rd the team was languishing in third place behind Red Bull and Ferrariits worst position in a decade. Seeing Wolff and Mercedes lose their way has been as disconcerting as it has been refreshing like watching Roger Federer shank his serve the Yankees miss the playoffs Simone Biles miss the beam. It is understandable up to a point. Weve not gone from being an eighttimewinning worldchampionship team to not being able to build cars Hamilton said. We just . . . its wrong this year. The ostensible reason was a change in the rules. Every few years the Fdration Internationale de lAutomobile which has overseen Grand Prix racing since 1906 forces the teams to redesign their cars. Normally the official logic has to do with safety or with making it easier for cars to overtake one another but there is almost always an unspoken motive to upset the existing order of things and to stop one team from gaining a permanent advantage. In the past Mercedes profited from these changes adapting faster than its rivals. But the 2022 reset was unusually farreaching. One of the aims of the new rules was to reconfigure the downforce generated by the cars to reduce the amount of dirty air left in their wakes and to allow for closer racing. At a preseason testing event in Bahrain in March Mercedess new carthe W13appeared to embody the boldest interpretation of this idea. It was skinnier and more futuristic than the rest. People were looking at that thinking Wow. Mercedes are going to blow the field away George Russell the teams other driver told me. Within reason we thought that as well. But the W13 proved capricious. Data collected in the wind tunnel or through computer modelling didnt pan out on the track. At high speeds the car bounced an effect known as porpoising. My back is killing me Hamilton yelled on a long straight in Baku in June where the floor of the car repeatedly hit the asphalt at more than two hundred miles per hour. Attempts to resolve the issue only uncovered more problems. Weve tried and tried and failed. And tried and tried and failed Hamilton said. Andrew Shovlin Mercedess tracksideengineering director who has a Ph.D. in the dynamics of military logistics vehicles compared fixing the W13 to peeling an onion. Even the aerodynamic bouncing manifests itself in about three different mechanisms he said. The other reason for Mercedess poor performance was a sense of injustice and doom. In 2021 with five laps remaining in the final race of the season Hamilton was leading the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on his way to an eighth individual world title and solitary greatness. Hamilton had won the previous three races he had the car on a string. He was unbeatable and we were unbeatable Wolff said. On lap fiftythree in Abu Dhabi the race was interrupted by a crash and then a safety car took over. In Formula 1 when there is a hazard on the track a sports car with flashing lights leads a stately jumbled procession of cars until the danger is cleared. Under normal circumstances the Grand Prix would have finished behind the safety car with the race order intact. But the race director an F.I.A. official named Michael Masi made the decision to divert a group of cars to enable a final lap of racing between Hamilton and the secondplace driver Max Verstappen of Red Bull. The drivers were equal in points in the worldchampionship standings. Verstappen was on fresh tires he slipped past Hamilton and took the title. The F.I.A. later concluded that Masi had made a human error and he left his post. But the result stood.
Ricciardo shock return to Red Bull F1, https://thejudge13.com/2022/10/23/ricciardo-shock-return-to-red-bull-f1/, Daniel Ricciardo is currently the second most successful F1 driver in the sport not to win a drivers world title. Yet today the paddock gossip believes Ricciardo is about to announce a return to Red Bull racing. Ricciardo Red Bull returnTed Kravitz revealed during FP3 in Austin Ive got some good news for Daniel Ricciardo fans. So it could be Red Bull are looking to ditch the increasingly distant Perez and replace him in 2024 with their driver of old  Daniel Ricciardo. READ MORE Red Bull F1 future in doubt as owner dies, Daniel Ricciardo is currently the second most successful F1 driver in the sport not to win a drivers world title. Yet having been dismissed by McLaren a year before his contract expires he appears to have no Formula one drive for 2023. The Aussie driver has refused to entertain drives with less competitive F1 teams and has a plan to get back to the front of the Formula One grid. TJ13 has questioned Ricciardos decision making process because the less competitive team seats available for next season will be similar in 2024. Ricciardo nope taking a sabbatical Daniel was asked again about his future during the driver press event in Austin. You will see me around Ricciardo said. Its going to look different for me but there is still very much still a plan in place. So its not that I am checking out and saying see you later its far from that. Im just putting in a plan to honestly try to get me back to the front of the grid and win races and do all the stuff I know I can do. Ricciardo most successful non F1 driver on the grid Apart from the world champions amongst the current crop of F1 drivers only Valteri Bottas has more F1 race wins than Ricciardo with 10 to his name Ricciardo has 8 victorys. Further Bottas wins came during the era where the Mercedes cars was all dominant and Ricciardo has never been in a championship wining car. Even Ferraris superstar driver Charles LeClerc has won just 5 F1 races and his team mate Carlos Sainz scored his one and only F1 race win this season at this seasons British Grand Prix. The other F1 drivers currently on the grid with F1 race wins include Sergio Perez with 4 2 of which have come this season in the all conquering RB18. The remaining GP winner s are Alpha Tauri driver Pierre gassy and Alpines Esteban Ocon with one Formula One grand prix to their names. Year out not the best plan for Daniel Since his sacking by McLaren F1 Ricciardo has talked about having a year out and a reset to refresh his mind before returning to F1 in 2024. The Aussie described his time for the last two seasons at McLaren as a grind and Ricciardo has been linked with Mercedes to become their reserve driver for 2023. When asked about having Ricciardo for a reserve team mate Lewis Hamilton smiled and replied. I think hes far too talented and hes earned the right to be amongst us all racing. If hes part of our team thatd be great but a third role is not really whats best for him. Hamilton wants Ricciardo racing Hamilton added of the eighttime racewinner If I was managing him hed be racing. Riccioardo was asked again about his future during the driver press event in Austin. You will see me around Ricciardo said. Its going to look different for me but there is still very much still a plan in place. So its not that I am checking out and saying see you later its far from that. Im just putting in a plan to honestly try to get me back to the front of the grid and win races and do all the stuff I know I can do. How does Ricciardo return to the front of the grid A return to the front of the grid for Ricciardo is not on the cars given Ferrari have LeClerc and Sainz locked in on deals that run into 2024 and beyond and as do Mercedes with George Russell. Lewis Hamiltons contract expires at the end of 2023 but he has strongly indicated he wants to continue after that. Its inconceivable Mercedes would not make Lewis an offer. Yet today the paddock gossip believes Ricciardo is about to announce a return to Red Bull racing. Ricciardo Red Bull return Ted Kravitz revealed during FP3 in Austin Ive got some good news for Daniel Ricciardo fans. He may not have a race drive for next ear but we do understand he has closed out a reserve driver role next year. So he will be around and about the Formula One paddock next year.. Kravitz added We thought Mercedes would be where Ricciardo goes because they now have a vacancy because Nyck de Vries their current reserve driver is going to Alpha Tauri. But Im told its not Mercedes which only leaves Red Bull who have a reserve driver on hand at every race Sky F1 commentator was negative about the possibility stating  I thought for him hed be better having a clean break and then coming back. Maybe just keeping your foot in the door doing some simulator work is ideal. Trudging around around Formula One tracks not participating takes a pretty old tough mindset. Ricciardo has persistently said he has a plan to return to the front of the grid despite open offers from Gunther Steiner at Haas F1. Sergio Perez no complimentary F1 driving style So it maybe his conversations with Red Bull revolve around replacing Sergio Perez who has a 1 plus 1 year contract with the team that coyly end next year. Should Perez bomb in 2023 the door would be open for Ricciardo to resume as Verstappens team mate. Ricciardo outscored Verstappen over their 3 season together between 201618 with 457 world championship points compared to Verstappens 377. The Aussie also notched 18 podium positions in that time compared to his teammates 11. Both drivers secured three race victories and though Verstappen was usually considered to be quicker over one lap Ricciardo was the more consistent racer  the record is tight when it came to qualifying. Verstappen only led 2120 in that intrateam qualifying battle and Ricciardo scored the only pole during their time together as team mates. RB1819 suits Ricciardo driving style The new Formula one regulations for 2022 saw the RB18 car perform early with plenty of understeer. Perez prefers this kind of driving style and performed well against his team mate Verstappen. Yet as the season has progressed Red Bull have developed the car more towards one which is rear end limited with a precise front end that understeers which is to Verstappens liking. This has seen Sergio fall away in relative terms both during qualifying and the race from the 2022 world champion Max Verstappen. Finally and of note Ricciardo likes an F1 car that performs similarly to the way Verstappen drives. So it could be Red Bull are looking to ditch the increasingly distant Perez and replace him in 2024 with their driver of old  Daniel Ricciardo. READ MORE Red Bull F1 future in doubt as owner dies
