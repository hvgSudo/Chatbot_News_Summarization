Formula 1 | Russell: Our lifestyle is 'not healthy' in Formula 1 - US Sports, https://lookcharms.com/formula-1-russell-our-lifestyle-is-not-healthy-in-formula-1/, On becoming a Mercedes F1 driver George Russell moved to the front of the grid and has been steadily battling for a podium spot since this year. The Briton thus evokes a lifestyle that is not  not healthy not only for the drivers but also for the entire Formula 1 paddock forced to live at a hellish pace.  We visit 22 countries in one year we stay in 22 different hotels we eat 22 different kinds of food and we experience ten different time zones. For Russell another difficult aspect of his job as an F1 driver is having to systematically satisfy public opinion he who insists on reminding us that he is not a robot. Riding is easy because its my job Im happy as soon as I put my helmet on., On becoming a Mercedes F1 driver George Russell moved to the front of the grid and has been steadily battling for a podium spot since this year. But to shine in the top category of motorsport is not easy with great pressure on the shoulders and it is being constantly or almost on the move around the world. The Briton thus evokes a lifestyle that is not  not healthy not only for the drivers but also for the entire Formula 1 paddock forced to live at a hellish pace. I am driven and motivated by performing winning races and becoming world champion. But this sport is exhausting Russell said.  There is the physical aspect but also the psychological one. You experience so many emotions during a race weekend the successes the ups the downs. Traveling is also demanding on the body. It is not a style healthy lifestyle. And Im not just talking about the drivers but everyone in this sport.   We visit 22 countries in one year we stay in 22 different hotels we eat 22 different kinds of food and we experience ten different time zones. This lack of routine is not good for anyone. Today I would say to you that I can go on until Im 40 but maybe Ill say something very different in five years.  For Russell another difficult aspect of his job as an F1 driver is having to systematically satisfy public opinion he who insists on reminding us that he is not a robot.  So much is expected of athletes these days and I think people sometimes forget that we are human beings. I am a racing driver not an activist or a politician. You are expected to have the right opinion about everything and for me at 24 thats probably the hardest part of the job. Riding is easy because its my job Im happy as soon as I put my helmet on.  Russell also has a thought for the drivers who will leave the paddock at the end of the season whether by choice or lack of opportunity.  Sebastian Vettel is retiring and one of the biggest names in the history of our sport is leaving while Daniel Ricciardo will probably not be driving next year. I have a huge respect for them and they will obviously be greatly missed by the sport but like any industry F1 will run its course. Thats the reality.

Video: F1 pit-stops under two seconds are allowed (and THIS is why), https://racingnews365.com/video-f1-pit-stops-under-two-seconds-are-allowed-and-this-is-why, A change in Formula 1 regulations this year has seen the sport move from 13inch wheels to 18inch ones. This has made the tyres heavier and thus more difficult for mechanics to change all four of them quickly and safely during pitstops. A rule change halfway through 2021 changed the pitstop procedure making it even more difficult for mechanics to complete a lightning fast stop. However at the Mexico City Grand Prix McLaren became the first team to complete a subtwo second pitstop since the introduction of the new regulations changing all four tyres on Daniel Ricciardos car in 1.98 seconds.

The German believes the organisation is waiting too long to take steps and therefore hopes for change in the future he told Der Spiegel. Article continues under ad The motorsport class is revamping the engine regulations in the 2026 season. These new rules should ensure that Formula 1 becomes more sustainable and therefore moves with the times. Although Vettel supports the plans he actually thinks it is too little and too late. I think 2026 is too late to see it as pioneering. Synthetic fuels already exist so why wait another four years he argues. Formula 1 is far too busy with the now and looks far too little at the possibilities of the future. It is busy expanding instead of being a pacesetter for tomorrows mobility with foresight. Vettel critical of the organisation Therefore in the interview Vettel decides to give Formula 1 a slap on the wrist. The veteran driver who is retiring from the sport after this season finds it unjustifiable that it takes several years to address the problems. I find it a bit embarrassing. E10 has been available at the petrol station for more than a decade. I see synthetic fuels more as a bridging technology because producing them requires a lot of renewable energy. This energy can be better used for heating and hot water.

The shortened race  which takes place on a Saturday and decides the grid for Sundays main event  has been held over three weekends in both 2021 and 2022 with that number set to increase to six in 2023. Brazils Sprint will be the final one of the current season but the event is not one that Verstappen looks forward to. I dont like it Verstappen told media including RacingNews365.com when asked for his thoughts on the increased amount of Sprint races in 2023. For me the weekend format isnt one that I enjoy. I dont mind the one practice and going straight into qualifying  I think it probably is even better for me. But theres no feeling in the Sprint races. All the time when I do these races its all about Lets not have damage make sure that you stay in the top three. And for me thats not really a race because then you go into the main race. There are way more points available there anyway and you just risk anyway a bit more there. You do another start probably thats a bit of excitement. Its only people who are really out of position that will move forward because normally you put the tyre on which just lasts the whole Sprint anyway go the race distance and not much happens.

Before Ive ever spoken to anyone else my talks have always been with McLaren first said Norris. Its always how it goes. The best thing for me is signing the contract that I have now just having that confidence and knowledge that youre going to be in Formula 1 for whatever three four or five years. For me thats like the best feeling. It makes you more relaxed more comfortable in the environment youre in. So thats the best of all of it.
Lewis Hamilton calls on the FIA to protect 'integrity' in Formula 1: 'It's not enough at all' | Formula 1, https://www.aviationanalysis.net/lewis-hamilton-calls-on-the-fia-to-protect-integrity-in-formula-1-its-not-enough-at-all-formula-1/, The FIA confirmed last week that Red Bull spent more money last year building and developing the car than was allowed. This is probably less than 5 percent and if the expenses are exceeded the association can impose a fine. Although the penalty kick has not yet been decided Red Bulls rivals are already ahead of the curve. For example McLaren boss Zak Brown has already made his voice heard as Lewis Hamilton said yesterday in Austin that Max Verstappens formation should be punished.

Since his debut with BMW Sauber in 2007 the German has been a member of the F1 paddock. In 2010 he would go on to become the F1 world champion at the age of 19. As time went on Vettel won four straight championships to become the youngest twotime threetime and fourtime world champion.

I participate in a physical activity that you could continue to participate in after a twoyear layoff. After leaving Formula One Sebastian Vettel feels like going into rehab He went on However Im hoping that in two years Ill be able to say No thanks Im done with racing. Im not sure whether I really want to watch the races after retirement. For 16 years my lifes work was Formula 1. Now I secretly anticipate being able to live without Formula 1  almost like Im entering rehab. You may get emotionally connected to something if you enjoy it.

I still know a few individuals that work at Red Bull so Im thrilled for them. He went on They clearly have a lot of momentum from the previous year and the vehicle this year is amazing. Although they were heavier than anybody else they still won races and I believe they have finally lost weight. The automobile is so present but Max is also doing superbly. There are currently only two races left in Vettels career. What lies in store for him moving forward will be intriguing.

IndyCar's F1-testing duo see a superlicence 'blockage', https://the-race.com/formula-1/indycars-f1-testing-duo-see-a-superlicence-blockage/, The two latest IndyCar drivers to appear in Formula 1 sessions both admit they have qualms about the FIA superlicence system. Asked if IndyCar should be represented better Palou said Yeah but I dont think thats going to change at all. OWard has been outspoken on the superlicence situation before and labelled IndyCar underrated in a recent interview with The Race. Because I feel like theres a lot of opportunities that have been wasted because of having a blockage of superlicence. When confirming that Herta did not qualify for a superlicence this year it reiterated it continuously reviews regulations and procedures including with respect to superlicence eligibility., The two latest IndyCar drivers to appear in Formula 1 sessions both admit they have qualms about the FIA superlicence system. Alex Palou drove for McLaren in FP1 at the United States Grand Prix last month and already has a superlicence supplemented by his 2021 IndyCar title. M c Laren stars new attitude towards his F1 dream Read more However Pato OWard  due to drive in Abu Dhabi FP1 also for McLaren  does not have a superlicence despite finishing fourth third and seventh in the last three IndyCar championships while winning four races  the same number as Palou  in the last two seasons. And with both drivers routes to IndyCar having been unusual in themselves  with both diverting via Super Formula in Japan OWard also a sportscar racer and very briefly a Red Bull junior and Palou struggling for budget in European singleseaters  OWard believes theyre also examples of how random the superlicence points situation can become for anyone deviating from the F1 support bill norm. The superlicence systems perceived shortcomings were highlighted by fellow IndyCar driver Colton Hertas plight earlier this year as he tried to gain dispensation to take up a seat AlphaTauri wanted to give him but a lack of intervention from the FIA meant Herta had to forego the seat now taken by Nyck de Vries. Currently the IndyCar champion gets 40 points  the same as for winning F2  but while F2 offers 40 points for second and third which is still enough for an F1 superlicence IndyCars points scale decreases dramatically. The American series gets 30 points for second 20 for third 10 for fourth and eight for fifth. OWard earned just four points for his seventhplace finish this year despite the competitiveness of the series and his season which was hampered by reliability issues despite a record that included qualifying in the top six on every road course and a seriesequalling best average starting position alongside his impressive win tally. The systems quirks have been exposed further this year as Linus Lundqvist  the Indy Lights champion who won the heavilyweighted Formula Regional Americas title in 2020  has qualified for a superlicence via racing on the junior ladder before he has even raced in IndyCar. Asked if IndyCar should be represented better Palou said Yeah but I dont think thats going to change at all. Obviously I have my superlicence. Im happy so I dont care what happens. But obviously I think its very unfair that theres some series that they dont get enough licence points  like Pato doesnt have and he finished third in the championship fourth in the championship and fifth or seventh. A guy that is like that doing 17 weekends racing against people that have 10 or 15 years of experience in IndyCar  that guy is capable of doing a lot in F1. But thats the rules. So hopefully they change it in the future. But I understand that also the FIA they want everybody to go through Europe and through other places. But its true that you could get more points by racing in I dont know a winter series in Thailand and winning that an Asian F3 title is 10 points than finishing fifth in IndyCar eight points. Thats a bit like I dont know if thats fair or not. OWards superlicence situation came back to haunt him in 2019 when Red Bull gambled on adding him to its junior programme  for which he gave up a Carlin IndyCar deal  due to its belief he had enough points for a superlicence. But with the number of competitors in some of the categories namely IMSA Prototype Challenge and Indy Lights that wouldve qualified him for points having been below the FIA requirement he was actually short of the required 40  and while Red Bull appeared willing to keep OWard on for another season he ultimately elected to take up McLarens offer to race for its newlyformed IndyCar team for 2020 where he immediately impressed. OWard has been outspoken on the superlicence situation before and labelled IndyCar underrated in a recent interview with The Race. I think as a driver and I think many others not just me in IndyCar have proven to be capable of being in Formula 1 deserve the shot to be Formula 1 and would be competitive in Formula 1 OWard said. And sadly IndyCar is very underrated. We all need to work as a community to fix that. Because I feel like theres a lot of opportunities that have been wasted because of having a blockage of superlicence. I think massive talents like Max Verstappen who is arguably the best driver on the grid right now he wouldnt have been able to come to Formula 1 if it was for the superlicence. And I think like Fernando Alonso wouldnt have either Kimi Raikkonen wouldnt have either. I get that they want to have something that qualifies you for it. But I really think that theres many qualified drivers that should have the shot and should have the chance to go into Formula 1 and and they dont because of that. I hope its something thats addressed. We all know how hard it is to win in IndyCar and how competitive it is. And anybody thats contending in IndyCar I believe deserves a shot in Formula 1. Or at least the chance right If a team decides to give it to them. OWard added that he thinks drivers who have unusual resumes such as his shouldnt be punished for sampling many championships when it comes to superlicence qualification. Not everyones career is going to be a perfect upbringing because not everybody has millions and millions to spend in order to get to Formula 1 he said. My career and many others have been insane. Japan Mexico prototypes America Europe its super diverse. But a lot of times when its diverse you dont complete championships certain things just happen because you dont have the funding to continue or just stuff like that. And its just a shame because I feel like theres a lot of lost talents that deserve a shot if a team decides to give it to them. But then they cant because of something else in the way. The FIAs superlicence system has not been inflexible since its introduction with the governing body having made changes to championships point allocations. It even made allowances for the impact of the COVID19 pandemic on drivers careers. When confirming that Herta did not qualify for a superlicence this year it reiterated it continuously reviews regulations and procedures including with respect to superlicence eligibility.
Bottas keen to stick around with Sauber for Audi F1 arrival, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/bottas-keen-to-stick-around-for-audi-arrival-at-sauber-f1/10395754/, For current Alfa Romeo driver Bottas who joined the privateer after five years at Mercedes driving for a bona fide works team again is naturally an enticing prospect. When asked in Mexico if he is hoping to stick around at Sauber when Audi jumps on board in 2026 Bottas said Why not Valtteri Bottas Alfa Romeo F1 Team Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport ImagesWhile Bottas conceded Alfa Romeo needs a lot of work to become competitive he hopes extra Audi backing ahead of its official 2026 entry can help the team bridge the gap to the frontrunners. I think the timeline depends on how much Audi is going to support this team before they officially come as a manufacturer. Were still with Alfa Romeo., At Augusts Belgian Grand Prix Audi officially confirmed it would join forces with Sauber as its power unit manufacturer in 2026 when a new engine formula will kick in. After Alfa Romeos sponsorship deal with the Hinwil team lapses at the end of 2023 it is expected Audi will gradually start ramping up its involvement as it becomes a shareholder in the Swiss outfit. For current Alfa Romeo driver Bottas who joined the privateer after five years at Mercedes driving for a bona fide works team again is naturally an enticing prospect. When asked in Mexico if he is hoping to stick around at Sauber when Audi jumps on board in 2026 Bottas said Why not Im 33 years old so I hope that Im going to be there. Bottas explained that Audis entry will help keep both him and the team motivated in the coming years. I would say yes because if you look at the big picture I think its huge. Theres big potential for Sauber with Audi. No doubt they want to succeed in the future. They want to do well and show theyre serious. So I think for any driver on the grid especially for me now being already part of Sauber it would be very interesting to be part of that project. I definitely think its possible. Valtteri Bottas Alfa Romeo F1 Team Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images While Bottas conceded Alfa Romeo needs a lot of work to become competitive he hopes extra Audi backing ahead of its official 2026 entry can help the team bridge the gap to the frontrunners. Theres still work to do no doubt. Thats the fact. But its not that far you know the facilities are there the Finn pointed out. Some facilities some machinery can be better compared to a championshipwinning team. And the amount of people in the team is still a bit less than at least what I saw last year. But with the support of a manufacturer like Audi I see no reason why it wouldnt be possible. I think the timeline depends on how much Audi is going to support this team before they officially come as a manufacturer. Obviously nothing changes for next year. Were still with Alfa Romeo. And of course we hope that we can have a better car than this year. But then I think it depends on the support from 2024 onwards. If Audi are willing to support if theyre really helping a lot and supporting and if the power unit is good for 2026 which is impossible to predict at the moment then why not.

Formula 1 | Latifi received 'very positive' message from Hamilton after Abu Dhabi - US Sports, https://lookcharms.com/formula-1-latifi-received-very-positive-message-from-hamilton-after-abu-dhabi/, Nicholas Latifi spoke again about his accident in Abu Dhabi which triggered the Safety Car that cost Lewis Hamilton the world title. Its just the bad side of social media these days. There were maybe two days where I took social media off my phone and then slowly went back to it reinstalled the apps on my phone. I obviously have PR people who helped me with my social media and stuff and they have access to it. It doesnt really matter especially since in reality I didnt do anything wrong., Nicholas Latifi spoke again about his accident in Abu Dhabi which triggered the Safety Car that cost Lewis Hamilton the world title. The Williams F1 driver had tried to attack Mick Schumacher and is defending his aggressive approach when he had nothing to gain.  I was fighting with Mick for a position very far from the points  remembers Latifi.  I think thats one of the most important things I wanted all the fans to understand. In reality it doesnt matter if Im racing for P20 P19 the points or the podium.   Our car that day was just good enough to be in those positions. If I dont try to get every little thing Williams might as well not show up to the races. So obviously that would be a stupid attitude to have but thats just the public perception.  Subsequently he received death threats on social networks and deplores the magnitude of this affair for a simple sporting event  The aftermath hasnt been very pleasant. Its just the bad side of social media these days. I dont think it really has anything to do with sports.   It was obviously a very high profile incident because of the outcome of what happened. It wasnt just a race at the start of the year it was something at the end of the year with the battle for the championship. Tons of tension and emotions for the fans because it was a very exciting season.   Total support  which has done good for Latifi The Canadian remembers stepping away from social media and receiving support from another driver by doing the same. Indeed Hamilton wrote to him to support him in the face of the wave of hatred that was unleashed against him.  It was a very positive thing to do. Lewis messaged me to get in touch with me. He kind of broke away from the world of social media and everything. He obviously had his own emotions to deal with what he was fighting against.   But he sent me a very nice message of full support. I even received messages from other members of the Mercedes team as well as countless visible messages from different teams different drivers etc.  A voluntary withdrawal on social networks Although he hadnt done anything voluntarily Latifi still had to step back from the wave of hatred he faced in public. He reveals that it was his family and the people managing his communication that helped him overcome this. There were maybe two days where I took social media off my phone and then slowly went back to it reinstalled the apps on my phone. I obviously have PR people who helped me with my social media and stuff and they have access to it.   They said they were trying to clean up as much as they could like everyone else would have in this situation. So I heard a lot from them and obviously from my family members who were still on social media after the fact and noticed how bad it was.   I saw again when I went back all the online hateful abuse and stuff. And I think its clear that its never right. Its just the ugly side of the networks nowadays. It doesnt really matter especially since in reality I didnt do anything wrong. If I had done it on purpose that was another story. But I was doing just my own race.  Jost Capito his boss had explained that this had taken a blow to Latifis confidence which the main interested party does not deny  I got over it pretty quickly and the fact that the winter holidays followed immediately may have helped me.   Other aspects of this year have had an effect on my confidence. I had a few other incidents at the start of the year which doesnt help when youre trying to build momentum. But I wasnt really carrying other traces of Abu Dhabi from the previous year.

Hamilton was memorably involved in a tense battle for the title with Max Verstappen during the last campaign but lost out on the World Championship in the controversial final laps of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. In 2022 Mercedes have been unable to match the pace of rivals Red Bull and Ferrari and unless Hamilton achieves a victory in the final two races of the year it will mark the seventime World Champions first season in which he has not claimed a win. Hamiltons current contract with the Silver Arrows expires at the end of 2023 but he recently voiced his intention to remain with the team beyond then.

However the Alfa Romeo name could be sticking around beyond next year according to reputable journalist Dieter Rencken. According to his report Alfa Romeo want to remain in F1 with Haas potentially the perfect fit for the Italian brand. Recently Haas acquired a new title sponsor in the form of Moneygram reportedly worth 20 million per year. With Moneygrams colour scheme matching Alfa Romeos  red white and black colours  theres certainly some logic to it. Haas new sponsorship deal is an important one for the American outfit allowing them to push towards the F1 cost cap for the first time. They are on course for their best finish in the constructors championship for a number of years sitting in eighth overall with two rounds remaining. Haas tricky history with sponsors Haas were forced to drop Russian sponsor Uralkali ahead of the 2022 season. The company was coowned by Nikita Mazepins father Dmitry Mazepin. Haas opted to cut ties with Uralkali and their driver Mazepin due to Russias invasion of Ukraine. In more bizarre circumstances Rich Energy were their sponsors in 2019. Vocal on social media CEO William Storey had big ambitions for Haas and his energy drinks company wanting to take on Red Bull. The partnership ultimately ended at the 2019 British Grand Prix after Rich Energy grew frustrated with Haas competitiveness. Although theres always been a degree of uncertainty and mystery behind the legitimacy of Rich Energys finances and business as a whole.

He was poised to win the race and place first overall when a power unit problem forced him to quit. The Spaniard was really angry about that and said Car 14 stops and there always seems to be a problem with its dependability. I lost one cylinder 20 laps from the finish line which left me with five cylinders and 20 less power. The race was outstanding up until I pulled away from the McLaren and my teammate Esteban Ocon by 20 seconds. I ran my fastest races both here and in Austin. I believe that I have already lost 60 points this year so we add six more for a seventh place making it 66. Everyone else then obviously receives two points more than they ought to. Next season Alonso will switch from Alpine to Aston Martin. ALSO READ Mercedes Predicts a Gloomy Outcome for the Formula One Race in Brazil Saying It Wont Be As Competitive as Mexico
Las Vegas gets a first taste of Formula 1, https://www.grandprix247.com/2022/11/06/las-vegas-gets-a-first-taste-of-formula-1/, Las Vegas gets a first taste of Formula 1Formula 1 took its globehoping extravaganza to the Las Vegas Strip on Saturday for an official launch party on what it believes will be one of the biggest sporting events in the world  The most expensive too. That needs to be recognized and in terms of price positioning we are going to be on the top side because this is Las Vegas and that is the nature of the customer coming to Las Vegas. Las Vegas next year will make it three U.S. stops and five North American stops total with Montreal and Mexico City. There was some sticker shock surrounding the pricing at the inaugural Miami Grand Prix and Las Vegas is going to cost even more. What we want to create is to have different races with different personality with different characteristics with different fans with different price points with different expectations Domenicali said., Las Vegas gets a first taste of Formula 1 Formula 1 took its globehoping extravaganza to the Las Vegas Strip on Saturday for an official launch party on what it believes will be one of the biggest sporting events in the world  The most expensive too. F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali told The Associated Press the Las Vegas Grand Prix will be the most expensive fan experience on next years 24race calendar particularly from a VIP experience. Tickets were scheduled to go on sale late Saturday night with the price of admission starting at 500 for a threeday general admission pass. Those seats were only added after fans complained that hotels planned to purchase massive ticket blocks and repackage them into entertainment experiences ranging from 100000 to 1Million. But ahead of tickets going on sale seats in the grandstands started at 2500 and the only hospitality package with a price was listed for 10000. Formula 1 has a certain positioning with regard to the kind of sport it is Domenicali told The AP. We are going to deliver the greatest spectacle in the world as a statement of F1. That needs to be recognized and in terms of price positioning we are going to be on the top side because this is Las Vegas and that is the nature of the customer coming to Las Vegas. There will be possibilities for people who want to pay less to spend less. As always in life it is the market pulling the price and then on our side is the responsibility to bring a great event. Las Vegas will be the third race on the F1 calendar Based on an explosion in popularity in the United States created by the behindthescenes Netflix docudrama Drive to Survive F1 in May made Miami its second annual race in the country. Las Vegas next year will make it three U.S. stops and five North American stops total with Montreal and Mexico City. There was some sticker shock surrounding the pricing at the inaugural Miami Grand Prix and Las Vegas is going to cost even more. F1 owned by U.S.based Liberty Media will be a firsttime promoter for the Nov. 18 night race that will use famous Vegas landmarks and rush down the Strip. Liberty Media earlier this year purchased a 39acre strip for 240 million for the construction of pit lanes paddocks and hospitality and CEO Greg Maffei on Saturday said the costs of putting on such a spectacle in a showplace city is evident in ticket prices. Given it is our race as a promoter we want to make it a showcase of what can be done at all the races. We want to capitalize on the fan interest which is enormous in the U.S. the demand is massive Maffei told AP and predicted tickets would sell out within hours. Both for us as a company this will be the largest race in terms of revenues. It will also be the most expensive race in terms of costs Maffei added. Thats just the nature of the event the scale and the nature of Vegas. We will try to create economic choices for fans not all fans can pay the top dollar we understand. This is an expensive place to operate and well try to take advantage of the great things Vegas has to offer. The glitz and glamour that F1 has in mind was showcased at Saturdays launch party Seventime champion Lewis Hamilton and fellow drivers Sergio Perez and Alex Albon were brought in for a demonstration run of their F1 cars on the Strip and Albon said hes the one strangers have been approaching saying Youre that Netflix guy. They dont even know my name. Perez told The AP he expected the Las Vegas race to be the biggest sporting event in the world next year and Haas team boss Guenther Steiner couldnt believe the event was even happening. He said when he heard about Las Vegas he thought really on the Strip. How are we going to race cars here But Vegas can make it happen. The Launch Party actually started earlier this week when an F1 car drove down the casino floor of The Wynn and Saturday included a full day of events that included a pit stop challenge driver appearances a drone show above Caesars Palace and a VIP afterparty with Swedish DJ Alesso at a threelevel nightclub inside Caesars. During the driver demonstration run Hamiltons car broke down and he had to catch a ride back. His car had to be pushed back. But the Launch Party is a sampling of what F1 believes can do to make next years Las Vegas race worth the price of admission. Lewis Hamilton Its getting more expensive to go to F1 events Hamilton doesnt know where Vegas entrylevel 500 standingroom only ticket ranks among other F1 races but did note costs have risen for the consumers. Its getting more and more expensive and less accessible to go to our events and I wouldnt think that is a good thing Hamilton told The AP. But with three stops next year across the United States F1 believes it has options and experiences for every type of fan at different price levels. And on the current path Vegas plans to be as glamorous as Monaco maybe more. What we want to create is to have different races with different personality with different characteristics with different fans with different price points with different expectations Domenicali said. If all Grand Prixs were equal it wouldnt be what we wanted. I think what were going to present to our fans in Vegas will be unique and in the U.S. we are just scratching the surface of what we can do. Story by Jenna Fryer
The start of the Verstappen era echoes the end of Vettel's, https://the-race.com/formula-1/the-start-of-the-verstappen-era-echoes-the-end-of-vettels/, The similarities between Max Verstappen and Red Bulls 2022 season and Sebastian Vettels allconquering 2013 campaign for the team are clear. The 2013 success was the fourth consecutive world championship double for Red Bull spearheaded by Vettel. Of course the Red Bull RB9 was strong from the start but it only got better as the season progressed. Late on it was Lotus  in particular Romain Grosjean  who provided the most serious if fleeting competition to Red Bull. Red Bull lodged a protest with the stewards referring the test to an FIA tribunal., A dominant Formula 1 champion the constructors title sewn up with three races to spare a rival that started well but faded and controversy engulfing a big team. The similarities between Max Verstappen and Red Bulls 2022 season and Sebastian Vettels allconquering 2013 campaign for the team are clear. The 2013 success was the fourth consecutive world championship double for Red Bull spearheaded by Vettel. That proved to be the end of an era whereas whats happening this year could perhaps be the early stages of one given Red Bulls strong start to F1s return to groundeffectdependent cars. But although the Red Bull of today has grown dramatically since 2013 annexing more and more of the Milton Keynes industrial estate it resides on over the years its still recognisably the same team. Adrian Newey is still the conceptual inspiration part of a far larger design group populated by exceptional personnel. Many of the engineering team have carried over and there are also familiar faces working on the cars in the garages. Newey indepth Aborted Ferrari switch Verstappen and retirement Read more And then just as now Red Bull was a team that relentlessly pushed the boundaries in F1. Thats the exact phrase team principal Christian Horner used after Red Bull bagged its personalbest 16th victory of the season at Suzuka when asked how proud he was of the team having won all but four of 2022s 20 races to date. Its something that the team can be incredibly proud of said Horner. There are a lot of people sitting around the engineering office and the garage and obviously back in the factory that are all the same people that did that with Sebastian and are doing it again with Max. The DNA of our team is that were a race team. Were a team of racers we push the boundaries were aggressive in the way that we go racing and we follow our passion that is to go out there and do our very very best. I guess there were risks today with the strategy that we took with the soft and maybe they could have run out of tyre. But we are following Dietrich Mateschitzs mantra of no risk no fun. This has certainly been an increasingly enjoyable season ontrack for Red Bull. As the year has progressed it has become more and more dominant. This year thats been at the expense of Ferrari which won two of the first three races with Charles Leclerc but has only added two victories since. In 2013 that role was played by Mercedes. Then Mercedes had yet to become the powerhouse F1 force it became in the hybrid era. The Silver Arrows claimed its first F1 victory since 1955 the previous season with Nico Rosberg and started 2013 strongly. Eight times in the first 11 races Mercedes took pole position  five of those for new arrival Lewis Hamilton the other three for Rosberg  although victories were a little harder to come by. Rosberg won in Monaco and Germany with Hamilton triumphing in Hungary. But the iconic moment was Hamiltons tyre shredding in Britain while leading prompting Pirelli to revert to the more robust 2012 tyres. That coincided with Red Bull really hitting its stride. Of course the Red Bull RB9 was strong from the start but it only got better as the season progressed. Vettel won all nine races after the August break a run Red Bull could repeat this year across the same number of races. The only difference is that Sergio Perezs win in Singapore means its not been Verstappen all the way. While Mercedes felt quietly encouraged that Red Bull pushed on to the end of the 2013 season given the imminent regulation change to hybrid engines one that required significant changes to the cars that are often overlooked it fell back. Late on it was Lotus  in particular Romain Grosjean  who provided the most serious if fleeting competition to Red Bull. The Mercedes W04 the first overseen by Mike Elliott  now Mercedes technical director then head of aero  was quick but rear tyre degradation was a problem. It was also a car Hamilton struggled to get the feel for meaning he faced a tough challenge from incumbent Rosberg. But it was quick it just wasnt as quick as the Red Bull. Reassessing Nico Rosberg  and how he beat Hamilton Read more The pattern is not dissimilar to that of 2022. Talk then was of a Mercedes title push in the first half of the year an idea that later seemed risible. The same could be said of Ferraris challenge this year which it now seems absurd to have taken seriously. Vettel also performed stunningly well in 2013. At one with team and car hardworking and capable of extracting tremendous pace from a car that produced more underfloor downforce than others without any of the downsides of the highrake concept. He also continued to benefit from exhaust blowing albeit in reduced form thanks to a series of rule changes that had gradually eroded its benefit. Like for Verstappen Vettel victories became inevitable. Whether leading from the front and keeping the competition just out of reach jumping ahead as other cars hit tyre trouble or even battling up the order as he did in India he was superb. Of course there was also the Multi 21 controversy in Malaysia when he overtook teammate Mark Webber against team orders such was his ruthless desire to win. Verstappen has done nothing like that this year but that neardesperation to keep racking up the victories is a factor both share. Verstappen shows no signs of easing off didnt even entertain the idea of potentially helping teammate Perez win the Mexican Grand Prix and likely wont be happy unless he adds wins number 15 and 16 to the tally in Brazil and Abu Dhabi. Hes also had to be even more versatile than Vettel in the way he has chased victories. Ferrari has more consistently started on pole position this year than the Mercedes did in 2013 and only five of Verstappens wins so far have come from first on the grid. One Spa came from 14th. As for the offtrack controversy in 2013 that engulfed Mercedes. It participated in an infamous secret tyre test at Barcelona. News of this test emerged during the Monaco Grand Prix weekend. Testing with the current years cars was banned but Pirelli wanted to run with a representative car after earlyseason tyre problems. Mercedes was set up to run at Barcelona as a result with FIA approval but rival teams were not informed. Red Bull lodged a protest with the stewards referring the test to an FIA tribunal. This reprimanded Mercedes and banned it from that seasons threeday young driver test because this track testing being carried out without the knowledge consent or participation of other teams. Pirelli was also reprimanded for conduct prejudicial to the championship and the secrecy of the test which race drivers Hamilton and Rosberg participated in. While perhaps not on the same scale the similarities to this years cost cap controversy are clear. It was certainly a huge talking point. Vettels Jekyll and Hyde career leaves him short of F1s elite Read more What is most striking about Red Bulls 2013 and Red Bulls 2022 is that on both occasions it was a team and driver very much at one supported by a capable number two driver producing a rare level of dominance. Such seasons may be criticised as boring or too easy. But while they may be too predictable and lack the intensity of the title fights that preceded them both in 2012 Vettel vs Alonso and 2021 Verstappen vs Hamilton they are far from easy to achieve. What we dont know is what follows. But while looming rule changes meant Red Bulls 2013 dominance was always potentially going to be interrupted the following season theres no reason why Red Bull cant be just as strong next year. And just as in 2013 whether or not intrigue will be restored likely relies on one of Mercedes or Ferrari upping their game.
Carlos Sainz: Ferrari driver 'had to reinvent myself' to challenge Charles Leclerc, https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/63498883, Ferrari have had an upanddown season but Carlos Sainz says they have stayed unitedCarlos Sainz is talking about reinvention about reconfiguring his entire approach to driving to try to get on terms with his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc this year. He fought for victory with Verstappen in Canada just losing out in a race Leclerc started from the back with an enginerelated grid penalty. After Silverstone Sainz outqualified Leclerc in Hungary Belgium the USA and at the last race in Mexico where Leclerc complained of engine problems. I dont know. To go through such a difficult season as we did with so few problems in the team is something to be valued., Ferrari have had an upanddown season but Carlos Sainz says they have stayed united Carlos Sainz is talking about reinvention about reconfiguring his entire approach to driving to try to get on terms with his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc this year. The 28yearold Spaniard has had a breakthrough season  taking his first pole position and his first win  but the big concern for this thoughtful perfectionist has been that for a long time in 2022 he struggled to meet his own high standards. It has been an extremely challenging season for me Sainz says. I found a lot of setbacks at the beginning of the year with this new car with the new regulations that didnt adapt to my driving style. I had to reinvent myself in many ways to try and find the pace. I didnt give up. I kept pushing even in the difficult moments and you can see it paying off now at the end of the season in terms of speed. Those few lines are Sainz in a nutshell  honest selfcritical humble determined hardworking. It can sound esoteric when a Formula 1 driver talks in this way  of driving style of struggling with his car. But these things really matter. Look at Red Bull where the car was heavy and somewhat ponderous at the beginning of the year. Max Verstappen was unable to exploit his extravagant skills to the point that  early in the season  he was barely quicker than teammate Sergio Perez. A bit of weight was taken out and the car came alive for the Dutchman who suddenly became effectively unbeatable. Or at McLaren where Daniel Ricciardos struggles with the cornerentry characteristics of the car left him so far adrift of Lando Norris the team terminated his contract a year early. A winner of eight grands prix all but one taken in swashbuckling style with Red Bull finds himself without a seat on the grid next year. At Ferrari Sainzs struggles manifested themselves in Leclercs overwhelming superiority in the first part of the season. The car has an oversteer balance  where the rear is loose and tends to move and slide  which Leclerc loved but Sainz could not handle as well. Leclerc outqualified Sainz in the first eight races in a row at an average advantage of 0.265 seconds as the older man struggled with the characteristics of the car. I have never been 0.20.3secs off any teammate in F1 and I can never accept that says Sainz who was actually marginally faster than Verstappen in qualifying when they were teammates at Toro Rosso at the beginning of their careers and neckandneck with Norris at McLaren in 201920. I always feel like I am quick in any kind of car and for the first time in my career I found myself with a very competitive car but one I didnt feel comfortable and natural with. I had to challenge myself and open up new roads of setup and driving style that I wish I didnt have to open because I wish everything had come a lot more natural and positively. But it happened this way and I stayed disciplined. I tried a lot of things and I made a lot of mistakes trying things. But it was all about trial and error and then coming back and discovering a new path that was a little step forward. A breakthrough and success Gradually things began to come together for Sainz. He fought for victory with Verstappen in Canada just losing out in a race Leclerc started from the back with an enginerelated grid penalty. Then at the British Grand Prix came that first pole won superbly in the wet with Leclerc third behind Verstappen. The maiden win also happened that weekend albeit only after Ferrari had scuppered Leclercs chances with a strategy error. And gradually the qualifying battle has shifted. After Silverstone Sainz outqualified Leclerc in Hungary Belgium the USA and at the last race in Mexico where Leclerc complained of engine problems. In that period the average gap between them has been only 0.013secs  still in Leclercs favour but so small as to be almost insignificant. Against a man some regard as perhaps the fastest in F1 over one lap it is some achievement. Im realistic Sainz says and I know how good Charles is in those conditions. This year he has been driving at a level that is very close to Max or any other driver. And for me hes in a way done a perfect season apart from the two or three typical mistakes everyone does in a year or the luck which maybe he has been lacking the same as me. I am not proud because I am not ahead. The day I am ahead in the statistics is the day I will be proud. Until then I will keep working at it keep finding lap time in myself. But its a statistic that makes me proud about the progress  not giving up not letting myself get comfortable with being 0.2secs behind and always challenging myself to find new ways of driving cars which is not easy. When you see other drivers on the grid you can see it is difficult to turn around a season or turn around the feeling with the car. You dont see it very often. The fact I managed to do that makes me happy. While Verstappen has won the title for the second successive year Sainz is sixth in the standings A lot of people dont perceive my speed Sainz says he does not like talking about his strengths as a driver because when he does he reads interviews back and regrets it. Every time I do an interview and say my positives and I read them I say Ah this sounds superarrogant. Maybe I go more towards the humble too much and stay in that way  modest. But whenever I see something a bit arrogant I kill myself for it. So I always like to let you guys give your opinion of what you see as my strengths while I criticise my weaknesses. Nevertheless like all F1 drivers he spends a lot of time analysing his qualities  good and bad. When told the qualifying statistics he said he knew them already. Of course I know he says. But he wouldnt bring it up in an interview unless explicitly asked. He accepts that may not always be to his benefit. A lot of people... sometimes they dont perceive my speed Sainz says. And I know how fast I am I just dont like talking about it. I dont give it value because if I know in myself and my engineers and the people I work with know it I dont need more people to know it. Maybe I am not doing myself any favours but it is how I am and I am not going to change. The race execution has been a weaker point For all the inner confidence he recognises too that he still has plenty to work on. Sainz beat Leclerc in Mexico but the strong trend this year is that Leclerc has been the faster Ferrari driver in races even in the second half of the season after Sainz made his progress in qualifying. Sainz is happy to admit that is an area in which he needs to progress. The race execution this year has been a weaker point of mine compared to the past he says. This year we are struggling a lot with tyre management on these new Pirelli tyres. The starts with this car for some reason have been extremely difficult and we have an inherent problem that doesnt allow us to get off the line as well as in previous years. With these tyres I dont control as well the tyre degradation and the race pace and its more difficult to be flexible and it doesnt open up as many strategy choices as I would like to have or as I had in the past with McLaren. These are points I am going to work on in the final races and into next season to be more complete. But as you said the qualifying gap has closed down a lot. I know Im up against one of the fastest qualifiers  if not the fastest qualifier  on the grid and so to be so close it makes me proud to know there has been a lot of effort put into it but also that its paying off. I am relatively coldblooded One aspect of race management though has certainly been a Sainz strength this year. In a season in which Ferraris strategy has been exposed  they have made a series of errors that have cost Leclerc big points  Sainz has been a shining light. On a number of occasions he has appeared to be running strategy from the cockpit contradicting his engineers and forcing them into changing their choices. One key example was in Monaco when he rejected their decision to come in for intermediate tyres as the track dried  something that wrecked Leclercs chances of victory  and instead insisted on staying out and changing straight to slicks. It secured him second place between the Red Bulls while Leclerc following instructions and changing to inters started a series of events that dropped him from the lead to fourth. Likewise at Silverstone after a safetycar period in which Ferraris decision not to pit Leclerc for fresh tyres led to him dropping from the lead to fourth Sainz refused  as politely as he could  an order to back up and create a gap to his teammate to protect him from those behind on the grounds that doing so would compromise both their races. This eased his path to victory as he passed Leclerc who then fought valiantly on his old tyres to delay Perez and Lewis Hamiltons Mercedes. Sainz says the ability to read the race from the car is both natural and something he actively tries to develop. I am relatively coldblooded in many aspects of life he says. Sometimes maybe too much. And I dont show maybe my tension passion. But it is also something I work on. Having a good fitness level always allows you to have more brain space when you are driving. Having good confidence with the car and yourself helps you to have more brain space to think about whats going on in the race. And I feel like I always have a clear mind when racing and I can identify the opportunities and the chances to know what is right or wrong from the inside of the cockpit that sometimes is the biggest challenge. I know its one of my strengths and I try to exploit it whenever I have a chance. Sainz says Ferrari want to take another step next season A year of realisation for Ferrari For Ferrari as a whole the season has been a rollercoaster. There is considerable satisfaction that they finally managed to return to competitiveness and that Leclerc was able to go toetotoe with Verstappen for the championship for a while. The cars outright speed is evident from the fact noone will be able to match Leclercs score of nine pole positions regardless of what happens in the final two races in Brazil and Abu Dhabi. But there is also an acknowledgement that mistakes and reliability problems torpedoed their chances questions as to why the car is rarely as effective in races as in qualifying and concern they have fallen behind in the development race just as they did the last time they had a competitive car in 2017 and 2018. There are definitely some mixed feelings in the team Sainz says. We are superproud of the progress we have done with the car to get back to where we are. But this has also been a year of realisation that there are still areas to work on and improve. We are being superdisciplined and supercoherent and ultracritical behind closed doors as to which areas we need to improve to match our competitors in certain areas or be better than them which has to be the target. The team is taking note of everything and we are going to try and take another step next year. Will it be enough I dont know. But its definitely a target. In the past a year such as this might have led to heads rolling at Ferrari. But Sainz says team principal Mattia Binotto has stuck to the noblame culture he is determined to engender after its success at Mercedes and Red Bull. Its incredibly difficult to execute and especially in a team like Ferrari where there is so much pressure and so much attention on us and everyone wants changes immediately as soon as something is wrong Sainz says. Mattia has done an excellent job at not losing the cool head at any point. We have had a lot of difficult moments a lot of criticism and he has remained stuck to his principles. Noone has been fired. We stayed united in the most difficult moments and it shows the progress of our culture. It is always exposed to criticism and high attention on all our mistakes. When we win its incredible  it is the best win in the world to win for Ferrari. To go through such a difficult season as we did with so few problems in the team is something to be valued.
Formula 1 | Bottas talks about his passion for cycling: 'An F1 stress reliever' - US Sports, https://lookcharms.com/formula-1-bottas-talks-about-his-passion-for-cycling-an-f1-stress-reliever-2/, Valtteri Bottas is a great cycling enthusiast having grown up getting used to cycling in his native Finland whatever the weather. Moreover a few days before competing in the United States Grand Prix Bottas took part in a Gravel bike race in Kansas which he won.  I try to get involved in some of my passions which are nature cycling but also coffee. She also finished sixth in the very first Gravel World Championships in history a few weeks ago although we see her mainly in road cycling. Bottas happy that F1 is active in the face of climate changeAlthough a Formula 1 driver Bottas is far from immune to climate change., Valtteri Bottas is a great cycling enthusiast having grown up getting used to cycling in his native Finland whatever the weather. The pilot who won 10 Formula 1 victories says he did not hesitate to face the cold the wind the rain or even the snow on his bicycle to go to class.  I was cycling my daily commute to school even if it was snowing or raining. It was normal for me and so I didnt find it difficult I got used to the wet weather.  Moreover a few days before competing in the United States Grand Prix Bottas took part in a Gravel bike race in Kansas which he won. The Finn explains how he fell in love with this discipline which consists of using a bike whose frame is very similar to that of a road bike but equipped with wider tires thus allowing you to take dirt roads .  Gravel racing is growing rapidly and becoming more and more popular especially in the United States. I took part in my first race last year in Colorado.   Most people ride road bikes or mountain bikes but Gravel gives you the opportunity to explore a bit more to go on roads without any traffic or anyone. Thats the aspect enjoyable of this discipline.  Bottas will launch a new bike race in Finland The Alfa Romeo driver has even created his own gravel race FNLD GRVL the first edition of which will take place next year near Lahti a Finnish city with 120000 inhabitants.  I try to get involved in some of my passions which are nature cycling but also coffee. No doubt there will be good coffee during this race.   I like to reward myself with a beer or a gin and tonic after a bike ride so that might be another possibility. I think there will be several things related to the event that I am passionate.   In Gravel its quite common to see people making campfires and baking marshmallows and stuff but we want to make Finlands nature accessible so people can explore it before maybe doing a sauna or to go swimming right after the race.  A passion that turned into love Bottas passion for cycling extends to his private life he who is in a relationship with Tiffany Cromwell an Australian professional cyclist. She also finished sixth in the very first Gravel World Championships in history a few weeks ago although we see her mainly in road cycling.  When I started training more systematically for motorsport cycling was always part of it for cardio. But when I met Tiffany my interest took it to the next level.   When I do a tough training session or even a race I do it first and foremost to have fun and challenge myself.   Its painful when your heart rate is at its peak for the two or three hours of a gravel race so its something that makes you stronger in a way. Its a sport that makes you allows you to constantly push your limits. Its very satisfying.  In addition to the sporting challenge Bottas likes the fact of being able to escape into the great outdoors.  Its kind of like a stress reliever. I can go to quite remote places explore and forget the hustle and bustle of F1 when Im on my bike.   Its very important on a mental level. I love nature and clean air pure water beautiful landscapes. The less people you meet the easier it is to disconnect.  Bottas happy that F1 is active in the face of climate change Although a Formula 1 driver Bottas is far from immune to climate change.  I have of course seen the effects of climate change in Finland summer and winter have become more extreme. I could already notice a difference in my childhood. Some places have become very windy in Finland and it was not not like this 20 years ago.   F1 is pushing for a greener world it took time for that but people are finally taking it seriously. The teams and the different organizations are making great efforts in this perspective.   At the end of the day its about simple choices like going to work or going to the supermarket for example are you going to use your car equipped with a V8 or take your bike These are simple things.

The demo was the main attraction to the daylong event at Caesars Palace. On 40 acres of land on the northeast corner of Harmon Avenue and Koval Lane F1 will construct a 300000squarefoot fourstory paddock building which will serve as the hub of activity during the 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix. Its hard to make a statement in Vegas because everything is so big said Greg Maffei CEO of Liberty Media the ownership group of Formula One. This paddock building will be a sign of our longterm commitment to the Vegas community. It will serve as a yearround attraction to our fans and will be one of our most spectacular facilities. Between the land purchase and building construction F1 will have invested 500 million in Las Vegas before a race even occurs according to Gov. Steve Sisolak. Between the land and the construction of the paddock F1 will be investing about 500 million in the facility alone according to Gov.

They told me between the land and what theyre building that theyre putting here thats a half a billion dollars right here. On top of everything else theyre building. All the stands on the Strip all the other things that theyre putting together. The economic impact this is going to make in the economy in Las Vegas is going to be astronomical. The Las Vegas Grand Prix isnt just a onetime thing the race is signed to occur at least three times starting next year. But hope is to make the race the marquee one on F1s schedule for the foreseeable future. The intention is for this to be a permanent event said Steve Hill president and CEO of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. Its going to be spectacular. We want it every year and they want to be here. F1 officials plan to use the paddock site for other events outside of nonrace weekends getting their monies worth from the eyepopping facility. This is a true investment in Clark County in the community said Clark County Commissioner Michael Naft. This will be a permanent facility. Yes it will be used for the worlds greatest events for Formula One events. But it will also be here yearround employing people putting people to work. And also boosting our economy and giving us one more thing to be proud of. Formula One CEO Stefano Domenicali said the paddock building cements Formula Ones commitment to the city. We want to stay for a long time Domenicali said. Its with great excitement that were there to celebrate this moment that is just the beginning.  This will be the F1 statement in Las Vegas. We know when you come here you need to be big. When tickets went on sale and some resorts room schedules were opened up this week the price shock caught some people by surprise.

Room rates began around 700 per night but were well over 1000 per night for locations along the race route. While the costs are high the race will draw droves of people from all over the world who will gladly pay the heightened fees Sisolak said. People are willing to pay from all over the world to come see it he said. People are going to be staying all over town here. Every hotel has got increased room prices by 300400 percent. Its not that theyre gouging people theyve got an investment in this as well. The skyhigh hotel prices speak to the international draw a segment that is still slowly returning to Las Vegas postpandemic Naft said. People from all over the world have been watching for those rates become available and bookings open up Naft said. It also speaks to the incredible impact this is going to have on our economy. Those room rates also translate to hotel tax revenue sales tax revenue and those are the dollars that literally help boost the economy for people like me and family who live here. The people who will be in the stands around the Strip and surrounding area next year arent the only ones who will be excited. The drivers they will be watching are itching to race along one of the most famous stretches of roads in the world. I think its going to be wild to be honest said F1 star driver George Russell. Super excited to come here and race in Vegas. I think weve seen the momentum that Formula One has in America and bringing the race to Vegas is just topping that off at another level. As drivers as people in the sport were excited. Contact Mick Akers at makersreviewjournal.com or 7023872920. Follow mickakers on Twitter.
‘I always believed in the project’ – Max Verstappen on Red Bull his second title and how long he plans to race in F1, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.i-always-believed-in-the-project-max-verstappen-on-red-bull-his-second-title.7mbvN7HjprbEf3VGYDKFzM.html, Though it is now under the Red Bull Powertrains banner courtesy of a brandnew division and huge investment from the energy drinks firm Honda continue to play an integral role  and its their constant development from one year to the next that has given Red Bull the grunt to fight at the sharp end. With the regulations more or less staying the same for the coming years we can take advantage of that. He adds Red Bull are my second family they were already world champions before I joined. We had a bit of a tough time at the start but I always believed in the project. And thats helped us make that final jump that we were missing to fight for a title. Verstappens second title has been impressive for different reasons. Verstappen described Red Bull as his second family and believes they can be successful for yearsThe first one was very emotional because you realise you have achieved everything in the sport you wanted to achieve he says., With pack up well under way at Suzuka on Sunday night Max Verstappen took five minutes to sit down with those closest in his team open a beer and reflect on what he had just achieved  the defence of his Formula 1 world title. There would not be much time to celebrate that night as he had already planned to fly back home so he could maximise the hours with his family and friends before the following race in Austin. Between a string of interviews  including one with us for broadcasters  there was only really time for a quick team photo debrief and short calls with his father and then his mother. READ MORE Hes been perfect  Horner full of praise after Verstappens recordbreaking victory Racing drivers dont tend to dwell on success. The focus is always on what is next. Youre only as good as your next lap. But in those five minutes Verstappen gave himself the chance to take it all in. This has been a remarkable season  one which after three races saw the now twotime world champion 46 points adrift in the championship hunt courtesy of two mechanicalrelated retirements. But he then went on a run of 13 wins in 17 races smashing the record of most wins in a year 14 with two races still to go. Victory in Mexico also set a record of the most points in a year 416. Its been an incredible season says Verstappen. As a whole team we definitely didnt expect something like this. We had a competitive start but we retired two times in three. It was not the best start to try and defend the title. After that we had a great turnaround  we kept on pushing kept on believing kept on improving the car which was the most important area. It is why we are here today. As a team we made very few mistakes. You cant be perfect but for most of the races we have been close to perfect. Verstappen and Red Bulls season did not get off to the best start after two retirements in the first three races  including in Australia Though Red Bull failed to win a title between 2014 and 2020 they remained operationally shrewd throughout and alongside building a mighty car for the newfor2022 regulations that has been one of the fundamental reasons they have been so relentlessly successful this year. Another has been the power unit in the back of the car. Though it is now under the Red Bull Powertrains banner courtesy of a brandnew division and huge investment from the energy drinks firm Honda continue to play an integral role  and its their constant development from one year to the next that has given Red Bull the grunt to fight at the sharp end. READ MORE I never thought Id be able to win 14 races in a year says recordbreaker Verstappen in Mexico Working together with Honda has been incredible and is incredible and they definitely deserve it that weve won it on their own track added Verstappen at Suzuka. Thanks goes out to the whole team back at the factory and those contributing to the powertrains division. They have been working flatout nobody is lacking motivation  and thats how I like to see. Verstappen himself has been key to their success. Having joined the team back in 2016 winning a race on debut with them in Barcelona he has set about building a dynasty that is showing shoots similar to that of Michael Schumacher at Ferrari Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes and Sebastian Vettel before him at Red Bull. But he knows its more than just about him  its about the people around him and how everyone gels together to work towards the same goal. Verstappen has been key to Red Bulls return to success after joining in 2016 and winning his first race for the team in Spain That building something special is what were trying to do he says. With the regulations more or less staying the same for the coming years we can take advantage of that. He adds Red Bull are my second family they were already world champions before I joined. We had a bit of a tough time at the start but I always believed in the project. The whole team we have  back at the factory designing the car combined with the powertrain division  we have a really great group of people who I think can be successful for quite a few years. TOP 10 We rank the best drives of double world champion Verstappens F1 career so far It goes higher up than me to make sure we find the right people and putting them into the right position. What is most important is that everyone gets on well and everyone understands their role. Honda and now coming into our own powertrains division its about understanding how to work together. Implementing the two together has been really strong the last few years. And thats helped us make that final jump that we were missing to fight for a title. Verstappens second title has been impressive for different reasons. Last year he fought tooth and nail to the seasonending race and clinched the title on the final lap of the season edging out Lewis Hamilton. This year after a slow start he has gone on an extraordinary run of form that has made the title a formality. Its no wonder then that each championship feels different. Verstappen described Red Bull as his second family and believes they can be successful for years The first one was very emotional because you realise you have achieved everything in the sport you wanted to achieve he says. The second one because of the season we have had is probably more rewarding. Its very different feelings which I think is great because it would be a little bit boring if they are the same. READ MORE I was there when Jolyon Palmer Will Buxton Mark Hughes and more reflect on Max Verstappen milestones Winning that first title had a positive effect on Verstappen in that it made him more relaxed and has seen him pull back on his allout attacking approach by the smallest of margins. In doing so it has also made him a more potent force. Make no mistake having an incredible car with a team working efficiently in terms of operations and strategy has made life easier  but hes still had to get the job done. You grow as a person every year you learn a lot from every single year what has happened at every single race you try to improve as a driver he says. I dont think you improve in terms of raw speed but because of the experiences you have had in the past you try to put that into play. In some tricky situations sometimes that can help you out because of the previous experiences you have. Verstappen has appeared a lot more relaxed behind the wheel this season after winning his first championship

Fernando Alonso open to race with Max Verstappen beyond F1, https://www.sportskeeda.com/f1/news-fernando-alonso-open-race-max-verstappen-beyond-f1, Fernando Alonso has said that hes open to racing with Max Verstappen in other racing categories beyond F1. When quizzed if the LeMans team could feature Verstappens dad as the third driver Alonso joked that he would rather have the junior Verstappen behind the wheel. Lets see if Max is that lucky.Fernando Alonsos frustration after another DNF in MexicoFernando Alonso was having a very strong race in Mexico. He was on his way to finish the race as the best of the rest but a late race power unit issue meant he had to retire. I think I lost 60 points already this year so we add another six for seventh place so it is 66., Fernando Alonso has said that hes open to racing with Max Verstappen in other racing categories beyond F1. The two drivers share a great camaraderie and have expressed respect and admiration for each other. In an interview with De Telegraaf Alonso was asked if he would be interested in racing alongside Verstappen to which the Spaniard said I know Max wants to do some endurance one day and I know hed like to do the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Im certainly open to doing that together. I think we should give the idea a chance if we can drive for a competitive team. When quizzed if the LeMans team could feature Verstappens dad as the third driver Alonso joked that he would rather have the junior Verstappen behind the wheel. He said His father for Le Mans At the moment I prefer Max. But I also have a lot of respect for Jos. He could develop the role of team principal Alonso was also asked whether Verstappen would emulate the seven titles of Lewis Hamilton and Michael Schumacher. He said It will be difficult for him to reach the seven titles of Lewis and Michael Schumacher. Certainly Max has the talent to get there but you have to have a car that is very competitive for many years and you never have that guarantee. Now its easy. Everything points to Red Bull dominating in the next few years but we dont know for sure. Lets see if Max is that lucky. Fernando Alonsos frustration after another DNF in Mexico Fernando Alonso was having a very strong race in Mexico. He was on his way to finish the race as the best of the rest but a late race power unit issue meant he had to retire. The Spaniard was very frustrated with that saying Car 14 stops and it always seem like there is reliability issues for Car 14. 20 laps before the end I lost one cylinder so I was running with five cylinders so I had 20 less power. I was 20 seconds in front of the McLaren and my teammate Esteban Ocon  so I think until that point the race was exceptional. Here and Austin I did my best races in terms of pace. I think I lost 60 points already this year so we add another six for seventh place so it is 66. Obviously everyone else then scores two more points than what they should. Alonso will move to Aston Martin next season from Alpine. Poll  0 votes

Ratcliffe is clearly impressed with Hamiltons driving skills away from Formula 1 having to hold on as the seventime Formula 1 world champion put the car to the test.

Formula 1 | Hamilton and his 'Mercedes F1 family': 'We have no limits' - US Sports, https://lookcharms.com/formula-1-hamilton-and-his-mercedes-f1-family-we-have-no-limits/, After Fernando Alonso Lewis Hamilton is the second oldest driver on the F1 grid. Another element that makes Lewis Hamilton feel so happy at Mercedes his boss Lewis Hamilton also imposes an iron discipline to hold on during the many weekends of Grands Prix he says. Would George Russell have Lewis Hamilton as a mentor and model Behind the scenes moreover Lewis Hamilton is doing a colossal job to advance development as much as possible., After Fernando Alonso Lewis Hamilton is the second oldest driver on the F1 grid. However the driver continues to be and feel in excellent physical shape as evidenced by his results during this second half of the season where George Russell appears more in the background. With the FOM the Mercedes driver confirmed that he was at the top of his physical form but also mentally.  As far as my physical wellbeing goes Ive never felt better physically because I really focused on that as I got older.  I generally like to drive and I work on a plan. I cant tell you what it is yet but theres no limit to what we can do.  If Lewis Hamilton feels so good about himself it is also thanks to his offroad projects with Mercedes in particular with Mission 44 to promote inclusiveness and diversity in sport. I want to be creative and keep doing all the other things I get to do. I can be myself in this team  and the support from Mercedes has been amazing since day one. Together its not just about winning we can be one of the many people around the world trying to change the world for the better  we can do that Mercedes its a huge brand that can have a huge influence on the world.  Another element that makes Lewis Hamilton feel so happy at Mercedes his boss  Toto Wolff directeur de lquipe Mercedes is one of my best friends. Weve had tough times weve had tough negotiations theres been emotional outbursts roller coasters of emotions together over the years but were like family. I want whats best for him. He wants whats best for me.  We can always pick up the phone and talk about whatever we want. Our values are the same and our goals are the same  for the brand to help this team grow and achieve its goals.  Lewis Hamilton also imposes an iron discipline to hold on during the many weekends of Grands Prix he says.  So I try to use all my time and the quietest part of the day especially in Grands Prix is the end of the day because theres no one around me and thats is where I have no distractions. I can review the data  and Im in constant contact with the simulation team at the factory so while its running Im able to have live interactions with the rider whos on the track.  I eat on the track and Im exhausted once Im done. I start to relax at the end I come back to the hotel and there is little time between going to bed and waking up  thats what I like.  I dont want to finish here early and go to dinner. I dont feel like going to dinner and wasting time chattering away. Im here for one reason and thats to win races. For me this le dner les autres vnements durant un weekend de Grand Prix is a distraction so I dont do it often if ever.  Would George Russell have Lewis Hamilton as a mentor and model Lewis Hamilton however had a hair to scratch  much younger than him  in the person of George Russell who replaced Valtteri Bottas this year. The arrival of George Russell could have appeared as a transfer of power possibly taking place under tension However this is not the case and Lewis Hamilton is currently working very well with his teammate and compatriot. Lewis Hamilton describes his mentorship with him.  As for the arrival of George he was one of the youngest pilots jeunes pilotes Mercedes  he used to sit behind during debriefings and engineering before so he knows the process.  He arrives and fits in he knows what to expect. And from my side I just tried to be as welcoming and include it  trying to communicate a lot about the car what can I test what can you test for take us where we want  I just try to work with him like I did with Valtteri. When you add new people it takes time for everyone to get into the rhythm but he did an amazing job we found a decent rhythm between us quite early and we continue to work on all points weak to continue to be on this rhythm.  Engineer Lewis Hamilton However even at the top of his form Lewis Hamilton cannot fight for victories on a regular basis so disappointing is the Mercedes W13 and so solid is Max Verstappens Red Bull. Much remains to be done and the Briton knows it. The slope we have to climb is enormous.  For us its important to imagine that its the biggest steepest and most difficult mountain to climb because if you think its going to be a normal hill you wont achieve your goals. You have to think this is the hardest climb you could imagine which means you have to dig deep.  Behind the scenes moreover Lewis Hamilton is doing a colossal job to advance development as much as possible. He talks about this work behind the scenes he had notably experimented with original settings at the start of the year to try to unravel the mystery of the Mercedes. There is a lot of work we have already done so far to understand where we are where we went wrong in previous decisions that were made last year and this year.   As for taking the right steps for next year its not easy to navigate because there are a lot of different options but communication is what Im trying to work on with everyone making sure theres no misunderstanding about what I feel in the car and what I want in the car and making sure were continually creating a dialogue.  These days I sat with Shov le chef de piste Andrew ShovlinRon Meadows directeur sportif and Mike Elliott directeur technique  by simply asking questions  this is what worries me this is what keeps me awake what can we do about it How can I help you do better do more Theres not much we can do as we have to trust the process but its about letting people know youre there  its not up to them to do it on their own we will do it together.

Protestors blocked some roadways to Sao Paolo airport in a bid to protest the decision against their favorite candidate. To further fuel the fire pictures of F1 cargo having been stuck in the protests emerged on social media causing further cancelation speculation amongst fans. The sport however has confirmed that the race will continue as scheduled from November 11th to 13th 2022. Being a highdownforce track the circuit at Interlagos is likely to suit Ferrari and Mercedes over Red Bull. With quite a long straight into Turn 1 however the RB18 is likely to be dominant in the final sector. With early forecasts indicating heavy rain throughout the race weekend predictions for the race have been turned on their heads with no clear favorite. The battle for P2 in the drivers championship between Sergio Perez and Charles Leclerc is still going strong and is likely to go on till the very end of the season in Abu Dhabi. Poll  0 votes

The German has been part of the F1 paddock since 2007 when he made his debut with BMW Sauber. He would go on to become the youngest F1 world champion in 2010. In the subsequent years Vettel became the youngest twotime threetime and fourtime world champion winning four consecutive titles.

For Vettel who has lived and breathed F1 for the last 15 years he said that its not going to be an easy transition. Refusing to rule out a possible return he said to Der Spiegel Id like to rule it out. But I cant. I have no idea how Ill be ticking in a year or two. As far as the physical is concerned I do a sport that you could still return to after a twoyear break. He continued However I hope that in two years I can say No thanks I dont need racing anymore. Im not sure if I want to see the races at all after retirement. Formula 1 was my life purpose for 16 years. Now I secretly expect myself to cope without Formula 1  like Im going into rehab. If you like something you can also be attached to it. I want to go the other way detach myself and find out there are other exciting things. The Aston Martin driver 36 is 11th in the driver standings in his final F1 season with two races to go. Sebastian Vettel urges Max Verstappen to target 16 wins in a season Max Verstappen beat Sebastian Vettel and Michael Schumachers record for most wins in a season 13 by winning the Mexican GP last week. Vettel was quite complimentary of Verstappen and urged the Red Bull driver to target two more wins which the Dutchman will achieve by winning the last two races. Vettel said Well done to him. I think hes had a hell of a season so hopefully he goes on and get 16 wins by the end of the year because anything else will be a disappointment. It is great for Red Bull and I still know some people there so I am really happy for them. He continued Obviously they have a lot of momentum from last year and the car this year is incredible. They won races even though they were heavier than anybody else and I think now theyve finally got the weight out. So the car is there but Max is doing an amazing job as well. Vettel now has only two races left in his career. It will be interesting to see what lies ahead for him. Poll  0 votes
Red Bull advisor predicts 'it will be difficult to build a future together' if Mick Schumacher stays at Haas, https://www.sportskeeda.com/f1/news-red-bull-advisor-predicts-it-will-difficult-build-future-together-mick-schumacher-stays-haas, Red Bull chief advisor Helmut Marko feels Mick Schumacher might not remain at Haas for the 2023 F1 season. Recapping Mick Schumachers second season in F1 Helmut Marko admitted that the driver started the season with far too many accidents. The Red Bull advisor however was complimentary of the Germans second half of the season where he scored points and has been the better Haas driver. Nico Hulkenberg a perfect replacement for Mick Schumacher MarkoHelmut Marko revealed that he felt Nico Hulkenberg could prove to be the perfect replacement for Mick Schumacher. Meanwhile rumors abound in the paddock that Nico Hulkenberg could effectively be making a return to the sport next season as a Haas driver replacing Mick Schumacher., Red Bull chief advisor Helmut Marko feels Mick Schumacher might not remain at Haas for the 2023 F1 season. Marko feels that the way Guenther Steiner has publicly ridiculed Schumacher shows that the team has no confidence in the German and does not see a future with him. Speaking to the media on the subject of Schumachers future Marko said When you criticise your driver so openly and that has happened a few times it shows that no confidence within the team exists. Then it will be difficult to build a future together. Recapping Mick Schumachers second season in F1 Helmut Marko admitted that the driver started the season with far too many accidents. The Red Bull advisor however was complimentary of the Germans second half of the season where he scored points and has been the better Haas driver. Marko said Judged from the outside the first half of his season did not seem strong with many serious accidents and incidents resulting in a lot of damage. That of course has major consequences for the team. But on the other hand there are good races in Britain and Austria. He managed to improve really well in the second half of the season sometimes having some bad luck with unlucky Haas strategies and technical problems. Nico Hulkenberg a perfect replacement for Mick Schumacher Marko Helmut Marko revealed that he felt Nico Hulkenberg could prove to be the perfect replacement for Mick Schumacher. The German veteran has always been a quick driver and proved himself earlier this season in his two races as a substitute for Sebastian Vettel. Marko said If there were a great promise for the future I would bet my money on it but I dont see anyone who fits that profile. And for the team it has a lot at stake. The difference between for example eighth or ninth place in the constructors championship is a difference of X number of millions in terms of prize money. Thats why I think Haas are going for a veteran. He further added Hulkenberg has the right look and has already proven his worth. Without test kilometers he has repeatedly jumped into the car as a test driver and in that role he has always performed. That speaks for him. But for the team the most important question will be who can lead the team stably into the future Meanwhile rumors abound in the paddock that Nico Hulkenberg could effectively be making a return to the sport next season as a Haas driver replacing Mick Schumacher.

Magnussen: “No problem" with Hulkenberg as 2023 F1 teammate, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/magnussen-no-problem-hulkenberg-2023-teammate/10395329/, The choice of Hulkenberg is intriguing because he and Magnussen who is under contract for 2023 have had their moments of controversy in the past. Most famously back at the 2017 Hungarian Grand Prix Magnussen told Hulkenberg to suck my balls after they came to verbal blows following a laterace battle for a pointsscoring position. But with Magnussen and Hulkenberg having long moved on from that moment there is unlikely to be any lingering tensions. And Magnussen himself is clear that having someone alongside him with the kind of experience that Hulkenberg has would be a positive thing. I think Ive said many times now that I dont have a problem with Nico at all said the Dane., Listen to this article Haas is currently weighing up its driver options for the second seat in 2023 with it believed to be a straight call between retaining Mick Schumacher or going for the more experienced Hulkenberg. The choice of Hulkenberg is intriguing because he and Magnussen who is under contract for 2023 have had their moments of controversy in the past.

And Magnussen himself is clear that having someone alongside him with the kind of experience that Hulkenberg has would be a positive thing. I think Ive said many times now that I dont have a problem with Nico at all said the Dane. Actually I respect him as a racing driver. I dont really know him as a person. But certainly as a racing driver Ive always respected him. So I would have no problem. But I dont have an opinion on whether or not he should be in the second car. Mick is doing a good job at the moment. He had some issues in the beginning of the year and a few crashes but he is certainly faster now. Mick Schumacher Haas VF22 Kevin Magnussen Haas VF22 Photo by Steven Tee  Motorsport Images Hulkenberg has most recently been an F1 supersub and was last called up by Aston Martin to fill in for the unwell Sebastian Vettel at the Bahrain and Saudi Arabian Grands Prix. Speculation about him moving to Haas ramped up earlier this week when it emerged that Aston had signed Stoffel Vandoorne as a reserve for 2023. Speaking to Servus TV over the Mexican GP weekend Hulkenberg said he was upbeat about the progress of talks with Haas even if nothing was finalised. At the end of the day its not my decision he said. Im not making it. There are still talks going on. Im relatively optimistic but well have to be a little patient there. Schumacher is aware that time is running out for him to impress his Haas bosses enough to convince them to keep him for 2023. But he says it is pointless getting distracted by things that he cannot control so his sole focus is on delivering crucial points. Im here to do my job and Im here to do it well he said in Mexico. So thats what my main focus is on and thats everything that Im in control of. Im just trying to do my best and thats what Im here for.

The Frenchman has been Pierre Gaslys manager for several years and will therefore also take De Vries under his wing. Previously the Dutchman did not have a manager. Article continues under ad His contract negotiations with AlphaTauri for the 2023 contract were therefore done entirely by De Vries himself. Next year as a rookie in the premier class there will be more demands on the 27yearold driver than ever so De Vries will be working with a manager for the first time. Le Goff is mainly expected to take many tasks off his hands. From now on I do have help from a management as it were. Personally I dont really like using that term because I still very much value my relationship between the team and myself. Nothing will change in that either but I do now have help from Guillaume le Goff who relieves me of everything De Vries told Jack Plooij in conversation. De Vries never felt the need for a manager because he wants to be directly connected in the team. He considers that important for personal relationships and a manager in between does not have a positive influence on that according to the upcoming AlphaTauri driver. Now however the time has come so De Vries has enlisted help from outside in the person of Le Goff. Read more Departure of De Vries and Vandoorne opens door for Ricciardo at Mercedes

Heading into the 2022 F1 Mexican GP the Silver Arrows claimed that the race was going to be the teams best opportunity to fight for a win. The race weekend did feature a competitive Mercedes but they were once again trumped by Red Bull and Max Verstappen. When asked by RacingNews365 if Mexico was the teams best opportunity to win a race the Mercedes boss admitted that was the case but also revealed that he was proud of how the team was able to compete with Red Bull. He said On the simulations it says yes this was our best chance to win this year. But we see the tendency that we are able to compete and Im really proud of the team with what we did this weekend. We experimented with a lot of things  the engine guys pushed the boundaries to really give us maximum performance so I think it will be a mix between trying to maximise this year and trying the most for next year.

Theres no reason to be overwhelmed finishing second and fourth but we have a long way to catch up. We have the winter and I think were doing some good development on the car and some of the biggest steps might be more than just adding a few points of downforce. Were giving it whatever we have and more in order to bring us back in a position to fight for a championship. Mercedes could have had a better race in Mexico In the teams 2022 F1 Mexico GP debrief video chief strategist James Vowles claimed that Mercedes could have had a better result if the team did not get boxed into changing for hard tires to maintain track position. In the video he explained We had two choices let Sergio Perez effectively undercut us but go long and then fit the Soft tyres or stop and given the length of stint the Hard would have been really the tyre that could have made it the Soft would not have made that level of stint. We decided that track position was more important at that stage and furthermore we had some data from Nicholas Latifi that had already stopped and Hard wasnt terrible. He added So we opted to stop put Lewis Hamilton on the Hard tyre and go to the end of the race under the hope that potentially Max Verstappen was going to drop off that Medium curve much as we did see degradation at the end of our stint. Many thought Mercedes could have challenged Red Bull better had the team used a different strategy. Red Bulls aggression however did appear to be the differentiating factor between the two teams.

How F1 2022's top teams have approached a key packaging dilemma, https://the-race.com/formula-1/how-f1-2022s-top-teams-have-approached-a-key-packaging-dilemma/, But looking at the Red Bull we can see the bulge in the body surface for the outer end of the lower SIPS clearly. The illustration shows the outer ends of both the upper and lower SIPS. I have highlighted with a red circle where the end of the upper SIPS should be. The lower one is between the lower surface of the underfloor and the upper surface of the underfloor and the upper one is between the inner surface of the radiator inlet duct and the upper surface of the sidepod. So it will be 2023 before we see which of these top three teams went down the right route initially., You never know how your egg is boiled until you crack open the shell and its similar with Formula 1 cars. Theres a reason for everything when it comes to packaging the thousands of parts that make up the car and things arent always as they appear before you break through the shell. The Side Impact Protection System SIPS is as the name suggests there to protect the driver in a side impact. This is mainly for accidents involving a sideon impact with a barrier or wall rather than another car although they will also be of use in that style of accident. There are two of these that must be placed in a certain position relative to the cockpit opening one low down and the other higher up. As we can clearly see on the Mercedes the upper one red arrow is entirely separate from the sidepod and used as the rearview mirror mount. The lower one blue arrow is more difficult to spot but I wouldnt be surprised if this detail on the sidepod is the outer end of it. But looking at the Red Bull we can see the bulge in the body surface for the outer end of the lower SIPS clearly. The illustration shows the outer ends of both the upper and lower SIPS. I have highlighted with a red circle where the end of the upper SIPS should be. The lower one is between the lower surface of the underfloor and the upper surface of the underfloor and the upper one is between the inner surface of the radiator inlet duct and the upper surface of the sidepod. Both are very neatly packaged between two body surfaces. On the Ferrari illustration we can only see one which is nearer to the middle of the sidepod vertically. There are no bumps or bulges for the outer ends of either top or bottom SIPS but they are inside there somewhere. Perhaps this is why the Ferrari sidepods are relatively fairly bulbous in this area Mercedes chose to have one of its SIPS cones as a standalone component Red Bull packaged these so tightly that the end of the bottom one needed a bulge while Ferrari simply enclosed them in bodywork. As I said you never know how well the egg is boiled until you crack the shell and its too late if its not to your liking by then. In the case of these three teams they didnt know what the others had come up with until the cars broke cover this season. And relocating the SIPS cones is a very difficult and expensive thing to do. Gary Andersons take on F1 tyre blanket ban amid driver backlash Read more It would require a revised chassis structure in that area to withstand the loads and also a new underfloor and sidepods. With the budget cap restricting spending all of that would just be too much. Packaging an F1 car is no easy task and we have on occasion seen problems arising from it being a bit too compact. But under normal circumstances and considering where they are located on the car wrapping things like the SIPS structures as tightly as possible has been the norm for many years. If I was looking at concepts for next year it would be a combination of the lower one from Red Bull and the upper one from Mercedes. That doesnt mean the Ferrari one isnt the best but it does look like it makes the sidepod a bit more cumbersome. So it will be 2023 before we see which of these top three teams went down the right route initially.
F1 Trivia: Why Are Formula 1 Drivers Weighed Following a Race?, https://the12thman.in/f1-trivia-why-are-formula-1-drivers-weighed-following-a-race/, Drivers are under tremendous stresses and stress over the course of a Grand Prix weekend. Why are Formula 1 drivers weighed following a raceThe driver may feel the intense heat produced by all of these systems inside the vehicle. A driver who weighed 50 kg may compete more favorably than say a driver who weighed 80 kg because the drivers weight was not taken into account in the total. This practice has been outlawed by the regulatory body since the implementation of minimum weight regulations. Formula One returns live from the Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace for the Brazilian Grand Prix the following weekend., In order to compete at the greatest level of racing in the world one must not only be skilled behind the wheel of a Formula 1 car. But also in excellent physical condition. Drivers are under tremendous stresses and stress over the course of a Grand Prix weekend. It is due to the openwheeled aspect of the sport which focuses primarily on lap time and circuit performance. The more modern vehicles that were introduced this season can be a little bit slower than the formula from the previous year. However they may still exert upwards of 5Gs of force while braking and turning. An F1 car has little to no heat protection for the driver. He is encircled by electronics an engine and a hybrid system surrounding his cockpit. It also has to withstand greater G forces than the normal person. Why are Formula 1 drivers weighed following a race The driver may feel the intense heat produced by all of these systems inside the vehicle. A driver loses 45 kg of weight in a single race due to the physical demands of driving through curves in the heat. This makes it necessary to weigh drivers before and after a race to monitor their weight loss and make sure it stays within safe legal limits. The technological requirements that an automobile must meet are another factor that depends on the weight of the driver. A minimum of 795 kg must be carried by the 2022 standard automobile including the driver. To complete technical tests after the Grand Prix the driver needs a postrace weight record. Prior to 2019 Formula 1 teams may improve performance by using a lighter driver Before the FIA mandated that a driver and his seat must weigh a minimum of 80 kg for the competition F1 teams were spotted using a lighter driver to their advantage. A driver who weighed 50 kg may compete more favorably than say a driver who weighed 80 kg because the drivers weight was not taken into account in the total. This practice has been outlawed by the regulatory body since the implementation of minimum weight regulations. It urges drivers to maintain a healthy body mass index. After a week off following the doubleheaders in the United States of America and Mexico. Formula One returns live from the Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace for the Brazilian Grand Prix the following weekend. Max Verstappen has already won the title therefore it is unclear who will take the second slot on the list. Sergio Perez and Charles Leclerc are vying for it.

OPINION: Verstappen and Red Bull don't get enough credit what they are doing is remarkable, https://racingnews365.com/opinion-verstappen-and-red-bull-dont-get-enough-credit-what-they-are-doing-is-remarkable, When Max Verstappen crossed the line at the end of the Mexican Grand Prix he did something no other driver has ever done in the history of Formula 1. It was found that Red Bull went over the 145 million budget cap for 2021 which on the face of it would suggest they gained an unfair advantage. Red Bull are the only privateer team capable of winning races in F1. Hes previously overstepped the line with his rogue marshal comments during qualifying for the 2021 Qatar Grand Prix. But hes got it right this time  Verstappen and Red Bull are unfairly being treated., When Max Verstappen crossed the line at the end of the Mexican Grand Prix he did something no other driver has ever done in the history of Formula 1. It was his 14th win in a single season surpassing the record previously held by Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel. By comparison Lewis Hamilton has only ever reached 11 wins in a season during 2014 which was matched again in 18 19 and 20. After the long period of Mercedes dominance 2022 was the time to show what Verstappen has been waiting for ever since he became F1s youngest race winner on his Red Bull debut at the Spanish Grand Prix in 2016. There were races that year which showed how ruthless he could be with the established order of drivers an example of which being the rainsoaked Brazilian Grand Prix. It was a stunning performance highlighted by the outrageous overtaking move around the outside of soontobe World Champion Nico Rosberg in the tricky conditions. At that time the talk of him being a future World Champion was ripe. So now that weve got to this point why has he suddenly become the pantomime villain  XPBimages Horner is right to point out mental health effects of cost cap saga The 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix wasnt a conventional ending for a season to say the least but Verstappen still proved his worth as a champion by winning nine other races prior to the finale. For some this championship still has an asterisk which was fuelled even more by this seasons cost cap story. It was found that Red Bull went over the 145 million budget cap for 2021 which on the face of it would suggest they gained an unfair advantage. If one examines the details the team were actually under the budget cap by 4 million and the overspend was due to a disputed amount relating to four key areas. The FIA themselves confirmed the team did not act fraudulently or in bad faith with Team Principal Christian Horner pointing out that the overspend did not amount to more performance for their car. But it didnt stop the allegations of Red Bull being branded cheaters with Horner saying the saga was having effects on the mental health of team members  and even their children. The damage that that does to the brand to our partners to our drivers to our workforce in an age where mental health is prevalent were seeing significant issues he told media including RacingNews365.com. Within our workforce we are having kids that are being bullied in playgrounds that are employees children  that is not right through fictitious allegations from other teams. The idea that Horner would gaslight members of his team to avoid criticism is abject nonsense. One has to remember that F1 teams are spending months away from their families during the everexpanding calendar in the pursuit to win races and championships. To be branded cheaters or for there to be constant digging from broadcasters at Verstappens title legitimacy is insulting to the people that are working the hours to make it happen behind the scenes. More of a concerted effort to recognise Verstappens greatness Prior to the 2021 season it was Hamilton and Mercedes who were on the receiving end of boos from the fans with Vettel and Schumacher also getting the same treatment during their years of success for simply being dominant and winning most of the races. I can remember the 2013 British Grand Prix where fans wanted anyone but Vettel to win and when he did retire in front of the grandstand I was sitting in people cheered as if Hamilton had just overtaken two cars in one corner. It is rather sad that in the very moment athletes and team personnel are achieving their lifelong ambitions  for which they have made untold sacrifices for in the pursuit of  public opinion can turn on them. Red Bull are the only privateer team capable of winning races in F1. Outside of the championship they do not really have any other income in the same way that Mercedes or Ferrari do with their car companies. If anything they are the underdogs in all this in the same way Racing Point were when they won their first race through Sergio Perez at the 2020 Sakhir Grand Prix. To an extent Red Bulls domination in 2022 is unsurprising for those that know where their strengths have always lay. Theyve always been the best chassis makers on the grid which is why neither Mercedes or Ferrari were willing to supply them with an engine when they separated from Renault during the early days of the hybrid era. That being said Horner is no angel. Hes previously overstepped the line with his rogue marshal comments during qualifying for the 2021 Qatar Grand Prix. But hes got it right this time  Verstappen and Red Bull are unfairly being treated. Verstappen will no doubt remain a perennial title contender for years to come and will continue to develop as a driver so there should be more of a concerted effort to enjoy his remarkable achievements at just 25 years old.
F1 News: Mercedes Predicts a Gloomy Outcome for the Formula One Race in Brazil Saying It Won't Be 'As Competitive ..., https://the12thman.in/f1-news-mercedes-predicts-a-gloomy-outcome-for-the-formula-one-race-in-brazil-saying-it-wont-be-as-competitive-as-mexico/, Mercedes package for the 2022 Formula One season has improved during the course of the year. Last weekends Mexican Grand Prix was a terrific day for Lewis Hamilton and George Russell.

Mercedes has been one team that has not been satisfied with its performance in the 2022 Formula One season following a period of dominance. Watch as Mercedes tries to claim the top spot on the podium in the upcoming Brazilian Grand Prix this year., Mercedes package for the 2022 Formula One season has improved during the course of the year. The Brackleybased team managed to bridge the gap or possibly exceed Ferrari despite having a slow start to the year due to porpoising. This season Red Bull Racing still appears to be the favorite coming into just about any type of circuit. But the distance between the two teams has narrowed. Last weekends Mexican Grand Prix was a terrific day for Lewis Hamilton and George Russell. He placed second and fourth respectively. At Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez both of the Mercedes vehicles were significantly faster than the Ferraris. It was with the scarlet drivers taking fifth and sixth respectively. Even though Hamilton came in 15 seconds behind Max Verstappen the Brackleybased teams struggles to make Q3 earlier in the year show that the cars progress is paying off. Mercedes predicts a gloomy outcome for the Formula One race in Brazil saying it wont be as competitive as Mexico In contrast to prior weekends the team did particularly well thanks to the high altitude of the Mexico City track. And the Mercedes W13s skill at running maximum downforce. The Toto Wolffled crew though does not appear to be as confident going into the Brazilian GP. For Mercedes a victory in the 2022 constructors championship is more desirable to Toto Wolff than P2 Silver Arrows chief strategist James Vowles commented on the causes behind it and said Although its difficult to anticipate before we arrive I dont think well be as competitive as we were last weekend. It wont be much different but a slight setback is probable. Ferrari should also be closer than it was in Mexico in my opinion. Yes the circuit is elevated above average at around 700 meters above sea level but the track configuration undoubtedly also plays a role. We perform best on tracks with significant high downforce which Brazils courses do not always have. The Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace will broadcast the 2022 Brazilian Grand Prix on November 13. Mercedes has been one team that has not been satisfied with its performance in the 2022 Formula One season following a period of dominance. The Brackleybased team appears to be striving for the top position on the podium once more while competing for P2 in the constructors title with two rounds remaining. Toto Wolff the teams chief acknowledged in media reports that he would prefer a victory this year over finishing second in the constructors standings saying A win the win would show that our car is back in the race for victories finishing P2 might also be the result of others just dropping the ball and you are getting more points the announcer said.

F1-backed female series ‘only a positive’ says W Series driver Hawkins, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/f1-female-series-positive-hawkins/10395055/, The F1backed female series would not be designed to replace W Series given it will use Formula 4 machinery and be targeted at a younger generation of drivers. W Series has used Formula 3 cars since its inaugural season in 2019. Hawkins has raced in all three seasons of W Series to date as well as serving as an ambassador for Aston Martins Formula 1 team. I also would like to think that it would work alongside W Series. W Series has helped make that happen but were just a bit later on., Listen to this article Over the United States Grand Prix weekend last month it emerged that F1 was planning to launch its own allfemale racing series as early as next year serving as a potential feeder series into Formula 3 and Formula 2. It came just weeks after W Series was forced to call off the final three rounds of its 2022 season due to fundraising issues instead turning its attention to securing back for the 2023 championship. The F1backed female series would not be designed to replace W Series given it will use Formula 4 machinery and be targeted at a younger generation of drivers. W Series has used Formula 3 cars since its inaugural season in 2019. Hawkins has raced in all three seasons of W Series to date as well as serving as an ambassador for Aston Martins Formula 1 team. Although F1 is yet to formally confirm any details for its planned series Hawkins said she can only see it as a positive as it gives more racing opportunities to women trying to get up the ladder. Any championship that helps females out I think should be welcomed and we should do everything that we can to welcome it said Hawkins. I also would like to think that it would work alongside W Series. I would hate to think they would ever be competing against each other because thats not what were fight for here. Its not whos got the best championship its how do we work together because were all trying to achieve the same thing. I think its a positive thing. Start grid Photo by Sam Bloxham  Motorsport Images Hawkins felt it was important for a greater focus on grassroots level to get more women racing helping increase the pool of drivers and had a wider impact similar to the England womens football team that won the Euro 2022 championship. The less that we have the less chance there is going to be that a female is going to be making it to Formula 1 said Hawkins. So lets address the issue get as many in as we can appeal to the younger generation get as many as we can in at grassroots level and in a few years time well see the reward of that like the Lionesses. Yes were seeing the reward of the amazing work that the current Lionesses are doing. But were actually gaining from the work that was done five 10 15 years ago. The Lionesses could have won the Euros 20 years ago but I bet no one would have heard about it. But because of the work that was done by those 20 years ago now were enjoying it and hearing about it so much. W Series has helped make that happen but were just a bit later on. Were going to see the reward of that in a few years time.

Sainz told Autosport that he would like to concentrate on the events good aspects saying Id rather concentrate on the positives because we know it was a good race for me. And finally having not raced in a month to go back in the vehicle and perform a solid race with a decent speed it was at least something nice he said.

They could only qualify in fifth and seventh place while Red Bull and Mercedes avoided contact with the opposing teams. Both Carlos Sainz and the crew were clearly having difficulties. The Spaniard said that the Scuderia was already aware of the poor speed. We are aware of the concessions we have to make for this weekend we anticipated being sluggish before the race. Instead he asserted that the speed was challenging saying Yes handling no tempo. Handling Although I was at ease and had good tyre management skills we were just too sluggish. Unfortunately in comparison to qualifying we didnt pick up any speed. Carlos Sainz placed fifth as the race began and he held that position when he crossed the finish line.

The Spaniard though is certain that his squad will be ready for the final two races of the campaign and anticipates a better outcome.

Hamilton vs Alonso: Formula 1's oldest existing rivalry, https://khelnow.com/olympic-sports/2022-10-lewis-hamilton-fernando-alonso-rivalry, Lewis Hamilton has won seven world titles while Alonso has won only twice. While the Spaniard was winning titles Lewis Hamilton was still in the GP2. Hamiltons dominance eraWith the assurance of Niki Lauda Lewis Hamilton signed for the Silver Arrow Mercedes in 2013. Alonsos F1 comeback 2021Touring the other aspects of Motorsports Alonso went for the triple crown by winning the Indy 500. While a victory is lurking in Hamilton Alonso has been a top five driver in a midfield car., Lewis Hamilton has won seven world titles while Alonso has won only twice. In what is the longest Formula 1 career of all time Fernando Alonso has rivalled some of the greatest of all. Making his debut in 2001 he rivalled the likes of Michael Schumacher Kimi Raikkonen Sebastian Vettel and Lewis Hamilton over the years. His longevity saw him racing from the Schumacher era to the Verstappen era. But of all Hamilton has been his rival for the longest time. Flashpoint 2007 Heading into 2007 Fernando Alonso had won two consecutive titles in two years. While the Spaniard was winning titles Lewis Hamilton was still in the GP2. Coming up from the McLarenMercedes setup he was signed up for 2007 by the Formula 1 side. He would be partnering with the doubledefending champion Alonso. That year McLaren was the frontrunner alongside Ferrari. Since Race 1 Hamilton went from strength to strength with Alonso. In the second race of the season McLaren secured a 12 in Malaysia with Alonso emerging as the race winner. The same happened in Monaco where the duo lapped the entire field except narrowing missing out Felipe Massa. With five podiums in five races Hamilton finally got his first race victory in the Canadian Grand Prix. In the following race United States Grand Prix he won again. With Alonso finishing behind him. Things then started getting tense in the garage. Like any other world champion Alonso didnt like getting defeated by his teammate that too rookie. In the qualifying in Hungary Alonso blocked Hamilton in the pit lane. As both the McLarens were fighting for the pole Alonso stalled him just for enough time that Lewis didnt get the final run. However despite getting the pole Alonso was demoted by 5place and Hamilton got the pole. He eventually won the race. They fought furiously and vied for the title producing numeral moments to look back to. However Kimi Rikknen stole it from both of them and won the title in the race by one point. At the end of the season Alonso left McLarenMercedes and went back to Renault. Hamilton stayed on. In 2008 he edged Massa by one point in the last lap and won his first of many championship titles. While Alonso remained sixth in an incompetent Renault. 20102013 Different cars toptier Fernando The duo didnt get to rival each other on a frequent basis since then. Moving to Ferrari in 2010 Alonso finally had another chance to put himself up for the title fight. The 251815 points format was introduced that year. Despite that only 16 points separated the top four. The race went down to the last lap and Vettel won his first championship. Alonso ended up four points too short. While Hamilton completed the season with 240 points 12 behind Alonso. Alonso once again failed to touch the title in 2012 when Vettel just ended up three points ahead of him. Alonso finally moved on to McLaren in 2015. But his stint at Ferrari goes down in history. What makes it the most magical is that Ferrari wasnt supposed to be that high. Despite McLaren being a much more competitive car Alonso defeated Hamilton every single year from 2010 to 2013. However the bigger picture for the Spaniard was Vettel not him. Hamiltons dominance era With the assurance of Niki Lauda Lewis Hamilton signed for the Silver Arrow Mercedes in 2013. There has been no stopping the Brit since then. But on the other side things got opposite and terribly downhill for Alonso. He went back to McLaren in 2015. While Hamilton was making record after record Alonso could not catch a break from his troubles at McLaren. He eventually retired from Formula 1 in 2018. Brimming with sportsmanship Hamilton and Vettel celebrated Alonsos spectacular career with a donut show in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Producing one of the most wholesome photographs of all time. Alonsos F1 comeback 2021 Touring the other aspects of Motorsports Alonso went for the triple crown by winning the Indy 500. However his engine said no. He made a comeback to Formula 1 in 2021. Renault was rebranded as Alpine that year. Alonso replaced the outgoing Daniel Ricciardo. This was the year Red Bull was finally ready to put Verstappen in the title fight. While he and Hamilton fought for the title Alonso weaved his magic in instances. The most famous of which came at the Hungaroring when he held off his eternal rival for around 10 laps to give his teammate Esteban Ocon his firstever F1 win. In a dramatic Hungary GP Hamilton was on course to win the race. After a weird turn of events it was somehow Ocon who was the frontrunner. But given the sheer pace of Mercedes Hamilton had a clear run to win the race. But Alonso defended with all his might and Hamilton remained around 2.74 seconds short of the victory. The duo still battle it out on track. While a victory is lurking in Hamilton Alonso has been a top five driver in a midfield car. Mercedes woes have motivated Hamilton even more while Alonso has signed a multiyear deal with Aston Martin. Being 37 and 41 respectively both Hamilton and Alonso are set to commit to a few more years of Formula 1 racing.

Grosjean Says Verstappen Has Changed To 'Stay More Within The Limits', https://wtf1.com/post/grosjean-says-verstappen-has-changed-to-stay-more-within-the-limits/, Where Verstappen has been criticised in the past is for his aggressive driving style and this was placed firmly under the spotlight during his seasonlong battle with Lewis Hamilton for the 2021 title. While recovering from a poor pitstop and following Kimi Raikkonen through the field the flying Dutchman came across the back of Grosjean. Nowadays Grosjean holds no grudges about the incident instead hailing the quite extraordinary pace Verstappen has set since joining the grid. And while Grosjean was able to largely shake off that reputation over his time in F1 hes caused a stir at times during his second year in IndyCar this year. Has Verstappens driving changed or is he just in dire need of more competition in 2023, Max Verstappen has looked unstoppable this year. The fiery Dutchman has always been fast but hes now fully realising his potential dominating races and breaking records left right and centre with the help of Red Bulls RB18. Where Verstappen has been criticised in the past is for his aggressive driving style and this was placed firmly under the spotlight during his seasonlong battle with Lewis Hamilton for the 2021 title. Any fan that watched last year or has witnessed the Twitter fallout since will be able to tell you that the pair constantly clashed with Verstappens uncompromising style contributing depending on who you ask to a Saudi Arabian shunt and big crashes at Monza and Silverstone. However speaking earlier this week on Skys Any Driven Monday F1 veteran Romain Grosjean suggested that the 25yearold has become calmer this season and doesnt push the limits as much as he did. Since his world championship hes gotten more at peace explained Grosjean. He drives the way he does which is a very engaged way of driving which I love. But he just stays more within the limits than he would have done in the past. In his Lotus Renault days the Frenchman actually had a runin with Verstappen himself at the 2015 Monaco Grand Prix during Verstappens rookie F1 season. While recovering from a poor pitstop and following Kimi Raikkonen through the field the flying Dutchman came across the back of Grosjean. When he tried to overtake him into Turn 1 Verstappen caused a huge crash hitting the Lotus rear and spearing into the barriers. Nowadays Grosjean holds no grudges about the incident instead hailing the quite extraordinary pace Verstappen has set since joining the grid. But in terms of style the nowIndyCar driver said F1s twotime world champion has learned and adapted. Max wouldnt do that today. Thats something Max has learned and its normal said Grosjean. Max had a very fast career through the singleseaters he came into Formula 1 super early. But you can have all the preparation you want Formula 1 is different. Of course Grosjean is one of the drivers best placed to talk about this topic having been no stranger to receiving criticism for his racing style. He came under fire during his fulltime rookie F1 season in 2012 where he received a race ban for some quite frankly dangerous driving including causing a major opening lap shunt at the 2012 Belgian GP. And while Grosjean was able to largely shake off that reputation over his time in F1 hes caused a stir at times during his second year in IndyCar this year. Ferraris Carlos Sainz said he wants to make things more complicated for the Dutchman in 2023. If F1s Smooth Operator can manage this and if Ferrari can deliver the car for Charles Leclerc and him then maybe then well know just how much Verstappen has changed  especially if Mercedes can rejoin the fight too Has Verstappens driving changed or is he just in dire need of more competition in 2023

Norris Eyeing Up Future Opportunities to Race Outside F1, https://wtf1.com/post/norris-eyeing-up-future-opportunities-to-race-outside-f1/, Lando Norris has been a man in demand in 2022. On that occasion Norris hopes of longdistance racing glory went up in smoke as his LMP2 race car suffered mechanical issues. However the young Brit has now suggested that this experience has whetted his appetite to sample more racing outside of F1. I would love to drive more I would love to get more opportunities Norris told Racer. Would you like to see F1 drivers dabble in other racing series offseason, Lando Norris has been a man in demand in 2022. Not only has he raised his stock by outperforming teammate Daniel Ricciardo in another impressive F1 campaign but the Brit revealed this week that he had spoken to Red Bull before resigning for McLaren. Agreed earlier this year the renewal is set to keep Lando in a papaya race suit until 2025 but it appears that hes already got his eyes peeled for chances to compete elsewhere in the years to come. In 2018 the McLaren man took part in the 24 Hours of Daytona with fellow F1 star Fernando Alonso and veteran endurance racer Phil Hanson for Zak Browns United Autosports team. On that occasion Norris hopes of longdistance racing glory went up in smoke as his LMP2 race car suffered mechanical issues. However the young Brit has now suggested that this experience has whetted his appetite to sample more racing outside of F1. I would love to drive more I would love to get more opportunities Norris told Racer. Formula 1 is my life at the minute I understand that. But doing the Daytona 24 hours and things like that I would love to do and Im sure in maybe 10 or 20 years I will have that opportunity or more opportunities to do it. Given that F1s new record 24race calendar is set to put the endurance of Lando and all his fellow drivers to the test next year he says downtime will be at a premium. Understandably when he does get a break the 22yearold expects hell just want to go away and forget about Formula 1 before coming back to it and he doesnt plan on racing in other series alongside F1. On the other hand with McLaren venturing into series like IndyCar and his teammate recently getting to demo a NASCAR he says he has started thinking about other vehicles hed like to drive. He Ricciardo got to drive the number three Dale Earnhardt car I dont really have anyone Ive looked up to like Daniel and Earnhardt he added. Maybe Ill try a motorbike but I probably wouldnt be able to come back to four wheels if I went motorbiking because Id crash For the time being Lando says hes committed to F1. That said hes got plenty of time left in his career to try out other categories. Maybe MotoGP should be off the cards though.  Would you like to see F1 drivers dabble in other racing series offseason
Formula 1 may be getting a new winter break period, https://sixsports.in/formula-1-may-be-getting-a-new-winter-break-period/, A summer break is already present in Formula 1 taking into account the long and tiring seasons. Now however another break period is also recommended. Formula Ones Sporting Advisory Committee is believed to be discussing another break period during the winters after the end of the season. The rules of the winter break are expected to be similar to summer break. But there was a positive indication for the wellbeing of the people.The new winter break could very well be the answer to the negative impacts of a very long F1 season., Formula 1 can be tedious at times and the upcoming season will only increase the workload on everyone involved. A summer break is already present in Formula 1 taking into account the long and tiring seasons. All factories are shut down during the period. This ensures that every team and its staff get welldeserved time off. Further the sport is going to witness its longest season ever in 2023 with recordbreaking 24 races. Now however another break period is also recommended. Formula Ones Sporting Advisory Committee is believed to be discussing another break period during the winters after the end of the season. The rules of the winter break are expected to be similar to summer break. It is most likely to commence around the Christmas and New year weeks. However the talks are yet to reach the advanced stage and it is believed that not all the teams have agreed on it yet. Mercedes Formula 1 Team boss Toto Wolff has provided some insight into the development of this proposal. He is optimistic and welcoming to the new change and hopes every team agrees on it. There are many of us team principals that would like to replicate what we have in the summer at least starting at Christmas and going into the new year for two weeks. Wolff added Obviously thats still up for discussion. But there was a positive indication for the wellbeing of the people. The new winter break could very well be the answer to the negative impacts of a very long F1 season. The 24race calendar can become boring for not only the drivers but for the team as a whole.

The one F1 record Verstappen will not be able to break in 2022, https://racingnews365.com/the-one-f1-record-verstappen-will-not-be-able-to-break-in-2022, With 14 Formula 1 Grand Prix wins and counting in the 2022 season Max Verstappen is in uncharted territory. However while this record is certainly attainable there is one that Verstappen will not be able to claim  no matter what he does. The record Verstappen cant break With the F1 calendar expanding in recent years the total number of race wins in a season has become an easier target. However Ascaris score is set to remain unbeatable to have beaten his tally Verstappen would have needed 17 wins from the season. In the first 10 seasons of the World Championship F1 drivers didnt bother with a trip to Indiana but in 1952 Ascari did just that with Ferrari., With 14 Formula 1 Grand Prix wins and counting in the 2022 season Max Verstappen is in uncharted territory. His win in the Mexican Grand Prix eclipsed the tally of 13 victories  the record jointly held by Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel  as the Red Bull driver continued to impose his dominance on the campaign. He can potentially claim the largest margin between P1 and P2 in the Drivers Championship with his gap to Sergio Perez currently standing at 136 points. The alltime record is 155 points held by Vettel in his 2013 campaign over Fernando Alonso meaning that Verstappen needs to outscore Perez by 20 points in the final two race weekends. However while this record is certainly attainable there is one that Verstappen will not be able to claim  no matter what he does. The record Verstappen cant break With the F1 calendar expanding in recent years the total number of race wins in a season has become an easier target. Mick Schumacher even said after Mexico that he expected his fathers record to be beaten given the fact that there are more races these days than compared to Michaels era. With that in mind the metric of total percentage wins in a season has become more useful to measure a drivers success. However despite winning 14 of 20 races in 2022 and potentially even 16 of 22 Verstappen will fall short of taking a record that has stood since 1952  the third year of the World Championship  as the table below shows. Highest driver win percentages Year Driver Races Wins Percentage wins 1952 Alberto Ascari 8 6 75 2004 Michael Schumacher 18 13 72.22 1963 Jim Clark 10 7 70 2022 Max Verstappen 20 14  up to Mexican GP 70 2013 Sebastian Vettel 19 13 68.42 1954 Juan Manuel Fangio 9 6 66.67 2002 Michael Schumahcer 17 11 64.71 2020 Lewis Hamilton 17 11 64.71 Verstappens tally As it stands with 14 wins from 20 races Verstappen has a 70 win rate. Should he take victories in Brazil and Abu Dhabi for a score of 16 from 22 this will climb to 72.72  and move him into second on the list behind Alberto Ascaris record of 75 from 1952. However Ascaris score is set to remain unbeatable to have beaten his tally Verstappen would have needed 17 wins from the season. Ascaris record is also unique as he also competed in the Indy 500 that year. In the first 10 seasons of the World Championship F1 drivers didnt bother with a trip to Indiana but in 1952 Ascari did just that with Ferrari. As a result he missed the seasonopener in May 1952 in Switzerland before finishing 31st in the 500 itself. Upon returning to the F1 scene he would not be beaten across the rest of the season winning all six races from the Belgian Grand Prix.

He comes in and slots in he knows what to expect. And from my side Ive just tried to be as welcoming and include him  trying to communicate a lot about the car what can I test what can you test to get us to point A I just try to work with him as I did with Valtteri Bottas. When you add new people it takes time to all get into the rhythm but I think hes done an amazing job we got into a decent rhythm quite early on and were continuing to work out any kinks there to continue to be on that rhythm. Hamilton has vowed to return to the title fight in 2023 and challenge Max Verstappen again.

Ferrari: Mercedes’ development rate not a worry for F1 2023, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/ferrari-mercedes-development-rate-not-a-worry-for-f1-2023/10395092/, While the Italian squad started the 2022 season as the team to beat it eventually lost out to the fastrecovering Red Bull team which has claimed both the drivers and constructors championship titles. More recently Mercedes has emerged as Red Bulls main threat at some races with Ferraris F175 particularly lacking performance last time out in Mexico. That could leave Ferrari facing another season of disappointment having failed to capitalise on having the best package at the start of this year. We know as well ourselves that we stopped quite early the development of that car to focus on 2023. Since then Red Bull has won every grand prix., While the Italian squad started the 2022 season as the team to beat it eventually lost out to the fastrecovering Red Bull team which has claimed both the drivers and constructors championship titles. More recently Mercedes has emerged as Red Bulls main threat at some races with Ferraris F175 particularly lacking performance last time out in Mexico. This has come with Mercedes overcoming the early bouncing problems that plagued its W13 and being able to finally unlock the potential it knew was always in the car. Mercedes progress points to the team being back in contention for wins next year as it looks poised to switch some key concepts of its challenger. That could leave Ferrari facing another season of disappointment having failed to capitalise on having the best package at the start of this year. But Ferrari team principal Binotto thinks the current competitive picture between his outfit and Mercedes does not reflect the true situation for next year as Maranello switched off development of its 2022 car early to shift its focus to next year. Mercedes is coming back right as they have developed the car more than we did he said after Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc finished fifth and sixth in Mexico. We know as well ourselves that we stopped quite early the development of that car to focus on 2023. So Im not too concerned by the rate of development because I know as well when we stopped developing it. Ferrari has not won a race since the Austrian Grand Prix in July when Leclerc came through to beat Max Verstappen. Since then Red Bull has won every grand prix.

Certainly if I look at the last races it has not always been great but in Singapore I think we have been very competitive he said. Japan was in the wet and we were not as fast but it was not a drama and certainly not in the quali. In the States Austin I think that in the quali we were competitive but not as much as we would have expected in the race. In Mexico its a lot worse but I dont think its the same trend because Singapore competitive Japan not too bad USA good quali. But the duty is first to try to analyse whats going on and what has been the main issues here in Mexico and try to be back competitive for what is our level of competitiveness at least for the last two races including Sao Paulo. So we hope certainly to be there and to fight for a better result.
‘There’s no limit to what we can do’ – Hamilton on fighting back ‘best friend’ Wolff and changing the world, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.theres-no-limit-to-what-we-can-do-hamilton-on-fighting-back-best-friend.6G5Be1bYJ4AzCkYAmrv0BH.html, I cant tell you what that is just yet but there is no limit to what we can do. I get to be myself at this team  and the support from Mercedes has been incredible since day one. Toto Wolff Mercedes Team Principal is one of my best friends. Its with that in mind Hamilton is focusing on all the details he can control  and working with the team to drive them forward. Hamilton remains as motivated as ever to claim what would be a recordbreaking eighth world title, Lewis Hamilton is a force of nature. The Briton has had the most challenging 12 months of his career a period which began with missing out on what would have been a record eighth world title on the final lap of the final race of 2021 and could end with him enduring the first winless campaign of his illustrious career. And yet he is not letting it get him down. Rather than pondering an exit and calling it quits the losses are only serving to reenergise him as he considers the next chapter. READ MORE Hamilton targeting multiyear contract renewal with Mercedes In terms of my physical wellbeing I feel the best Ive physically ever been because Ive been really focused on that as you get older says Hamilton when we sit down before lunch in the Mercedes motorhome. Im generally loving driving so Im working on a plan. I cant tell you what that is just yet but there is no limit to what we can do. I want to be creative and continue to do all the other things I get to do. I get to be myself at this team  and the support from Mercedes has been incredible since day one. Together its not just about winning we can be part of the many people in the world that are trying to change the world for the better  and thats what we can try and do together as its a huge brand that can have a huge influence on the world. Hamilton is determined to leave his mark on and off the track Given Hamilton is in his happy place with Mercedes its no surprise he is in talks to extend his stay at the Silver Arrows with a multiyear deal. The 37yearold is currently in his 10th season with the Mercedes works team and 16th in total in F1 as the German manufacturer supplied power to Hamiltons first team McLaren. Extending given they give him so much freedom  from what he wears to what he does away from the track  and support particularly on causes that hes keen to use his platform to give a voice to makes sense. READ MORE We know where we need to improve says Hamilton after P2 in Mexico He also gets on well with the boss too. Toto Wolff Mercedes Team Principal is one of my best friends. Weve had tough tough times weve had tough negotiations theres been emotional bursts a rollercoaster of emotions together over the years but were like family. I want whats best for him. He wants what is best for me. We always can jump on the phone and talk about whatever that is. Our values are aligned and our goals are aligned  in the brand in helping this team grow and what it wants to achieve. Hamilton has formed a close relationship with Wolff over the years Hamilton has quickly formed a strong partnership with his team mate George Russell a Mercedes junior who earned promotion after three years at Williams including a super sub performance for Hamilton at Mercedes in Bahrain back in 2020. It could have been awkward the young pretender coming in alongside the veteran one year after his run of utter domination came to an end courtesy of Max Verstappen and Red Bull. But instead faced with the least competitive Silver Arrows car Brackley and Brixworth have produced since the hybrid turbo era began they have worked together for the greater good  with Hamilton playing an active role helping his fellow Briton hit the ground running. In terms of George joining he was one of the younger drivers here  he would sit behind in debriefs and engineering so he knows the process and the lay of the land here says Hamilton. READ MORE In hindsight its always easier  Wolff defends Mercedes Mexico strategy as wait for 2022 win goes on He comes in and slots in he knows what to expect. And from my side Ive just tried to be as welcoming and include him  trying to communicate a lot about the car what can I test what can you test to get us to point A I just try to work with him as I did with Valtteri. When you add new people it takes time to all get into the rhythm but I think hes done an amazing job we got into a decent rhythm quite early on and were continuing to work out any kinks there to continue to be on that rhythm. Hamilton and Russell have combined to score 15 podiums so far this season despite Mercedes struggles The longer Hamilton has been in F1 the more hes found stuff to do away from the sport  from setting up his own foundation Mission 44 to help young people from underrepresented background to becoming a coowner for NFL team Denver Broncos. But rather than taking his eye off the main prize in trying to achieve the balance hes actively enhanced his approach to tackling a race weekend at track to ensure the day job doesnt suffer and remains top priority. I shifted my weekend rhythm from years ago he says. These four days Thursday through to race day on Sunday Im only here for one reason. Thats not how you speak in the media or its not how youre seen but its how you show up its the work youre doing on track how youre driving on the track how you get the car to be the best it can be and how you can be the best you can be. PALMER Could Mercedes have beaten Verstappen in Mexico City with bolder calls from the pit wall So I try to use up all the time and the quietest part of the day particularly is the end of the day as no one is around and thats where I have no distractions. I can go through the data  and Im in constant contact with the simulation team back at the factory so while that is running Im able to have live interactions with the driver who is driving there. Hamilton and Mercedes are still pushing for their first win of 2022 having come close in the United States and Mexico I eat at the track and then Im depleted once I finish. Im starting to wind down at the end head back to the hotel and then its a short time between going to sleep and waking up  so thats what I like. I dont want to finish here early and go to dinner. I have no desire to go to dinner and waste time yapping. Im here for one reason thats to win races. That dinner and other events not linked to racing during a race weekend for me is all the distraction so I dont do that very often  if ever. To win races though Mercedes will need to turn things around for next year after a difficult season that has left the Silver Arrows trailing Red Bull and Ferrari by quite some way. TREMAYNE Mercedes resurgence means we could be in for a thrilling end to 2022 Positively for Hamilton and co they have closed the gap in recent races  pulling themselves into the fight for victory at both Austin and Mexico  but the seventime world champion knows they still have plenty to do if they are to recapture the form that led to Mercedes dominating F1 from 2014 to 2020. Its with that in mind Hamilton is focusing on all the details he can control  and working with the team to drive them forward. Hamilton remains as motivated as ever to claim what would be a recordbreaking eighth world title

Ricciardo reveals help from psychologist - “I was neglecting friendships”, https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1016199/1/ricciardo-reveals-help-psychologist-i-was-neglecting-friendships, The veteran Australian has now revealed how his ontrack struggles followed him in his personal life too.  F1 2022 Video of Daniel Ricciardo  WHERE NEXT  F1 2022Whenever we thought we would found a solution along would come another set of challenges he told the Daily Mail. I was neglecting friendships and thought it would be good to talk to someone to make sure the two sides of my life didnt cross over. It would be good to get next year sorted before the final race in Abu Dhabi he said., Ricciardo wont be in the F1 2023 driver lineup after McLaren opted to terminate his contract a year early and replace him with rookie Oscar Piastri as a result of his poor form. The veteran Australian has now revealed how his ontrack struggles followed him in his personal life too. Daniel Ricciardo  WHERE NEXT  F1 2022 Video of Daniel Ricciardo  WHERE NEXT  F1 2022 Whenever we thought we would found a solution along would come another set of challenges he told the Daily Mail. When you put so much into something and it doesnt work out there is sadness. It gets to you. Last year it affected me a little bit too much. I wouldnt be my usual bubbly self. I would be reluctant if someone said lets go out for dinner. I would need some cajoling. I let it get to me. I started to speak to a psychologist last year. The most challenging year I have had. Racing is very much results driven and dictates your Sunday happiness. I was neglecting friendships and thought it would be good to talk to someone to make sure the two sides of my life didnt cross over. You need perspective. And with the calendar being so long it was hard to remove yourself from what was happening in the racing. Ricciardo is 12th in the F1 standings after being drastically outperformed by Lando Norris in 2022. McLaren opted not to keep him for 2023 and he has not found an agreement to stay on the grid with another team. It is fair to say it was unexpected given I was on a threeyear deal that had a year to run he said about McLarens decision. It is not something you can prepare for. But Id already had some honest discussions with Andreas Seidl team principal and Zak Brown chief executive earlier in the year to see what we could do to improve things. It was a concern on both sides. I didnt want to keep coming 14th or 15th. I kept the faith that something would click. But it hadnt happened by midseason and they took the decision they did. It put me in a tough position of thinking What next Ricciardo has confirmed that he remains in talks with F1 teams about a different role reportedly as a reserve driver. He has been heavily linked with Mercedes as backup to Lewis Hamilton and George Russell. It would be good to get next year sorted before the final race in Abu Dhabi he said.

The seat became available after Alonso elected to make a switch to Aston Martin with Oscar Piastri set to be his replacement. However following a lengthy contract dispute Piastri will now race with rivals McLaren which meant a seat had been available at the team.

But who knows you know everything happens for a reason maybe now Ill be more ready than ever when that time comes. Its good to know that I do have the support from the team to know that I can be branched out if that werent the case and if the opportunity came available.
Lewis Hamilton snubbed again as Sebastian Vettel changes his mind on F1 GOAT debate, https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/f1-goat-hamilton-schumacher-vettel-28414447, Michael is my hero for that reason I probably dont want Lewis to win he said last December. In a way I would be happy if Michaels record still stands but even if Lewis wins to me Michael is still the greatest. Lewis can win one more two more three more five more championships  it doesnt change anything for me. Asked again for his verdict on that most controversial of questions Vettel now believes the GOAT to be fivetime champion Juan Manuel Fangio. Im a fan of Michael Schumacher but Fangio is a little better... the best the best the king said Vettel., Vettel previously named Michael Schumacher as the best F1 driver of all time in his opinion but it seems he has since changed his mind while still ignoring Hamilton Sebastian Vettel has changed his mind on who he believes to be the Formula 1 GOAT  but like last time he avoided choosing Lewis Hamilton. The fourtime world champion knows more than most what it takes to be among the F1 elite. Vettel will retire later this month as one of the most decorated racers the sport has ever seen boasting 53 race wins and 112 podiums as well as those four consecutive drivers titles. Last year on the eve of the titledeciding Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Vettel made it clear who he believed to be the greatest driver the sport has ever seen. No matter whether or not Hamilton got the better of Max Verstappen last year he still advocated for his countryman Michael Schumacher. Michael is my hero for that reason I probably dont want Lewis to win he said last December. But the truth is they both had a strong season and they are going into the last race with the opportunity to win the championship because they both deserve it. In a way I would be happy if Michaels record still stands but even if Lewis wins to me Michael is still the greatest. Lewis can win one more two more three more five more championships  it doesnt change anything for me. Those comments made clear his unwavering belief in that point of view but it seems something may have changed over the last 12 months. Asked again for his verdict on that most controversial of questions Vettel now believes the GOAT to be fivetime champion Juan Manuel Fangio. Image Mirrorpix Mirrorpix The Argentine competed in a vastly different era of the sport winning 24 races in 51 starts on the way to five world championships in the 1950s. Im a fan of Michael Schumacher but Fangio is a little better... the best the best the king said Vettel. The German also went on to give his verdict on Verstappen who may well enter the GOAT debate one day after romping to 2022 title  the second of his career  aged 25. I think hes had a hell of a season so hopefully he goes on and get 16 wins by the end of the year because anything else will be a disappointment Vettel added. It is great for Red Bull and I still know some people there so I am really happy for them. Obviously they have a lot of momentum from last year and the car this year is incredible. They won races even though they were heavier than anybody else and I think now theyve finally got the weight out. So the car is there but Max is doing an amazing job as well.

failed yet fruitful Alpine F1 seat pitch that began on Instagram, https://the-race.com/formula-1/the-failed-yet-fruitful-alpine-2023-pitch-that-began-on-instagram/, Jack Doohan has not managed to get an Alpine Formula 1 drive for 2023. And while Alpine has unsurprisingly gone for a more experienced option for its 2023 race seat in Pierre Gasly Doohans efforts have still been worthwhile. So I actually sent him a DM on Instagram  basically this huge big long paragraph saying why I think I could be a candidate going forward. He took his first feature race win at Spa  which was the sort of message ontrack that he was telegraphing to Alpine offtrack. At that point in time ninth in Formula 2 and not really in a position to go to Formula 1., Jack Doohan has not managed to get an Alpine Formula 1 drive for 2023. But its not for the lack of trying. F1s newest free practice debutant is now frontandcentre in Alpines junior programme following the messy Oscar Piastri saga. Doohan had more nerves chasing Alpine seat than FP1 debut Read more That might have seemed like a natural progression given he was the highestplaced Alpine protege in the junior ranks when it became clear Piastri would be leaving the team but whatever it owes to circumstance it owes an equal amount to Doohans impressive proactivity. From sending Alpine CEO Laurent Rossi direct messages on social media to emailing Alpines lead engineer on the first weekend after the summer break Doohan did all he could to shape his own destiny. And while Alpine has unsurprisingly gone for a more experienced option for its 2023 race seat in Pierre Gasly Doohans efforts have still been worthwhile. On the night that all that news broke I didnt have Laurents number or anything Doohan says. So I actually sent him a DM on Instagram  basically this huge big long paragraph saying why I think I could be a candidate going forward. And he replied at like 3am  I think he was in the US or somewhere  with his number at the bottom and that wed chat in the coming days. Then I think I spoke to Otmar Szafnauer the following night briefly. And every day I was kind of trying to speak to whoever I can in all parts of the Formula 1 team and all parts of the structure for the Academy. It was an opportunity and even if it was a farfetched one at least now with the seat closed off and Pierre taking it I know that Im not sitting here going I wish I pushed a little bit more I wish I tried. Alonsos 2022 misery has a silver lining  but not for him Read more For a solid six weeks I was doing absolutely everything I can to try and secure myself in the seat. Sure it didnt work out as hoped. But it had its upsides. Doohan was only ninth in Formula 2 heading into F1s summer break. He took his first feature race win at Spa  which was the sort of message ontrack that he was telegraphing to Alpine offtrack. If hed been off Alpines radar before August the team quickly discovered how serious Doohan was. It has been impressed by how he conducted himself and the way he behaved certainly didnt hurt his chances of replacing Piastri in the Friday practice sessions Alpine had lined up for its reserve driver. In Doohans words good things came out of it. After making his pitch to Alpines most senior figures he sought to embed himself in the team more which also aided his Formula 2 campaign. It had flickered into life just before the summer break but has enjoyed a sustained improvement since everything kicked off at Alpine at the start of August even if some circumstances have stopped Doohan from turning that into as many points as he should have. Whats going on with Piastris Alpine F1 exit Read more From the moment it all happened I was pushing on every aspect that I could to try and secure a position in Formula 1 Doohan says. And as we got to Spa I was speaking with the team as well. At that point in time ninth in Formula 2 and not really in a position to go to Formula 1. And the guys were saying its probably highly unlikely well focus on Formula 2. On Friday morning at Spa I emailed the chief engineer Ciaron Pilbeam and I said do you mind if I sit in on the preFP1 briefing And he said yeah for sure. I started from there kind of embedding myself more into the team and really trying to understand how the weekend falls into place and and basically trying to take in as much information as I can. Honestly I think when I was coming back to Formula 2 things were just so much more simple. The information coming from engineer to driver and everything that I was taking in was so much less. I think that was helping me as well. I saw that I had an opportunity to go to Formula 1. So I was going if I just enjoy this and it happens I do have a chance here. Whereas before I was obviously behind Oscar and it was maybe looking more like a twoyear project. Why Alpine thinks Gaslys a better fit than Alonso or Piastri Read more It still might be in the sense Doohan is heading for a second year in Formula 2. But if thats the case it will be with the knowledge he is at the front of the Alpine queue having made a real impression on the people in charge and has developed into a driver who will start 2023 as the title favourite. From how he conducted himself during the peak of the Piastri saga to his preparation for his FP1 debut in Mexico and his general offtrack attitude Doohans earned plenty of plaudits internally at Alpine. Team principal Otmar Szafnauer says Doohans preparation was exemplary going in wanting to know everything before Mexico and sporting director Alan Permane reckons Doohans character might prove to be an ace up the sleeve. What impresses me most about Jack honestly is out of the car says Permane. His preparation the work he does behind the scenes. Hed never driven here and there hadnt been a plan for him to drive here. And a few weeks ago he was in Brisbane doing some F2 sponsor commitments and we told him he was going to be driving in Mexico. He flew back to the UK did a day in the sim and then came onwards to Austin and here. So thats what impresses me most  his preparation. Theres no doubt about his speed. When he makes it to Formula 1 thatll be a nice differentiator for him.

It was brought in at the Spanish Grand Prix the fifth race of the 2003 season. Chassis 229 is by far the most successful of the six F2003GAs that were built. Schumacher drove it to victory in Spain and also won the Austrian Canadian Italian and US Grands Prix in the car. He also claimed pole position in Spain Austria and Italy in the car and the fastest laps in Austria Italy and the United States. The car powered Schumacher to his sixth F1 title  a total that saw the German overtake the five won by Argentinas Juan Manuel Fangio in the 1950s.

Like millions of new F1 fans Sam and I started watching Netflixs Drive to Survive in early lockdowns., You will hear a Formula 1 car before you see it. You will feel it before you see it. Theres almost a sense of foreshadowing of air being sucked back down the track. The highpitched scream rises eats into your eardrums until suddenly in a visceral release it rockets past. Neeeuuummm Instantly its gone again like a fighter jet on rails. F1 cars are so fast so low to the ground the drivers head is at roughly hip height its breathtaking. If a couple race past together a drivers exhaust sparks or someone locks up the brakes the whiff of fuel and rubber follows on a trailing wind. Its sport Jim but not as Ive known it.

But walking into Italys fabled Monza circuit with my 12yearold son Sam the reality blows that away. We first hear the roars outside the park. As we move closer to our stand in a sea of Ferrari Red and Red Bull blue the noise swells. Practice is underway a helicopter flies overhead and the cars are milling around the Autodromo Nazionale Monza at up to 347kmh. Stepping through the gigantic steel bleachers we see the track on the other side of a fence  astonishingly what feels like a few metres away. A F1 car flies by with such volume and pace I wince and take a step back. Theres another. And another. Then an extra energy ripples through the crowd. A bright red car approaches. Its Charles Leclercs Ferrari and fans go ballistic. He thunders past the tifosi and they react like football supporters whose team has scored a matchwinning goal. And this is just a practice session.

The autodromo threads through one of Europes largest parks lots of walking is involved and its surrounded not just by grandstands but a fanzone DJs and stalls selling food drink and walletbusting merch an official baseball cap costs 60 a hoodie 180. The main event is of course Sundays race but Grands Prix stretch over three or four days including free practice sessions a qualifying hour that decides the grid starting order and a host of other races vintage car parades and sideshows in between. Its a fun friendly vibe with far more kids families and women than youd find at say a Premier League match. And the waves of red around leave little doubt that most are shouting for Ferrari. Our trip began when we couldnt travel at all. Like millions of new F1 fans Sam and I started watching Netflixs Drive to Survive in early lockdowns. When the 2020 season kicked off under empty stands we bought a sports TV subscription to watch it. The strategy the speed the crashes the characters the rivalries  we were hooked and our interest has only grown over the two seasons since. Expand Close Sam among the home crowd  Facebook Twitter Email Whatsapp Sam among the home crowd Were not alone. Around us in Monza I hear a surprising amount of Irish accents and see a couple of GAA jerseys. The epic 2021 rivalry between Red Bulls Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes which controversially came down to the last lap amped up the drama. Young fans have found young drivers like Leclerc Lando Norris and Mick Schumacher relatable. Theyre on TikTok and Insta. F1s popularity is catching fire in the lucrative US market with tickets for a new Las Vegas Grand Prix including The Strip next year starting from 500. Suddenly it seems everyone wants a piece of this sport. Of course F1 can be boring too. Theyre just going around in circles Sams sister sometimes chides. Shes right... technically. Its also true that sustainability sportswashing there are races in Saudi Arabia and Qatar for example and rule confusion threaten its credibility. But we also see scintillating speed strategy and skill within those circles. Variables like weather pit stops tyres and track differences throw up unknowns. There are only 20 drivers and they speak their minds in interviews or fits of passion or pique on team radios. Its all served up with the awesome immersiveness of modern TV. And now were in the middle of it in Monzas Temple of Speed. Its so loud Sam grins despite wearing ear plugs and overear headphones. Through it all fans mingle with hardly any agro and punters range from hardcore fans on the embankments or even climbing trees to VIP guests paying thousands for pitlane access and paddock tours.

Saturdays qualifying run is a highlight. Our seats are on the Laterale Parabolica a famous corner amidst waves of Ferrari red interspersed with the Orange Army of Dutch Verstappen fans. In the dying moments of the session Leclerc posts a scorching lap time that puts him on provisional pole. The crowd erupts. When Verstappen fails to nail a faster lap the cheers are even louder. The track is 5.79km long so we only get to see a sliver of the realtime action but big screens relay whats happening elsewhere. Its a super sporting spectacle. Im not surprised to learn sports travel packages are on the rise. Cassidy Travel with whom we travelled has already released its F1 packages for 2023 spokesperson John Spollen says they are popular as Christmas gifts and not just for petrol heads anymore. But anyone considering a Grand Prix trip needs to think about travel times the costs of food drink and transport in different destinations and factors like how familyfriendly different track layouts are what kind of walking and transfers are involved and the views your money buys in grandstands or general admission. Street circuits offer different experiences to parkland tracks for example. Venues range from Singapore to Silverstone Melbourne to Monaco. Unfortunately the experience outside of Monzas track and stands is disappointing. There are long frustrating queues for portaloos water stations and food and drink stalls. A terribly executed token system leaves us queuing for 75 minutes to buy tokens and then starting again in another line to spend them on overpriced food and water. Theres no cash cards or contactless payments no queue management and uncomfortable scrums of people at entrances exits and walkways at peak times. All of this takes place under a hot sun with the added stress of a chaotic Milan train station and odd autodromo rules  such as only being allowed to bring 500ml water bottles without caps into the festival site or having to scan tickets to exit as well as enter stands. Staff are patient but Im amazed more fans dont freak out. It definitely mars the Monza magic for us and makes the overall experience a bit... well chequered. You are not the first person to report these inconveniences to us and we regret it Federico Martegani of Monzas communications office tells me when I email afterwards. The token system was designed to reduce queues he says but we did not calculate the huge number of people on the weekend 330000 people between Friday and Sunday... an absolute record for us. We apologise for the inconvenience and this problem will certainly serve as a lesson for us to change our approach for next year. I hope so. At any rate none of this reflects on our travel agent or the ontrack action  its on the event organisers. Sam and I end the days dusty sweaty and exhausted with more than 18000 steps on my phones counter. Expand Close Entering the festival atmosphere... Photo Pl  Conghaile  Facebook Twitter Email Whatsapp Entering the festival atmosphere... Photo Pl  Conghaile But we are also elated. And when Sundays Grand Prix starts the frustration quickly fades away. We bring ice cream and sweets. There are DJs and jet flybys leaving smoke trails in green red and white. Shortly before the race drivers are paraded around in vintage openbacked cars  so close we can see their faces. The Rolex clock ticks down and the crowds cheer everything  even the guy sweeping the track who starts to move his brush in time with their roars. The anticipation is electric. When the red lights go out the grid roars into action. The first time the field passes us bunched up and competing for track position at insane speeds it comes with an exhilarating storm of noise stink of rubber and slipstream of wind think of that feeling when a train passes at full pelt on a platform. Beforehand I wondered if the reallife race could match the TV coverage. But we can see screens showing pit stops overtakes and replays hear commentary bouncing between Italian and English and relate the cars flying by to the bigger picture giving us what amounts to the best of both worlds. In that moment being trackside is thrilling. It feels like Sam and I have traced a full circle from our days watching crowdless Covidera sport in isolation to being part of the great Grand Prix circus. We are inside a sport that gave us a new bond when the world shut its engines off. In the end Ferraris drivers are beaten with Verstappen taking the chequered flag on his way to a second World Championship. The tifosi are not impressed. But soon champagne will spray and fans of all hues will spill onto this historic track. After that the travelling bank will pack up and move to the next race in Singapore. I bet they can already feel the F1 cars coming. Expand Close Spa Belgium  Facebook Twitter Email Whatsapp Spa Belgium Formula 1 travel  need to know How to get there Pl was a guest of Cassidy Travel flying to Milan from Dublin with Aer Lingus and staying at the fourstar Hotel Da Vinci. For more information on its F1 travel packages for 2023 see below or visit cassidytravel.iesportsbreaks. Spa Belgium Fournight packages with Grandstand Speed Corner tickets and a threestar hotel stay from 499pp flights extra. The Belgian Grand Prix runs from July 2730. Monza Italy The 2023 Italian Grand Prix runs from August 31 to September 3 next year. Fournight packages including flights a fourstar hotel stay and seated tickets from 675pp. Barcelona Spain A fivenight package with general admission tickets hotel accommodation and return flights starts from 999pp. The Spanish Grand Prix runs from June 14. Should I get general admission or grandstand tickets General admission is usually the cheapest ticket but its all relative  F1 is a pricey sport and tickets are typically for three days. These will allow access to general areas often at track height or raised ground around it with no fixed seats. You will need to arrive early for the best spots especially for qualifying and the Grand Prix itself and remember that the spots are not guaranteed  if you need to go to the loo for example. Grandstands are priced according to the views they offer and the chance of seeing some action  overtakes braking zones chicanes and so on. The priciest are usually opposite the pit lanes and starting grid where you will see the start of the race and the chequered flag. Hospitality tickets offering VIP access can cost many multiples of the price  running to thousands of euro. Seated tickets mean you can come and go from your spot. Its a good idea to try for an elevated view too  this can allow you to see the cars coming earlier and track them for longer. But it will depend on particular circuits the surrounding trees or buildings and so on. What to Pack for a Grand Prix Tracks differ widely in terms of layout locations facilities and weather. Research yours and its prohibited items carefully before compiling your packing list. Inevitably a lot of walking will be involved tracks can be several kilometres long. Wear comfy shoes and loose clothes. You may also need a hat shades sunscreen and a small umbrella for the sunrain as well as a few energy bars and water. A poncho or light rainjacket is handy too. Remember you will have to carry what you bring for the day so check the track rules as to what size bags are allowed and for any specific restrictions  such as the size of water bottles or sunscreen containers and whether phone battery packs or items like tripods are allowed. Ear defenders and ear plugs are a good idea especially for young fans. These can be bought around the track but will cost considerably less outside of it. Its better to have them and find you dont always need them than to regret not having them. A small pair of binoculars can be handy but the cars move so fast it can be hard to track them. A lanyard and pouch is useful to keep tickets and QR codes visible as they need to be scanned regularly to access stands  also to keep them safe. At the track Get a programme and figure out what action you want to see  the Formula 1 highlights of course but it will also include F2 races vintage parades and a surprising number of undercard races. Generally speaking concession stalls for food drink and merch are less busy during the popular track action or outside of peak times like lunch. You may also find cheaper food drink and souvenirs though not official merch outside of the festival boundaries. Be mindful of things like your phone battery and have a safety plan for kids in case you get separated. After the chequered flag some circuits allow fans onto the track for the champagne celebrations  research where this access will be and have a think about your exit and whether the crowds will be safe for families before committing. But most of all have fun More information For more on F1 see formula1.com. See also f1destinations.com and f1experiences.com.
Formula 1’s Toto Wolff accused of running his team remotely leans into software even more, https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/04/formula-1s-toto-wolff-looks-for-fresh-edge-in-2023-through-remote-software/, We really try to go through a system like we have at Formula 1 like a team. In fact Wolff said the team has cut its emissions by nearly 90 in recent years. Surely for a company promising great efficiency to its customers theres nothing like having a revered Formula 1 team boss sing your praises. Earlier this year reports Knight Horner referred to Wolff who lives in Monaco as a tax exile who  he added disparagingly  runs his team remotely. Wolff in conversation with Knight said of Horner in turn Hes just so simple., Toto Wolff the 50yearold Austrian chief executive team principal and partowner of the Mercedes Formula 1 team who was recently described by The New Yorker as someone who might breeze past you in the airport smelling good wearing loafers and no socks talked openly yesterday about his teams terrible nogood year. Sitting with Oliver Steil the CEO of the German company TeamViewer a popular maker of remote support software Wolff also described how the troubled racing team is counting in part on TeamViewers tech to give it an edge in its bid to recapture its former glory. The two were speaking at the Web Summit conference in Lisbon and Wolff was cheered when he appeared before the crowd owing in no small part to Drive to Survive the Netflix series that has made him famous. He finds this amusing recounting to New Yorker writer Sam Knight how a young woman threw herself through the open window of his car to get her picture taken. Wolff immediately acknowledged the obvious as he settled in. We won the championship eight times in a row he said but that is the past. Mercedes he continued just got the physics wrong . . . and got the concept of the car not in the right place he said referring to the design of its floor which he has previously pointed to as the root of the teams lackluster year. Every few years the F1 teams  there are currently 10 altogether  are forced by the body overseeing Grand Prix racing to redesign their cars. Indeed its largely because it takes a long time to unwind things that are built into the car said Wolff that his team last year turned to TeamViewer a 17yearold publicly traded company whose software can remotely access and connect any computer tablet laptop mobile device or IoT endpoint like an industrial machine  or race car  to allow the remote control management and monitoring of these devices. Its a match made in heaven suggested Steil who said that TeamViewer is working closely with the MercedesAMG Petronas team to make it more efficient including running lab tests out of hours and supporting the trackside crew via remote engineers. We really try to go through a system like we have at Formula 1 like a team. We see the different parts and we see what can we do differently if we connect in real time in addition to what we do maybe on trackside and in the back office. Were really working through the different parts of the organization on testing obviously production maintenance wind tunnel all these kinds of applications where we try to see where can be better . . . Wolff chimed in separately to paint the bigger picture. We are racing 23 times around the world around the globe during the racing season and our core team is just 90 engineers with 2000 back at the factory including 1000 people focused on the chassis side and another 1000 focused on the engine. Operating in the field or we call it surgery in the field Wolff said is not always trivial because if you open up an engine or a complicated cooling system you want to have the resource from back at home and TeamViewer is the only technology that allows us today in having the guy back at home look through the same borescope into the cylinder head then help the mechanic on the field. As an added and not inconsequential benefit said both men the partnership cuts down on emissions because it means moving fewer people around at a time when Mercedes is focusing increasingly on sustainability. In fact Wolff said the team has cut its emissions by nearly 90 in recent years. It is our responsibility to show our global audience of billions of spectators that if we can do it everyone can do it he said. Certainly the appearance was a great moment for TeamViewer whose other clients range from telecommunications companies to the fastfood franchise Wendys. Surely for a company promising great efficiency to its customers theres nothing like having a revered Formula 1 team boss sing your praises. Of course what racing fans want to know is whether the tech will give Mercedes  which has yet to win a race in 2022  enough of an edge to overcome the teams archrivals Red Bull and Ferrari. While Wolff is looking to tomorrow as he said yesterday it could take a while even with the faster feedback loops that TeamViewers technology provides the team. As he recently told the outlet RacingNews365 Mercedes is still eight to 10 months behind Red Bull in terms of Formula 1 development after its frustrating 2022 season. There is definitely a challenge he added but we are playing the long game all of us. The intense rivalry between the two teams though perfect for television remains very real in the meantime. As The New Yorker piece observes of the 10 team principals in the sport only Wolff and Christian Horner who runs the Red Bull team have ever won a world championship and they appear to truly loathe one another. Earlier this year reports Knight Horner referred to Wolff who lives in Monaco as a tax exile who  he added disparagingly  runs his team remotely. Wolff in conversation with Knight said of Horner in turn Hes just so simple.

Formula 1 are alienating themselves from their fans (again), https://www.gpblog.com/en/news/154419/formula-1-are-alienating-themselves-from-their-fans-again.html, RevenueTo understand ticket prices it is necessary to understand how Formula 1 generates revenue. The organiser of a Grand Prix pays Liberty Media up to around 40 million to host a race. Knowing that many people want to attend a Grand Prix they think they can even make a profit. But if ticket prices stay like this or rise further we will get the days of Bernie back. This article was written by Ludo van Denderen and originally published on the Dutch edition of GPblogRead more Heineken title sponsor of Las Vegas Grand Prix in 2023, It was the time when Dutch driver Christijan Albers was racing in Formula 1 that my colleague asked the chief sports editor of the Algemeen Dagblad in the Netherlands Why dont we go to those Grands Prix Theres a Dutchman competing The chief barely looked up from behind his computer. Formula One No there is no interest in that. Were not doing it. Article continues under ad These days the newspaper travels all over the world to report on Max Verstappen. Preferably as many reports as possible are written because Algemeen Dagblad knows they are read en masse. As all over the world coverage of the premier motorsport class has increased in recent years. Even in the United States the country that never seemed to care about Formula 1. Quality Of course it is great to see how popular F1 is at the moment. To a large extent this is thanks to the efforts of Liberty Media. Since the US company took over the rights from Bernie Ecclestone there has been a quality drive especially online to engage new generations. Formula 1 is more than just a sport it is also a show and entertainment. Americans understand that like no other. Read more Cheaper F1 tickets to attract more fans Unfortunately Formula 1 and in their wake the organisers of Grands Prix are starting to strike out which  just when things are going so well  may lead to the alienation of fans. Not only is there hardly any country that does not require a special season ticket to watch the races the prices of Grand Prix entry tickets are also taking absurd forms. Revenue To understand ticket prices it is necessary to understand how Formula 1 generates revenue. The organiser of a Grand Prix pays Liberty Media up to around 40 million to host a race. With increasing demand from countries and cities to have a Grand Prix Libertys adage is If you dont want to pay that well go elsewhere. So organisers are pulling out the purse strings. Little choice. Article continues under ad Somewhere organisers have to recoup this money. With ticket sales in other words. Knowing that many people want to attend a Grand Prix they think they can even make a profit. The fans will pay anyway. Indeed they do. For a threeday ticket on a windy grandstand at the hardtoreach SpaFrancorchamps 500 to over 600 euros is easily paid. Or take Monza which has tripled prices over the past three years. The Italians come anyway. Absurd The absolute low point now is Las Vegas. Surely its insane that you have to pay 2000 to see Formula One cars go by for a few seconds a lap Think about it for a moment. 2000. That could be a months salary. If you want to go as a couple with two children 8000. And that doesnt include a hotel. Just four seats. Indeed up to this point fans lay down hundreds if not thousands of euros or dollars to attend a race. With rising inflation and more and more people in money worries the question is how long Formula 1 was once under Bernie the plaything of the elite. It was precisely that image that the sport was slowly losing. Formula 1 is now synonymous with a peoples party. For everyone. But if ticket prices stay like this or rise further we will get the days of Bernie back. Then Formula 1 will be back to what it once was for the happy few.

Wolff: Reputation damage from breaking F1 cost cap enough of a deterrent, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/wolff-reputation-damage-from-breaking-f1-cost-cap-enough-of-a-deterrent/10394949/, Red Bulls breach of the cost cap limit in 2021 triggered a major controversy within F1 recently with opinions divided in the paddock about how extreme the sanctions taken again it should be. And reflecting on his stance Wolff said the main thing that would turn teams off from risking even minor breaches was the bad publicity such a move brings. Beyond the sporting penalty and the financial penalty which obviously resonates in the real world out there there is a big reputational consequence said Wolff. Were getting kids that are being bullied in playgrounds that are employees children that is not right through fictitious allegations from other teams. It was a first strong governance strong policing independent assessment., Red Bulls breach of the cost cap limit in 2021 triggered a major controversy within F1 recently with opinions divided in the paddock about how extreme the sanctions taken again it should be. In the end the Milton Keynesbased outfit was handed a 7 million fine and had its aero development allowance cut back by 10 because it overspent by around 1.8 million last year. Wolff was quite calm about the penalty the FIA settled on admitting in Mexico that while Mercedes felt it was too little equally he accepted Red Bull probably felt it was too harsh. And reflecting on his stance Wolff said the main thing that would turn teams off from risking even minor breaches was the bad publicity such a move brings. Beyond the sporting penalty and the financial penalty which obviously resonates in the real world out there there is a big reputational consequence said Wolff. And that is why I believe no team is going to put a foot wrong over the line because you dont want to have your partners and your team dragged into this space. Were living in a transparent compliant world. Everything needs governance and the sport needs it. As a sport overall this is the real achievement of the whole process. Toto Wolff Team Principal and CEO Mercedes AMG Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images Red Bull has found itself on the receiving end of some extreme media criticisms in recent weeks and its team principal Christian Horner has not been happy about the strains the cost cap case has put on staff  especially when words like cheating have been bandied about. Weve been on trial because of public accusations since Singapore said Horner recently. The numbers have been put out in the media that are miles out of reality. And the damage that does to the brand to our partners to our drivers to our workforce in an age where mental health is prevalent were seeing significant issues within our workforce. Were getting kids that are being bullied in playgrounds that are employees children that is not right through fictitious allegations from other teams. You cannot go around just making that kind of allegation without any fact or substance. We absolutely are appalled at the behaviour of some of our competitors. Asked why Mercedes had been so calm about Red Bulls final penalty despite initial anger when it emerged the rule breach had taken place Wolff said Im beyond the point now that I want to comment on what is being said there. So for me the most important outcome of this whole process is there is a penalty whether its too small right or too big  difficult to judge. It was a first strong governance strong policing independent assessment. And then a fine. That wouldnt have been the case in the past I guess.

A champion in F2 and Formula E the Dutchman had been knocking on the door of F1 for several years  making an array of test outings  when he stormed to a points finish for Williams in place of the unwell Alex Albon at Monza a performance which helped him land a fulltime seat with AlphaTauri for next season.

McLaren star's new attitude towards his F1 dream, https://the-race.com/formula-1/mclaren-stars-new-attitude-towards-his-f1-dream/, In little more than a year Pato OWard went from Red Bull F1 junior programme reject  in ridiculous fashion  to IndyCar star and future F1 tester with McLaren. The fact hes being trusted with 10 million Ayrton Senna McLaren F1 cars reflects the regard he is held in at McLaren but his approach to driving that car perhaps reflects a new or modified attitude OWard has towards his chances of making it to F1. Asked by The Race about how hes balancing his IndyCar career with keeping his foot in the door with F1 OWard says Step by step I guess Yeah step by step. But its also very important to enjoy where youre at enjoy the moment enjoy the present and maximise it., In little more than a year Pato OWard went from Red Bull F1 junior programme reject  in ridiculous fashion  to IndyCar star and future F1 tester with McLaren. The fact hes being trusted with 10 million Ayrton Senna McLaren F1 cars reflects the regard he is held in at McLaren but his approach to driving that car perhaps reflects a new or modified attitude OWard has towards his chances of making it to F1. Why driving Sennas M c Laren left OWard feeling mad Read more When he won the Texas IndyCar race in 2021 as part of a bet with Zak Brown he would get to test McLaren machinery in Abu Dhabi at the end of the year. It completed a whirlwind turnaround in fortune for the driver who was promised so much in the past but dare he dream this time it would be a reality Complications around the end of last year and the beginning of this one surrounding OWards future contract put a damper on a test where he probably wasnt physically prepared enough for F1  see comments about his neck being destroyed  and hed probably admit now he allowed himself to get caught up in the narrative that an F1 future was possible before it was realistic. Asked by The Race about how hes balancing his IndyCar career with keeping his foot in the door with F1 OWard says Step by step I guess Yeah step by step. And its important not to get too ahead of yourself. And its hard not to  very hard not to. But its also very important to enjoy where youre at enjoy the moment enjoy the present and maximise it. And I feel like with doing so doors will open and things will align. If I keep doing my job properly and keep performing. OWards contract dispute with McLaren turned messy and clouded the first part of the year until things began to turn around in April and at the Long Beach race in IndyCar OWard used a hotel room discussion with his cousin to establish a new attitude which can be over simplified for explanation purposes as you can only focus on what you can control everything else is out of your hands and will fall into place. Targeting a proper offseason and spending time with his family is a top priority for OWard as he felt like the business of last years post IndyCar season activities left him jaded by the time the season came around in February alongside his contract dispute that dragged on. It just sucked  M c Laren contract sagas effect on OWard Read more With a new contract in May he found a new level and only reliability issues halted a title campaign that featured him qualifying in IndyCars Fast Six on every single road course this year. Sorting his contract focusing on things he could control and ensuring time for himself away from the track all helped construct this new mentality or at least approach. Now OWard faces the complication of 2021 IndyCar champion Alex Palou coming into the fold and testing at McLaren as the pair shared F1 tests in Barcelona and Austria last month with Palou taking the first FP1 opportunity and running less than three tenths off Lando Norris on comparable tyres at COTA. Palou wasnt allowed to shine in FP1  but he still impressed Read more But OWards revised attitude  plus what appears to be the inherent belief he can take on and beat Palou on a level playing field  means F1 opportunities are a bonus as opposed to a key part of his immediate goals. After Im done with the FP1 Ill be able to relate a little bit more what it feels like but Im just so grateful for the opportunity adds OWard. And I want to be a sponge just absorb everything that Im learning and continue to learn. And just keep improving  help the team and just never forget to enjoy it because thats the most important thing. Enjoying it is a phrase that can certainly be used to describe OWards opinion of driving the Senna McLaren MP45B at Laguna Seca last month. Even if that came with pressure  Brown made sure OWard knew the cars 10 million value just as he was getting in the car to take it for a spin  the enjoyment and carefree attitude OWard approached the historic test in is the perfect metaphor for the new mental space hes approaching his contemporary F1 opportunities with.
F1 finally ready to consider credible 11th-team entry, https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-news/95331/f1-11-team-stefano-domenicali/, Sam HallFriday 4 November 2022 1514  Updated 1518F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali has claimed the sport is finally ready to entertain credible proposals to increase the grid to 11 teams. The value of the 10 teams currently in F1 has risen steeply since Liberty Media acquired the championship ahead of the 2017 season. Despite appearing to warm to the idea of an 11th team Domenicali warned again that it cannot come at a price to existing teams. This is what is written in the Concorde Agreement but mainly the point is that does a new entry bring a better position for the F1 world championship This is really in terms of value from a financial point of view and in terms of value from a sporting point of view., Sam Hall Friday 4 November 2022 1514  Updated 1518 F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali has claimed the sport is finally ready to entertain credible proposals to increase the grid to 11 teams. The value of the 10 teams currently in F1 has risen steeply since Liberty Media acquired the championship ahead of the 2017 season. This value was protected in the latest Concorde Agreement by the addition of a 200million antidilution fee that would be split between the existing teams upon the arrival of a new entry. Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff has been vocal in his opposition to any new team unless it can benefit the entire paddock and although echoing these comments Domenicali has hinted at a change in the position now from F1. It is not a problem having one more team to have better racing therefore we will see and we will monitor the situation said Domenicali in an investors call following the release of Liberty Medias thirdquarter financial results. READ MORE...F1 enjoys another revenue bump as recovery continues If there would be a real credible new entry that wants to discuss with us we are ready to discuss but we are not in a rushed position today for that. Franchise dilution cannot be allowed Michael Andretti has been battling to position his successful outfit in the sport and recently told GPFans that F1 would be our life. Despite appearing to warm to the idea of an 11th team Domenicali warned again that it cannot come at a price to existing teams. With regard to the value or the process of the possibility of bringing a new F1 team into the championship of course there is the primary step that both us and the FIA have to be in agreement on that he added. And I think the first thing that we need to consider is will this eventual possibility bring extra value to the championship If so of course we are going to discuss it internally and we will see if there is any kind of real potential for a new entry that can give value to the championship. On top of this there is a value that has to be recognised to the teams that are already in the championship because of course they cannot allow any dilution of their partnership with the F1 championship. This is what is written in the Concorde Agreement but mainly the point is that does a new entry bring a better position for the F1 world championship This is really in terms of value from a financial point of view and in terms of value from a sporting point of view.
Formula 1 | F1 and the USA a very lucrative honeymoon - US Sports, https://lookcharms.com/formula-1-f1-and-the-usa-a-very-lucrative-honeymoon/, Last June we learned that the broadcaster of F1 in the USA ESPN was now going to pay 75 to 90 million dollars a year  that is 15 times more than before. This can be seen in particular in the new sponsorship deals signed  US firms partnering with F1 teams. In total the number of deals between F1 teams and US sponsors has jumped 66 since 2020 and 21.1 yearonyear. As for Red Bull its new title sponsor Oracle also comes to us from the USA. Notably also if F1 teams engage with American companies it is not only for the money offered but also for their nationality., As we know F1 is in full and strong growth in the USA  the stands were packed in Austin last month and no less than 3 Grands Prix will take place next year on American territory Miami Austin Las Vegas . The FOM benefits from this great exposure but of course the teams also. Last June we learned that the broadcaster of F1 in the USA ESPN was now going to pay 75 to 90 million dollars a year  that is 15 times more than before. This can be seen in particular in the new sponsorship deals signed  US firms partnering with F1 teams. In total the number of deals between F1 teams and US sponsors has jumped 66 since 2020 and 21.1 yearonyear. 161 deals currently exist between American companies and F1 just for the year 2022 alone testifying to the extent of the partnership between the two shores of the Atlantic. In 2021 there were 133 agreements and in 2020 97 only. The latest example comes from Haas which announced the addition of USbased MoneyGram as title sponsor. For two years the McLaren has also been loaded with new sponsors mostly Americans like CNN or Google. As for Red Bull its new title sponsor Oracle also comes to us from the USA. The amount would be colossal we are talking about 500 million dollars over three years i.e. more than 70 of the amount of capped budgets covered per year. Notably also if F1 teams engage with American companies it is not only for the money offered but also for their nationality. Another company showed great interest and we chose MoneyGram partly because the other company was not American thus recently declared Gnther Steiner on the choice of MoneyGram. Ferrari at the brand level also benefits income from sponsors has grown by 26 in one year. Finally lets not forget that Williams recently went under the American flag with Dorilton Capital and that another American team Andretti is currently pushing hard to join the sport.
F1 reports increase in quarterly revenue in COVID-19 recovery, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/f1-reports-increase-in-quarterly-revenue-as-covid-recovery-complete/10394982/, Overall F1 revenue rose from 668m in 2021 to 715m in 2022 for JulySeptember although operating income was only up from 80m to 82m thanks to increased costs. Primary F1 revenue increased in the third quarter with growth across media rights and sponsorship partially offset by a decline in race promotion revenue. Media rights increased due to growth in F1 TV subscription revenue and increased fees under new and renewed contractual agreements and sponsorship revenue increased due to the recognition of revenue from new sponsors. In addition other cost of F1 revenue grew due to higher commissions and partner servicing costs associated with the primary F1 revenue streams and higher Formula 2 and Formula 3 related costs. Selling general and administrative expense increased in the third quarter due to higher personnel and IT costs and increased legal and other advisory fees., However the change was not as dramatic as in previous quarters because income in the latter part of 2021 was not impacted as dramatically by the pandemic as last year race attendances began to return to normal levels and the lucrative Paddock Club got back up to speed. Overall F1 revenue rose from 668m in 2021 to 715m in 2022 for JulySeptember although operating income was only up from 80m to 82m thanks to increased costs. The 10 F1 teams shared payments of 370m up from 338m in 2021. The JulySeptember periods of 2021 and 2022 provide for a fairly accurate comparison as both featured seven races. Six events were the same across both seasons while the major difference was that the first year featured the more lucrative Russian GP whereas France fell into the same period in 2022. Because of that change race promotion income was actually slightly down but that was offset by increases in broadcast and sponsorship revenue. Explaining the figures F1 noted F1s results in 2022 are not being impacted by capacity limitations and throughout the first nine months of the 2022 season F1 has seen strong growth in attendance in the grandstands and the Paddock Club. Primary F1 revenue increased in the third quarter with growth across media rights and sponsorship partially offset by a decline in race promotion revenue. The F1 logo Photo by Drew Gibson  Motorsport Images Race promotion revenue decreased due to lower fees generated from the different mix of events held with one additional race held outside of Europe in the prior year period. Media rights increased due to growth in F1 TV subscription revenue and increased fees under new and renewed contractual agreements and sponsorship revenue increased due to the recognition of revenue from new sponsors. Other F1 revenue increased in the third quarter primarily due to higher hospitality revenue generated from the Paddock Club which operated at one additional race in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the prior year period and has seen record attendance yeartodate. Explaining the overall rise in costs relative to 2021 F1 said These costs increased in the third quarter driven by the costs of higher hospitality attendance in the Paddock Club and one additional Paddock Club event operated compared to the prior year period. In addition other cost of F1 revenue grew due to higher commissions and partner servicing costs associated with the primary F1 revenue streams and higher Formula 2 and Formula 3 related costs. Selling general and administrative expense increased in the third quarter due to higher personnel and IT costs and increased legal and other advisory fees.
Ricciardo insists new Hamilton contract wouldn’t affect his F1 future as he aims to ‘come back with a vengeance’ in 2024, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.ricciardo-insists-new-hamilton-contract-wouldnt-affect-his-f1-future-as-he.njoqmlge4S9irGhkIVrvS.html, Daniel Ricciardo has brushed off suggestions that a fresh deal for Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes could make returning to the F1 grid in 2024 more difficult as he prepares to embark on a year out of the sport.

Ricciardo will be replaced by fellow Australian Oscar Piastri at McLaren next season and with Haas holding the one remaining vacancy on the 2023 grid the 33yearold recently admitted that its almost certain he wont be competing. READ MORE I wish it was like this more often  Ricciardo delighted with P7 finish as he explains Tsunoda crash One role Ricciardo remains open to is that of a reserve driver before working his way back into a race seat for the 2024 campaign with his name recently being linked to Mercedes  who need to replace AlphaTauribound Nyck de Vries. However a promotion from reserve duties to a race seat at the Silver Arrows appears unlikely at least in the near future with George Russell tied down on a longterm deal and team mate Hamilton confirming over the Mexico City Grand Prix weekend that he intends to sign a new contract. Ricciardo is set for a season out of the sport after a challenging twoyear spell at McLaren As the wait goes on to discover where Ricciardo will end up he made clear that his future ambitions are not pinned on the decisions of other drivers while expressing hope that Hamilton will continue for many years to come. The truth is I want him to stay in the sport. Hes one of the greatest ever to do it and I think competing with him going wheel to wheel with him is fun its awesome.

Asked by Sky Sports F1 about the prospect of Ricciardo joining Mercedes in a reserve role Russell said Yeah I think thatd be interesting. I think wed like to see that. But its up to Daniel to see what he wants to do with his future. Ricciardo enjoyed plenty of ontrack battles with Hamilton during his time at Red Bull

Primary F1 revenue represents the majority of F1s revenue and is derived from i race promotion revenue ii media rights fees and iii sponsorship fees. There were seven races held in the third quarters of both 2022 and 2021. There are 22 events scheduled for the 2022 race calendar. Throughout 2021 and particularly in the first half of the season attendance at races was limited due to the pandemic. Restrictions on fan attendance reduced as 2021 progressed with all races in the second half of the year operating at either full capacity or with fewer restrictions. The Paddock Club resumed normal operations beginning with the Austrian Grand Prix on July 4 2021. F1s results in 2022 are not being impacted by capacity limitations and throughout the first nine months of the 2022 season F1 has seen strong growth in attendance in the grandstands and the Paddock Club. Primary F1 revenue increased in the third quarter with growth across media rights and sponsorship partially offset by a decline in race promotion revenue. Race promotion revenue decreased due to lower fees generated from the different mix of events held with one additional race held outside of Europe in the prior year period. Media rights increased due to growth in F1 TV subscription revenue and increased fees under new and renewed contractual agreements and sponsorship revenue increased due to the recognition of revenue from new sponsors. Other F1 revenue increased in the third quarter primarily due to higher hospitality revenue generated from the Paddock Club which operated at one additional race in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the prior year period and has seen record attendance yeartodate. Operating income was flat and adjusted OIBDA2 decreased in the third quarter. Cost of F1 revenue increased compared to the prior year due to the pro rata recognition of increased team payments. Other cost of F1 revenue is largely variable in nature and mostly relates to revenue opportunities. These costs increased in the third quarter driven by the costs of higher hospitality attendance in the Paddock Club and one additional Paddock Club event operated compared to the prior year period. In addition other cost of F1 revenue grew due to higher commissions and partner servicing costs associated with the Primary F1 revenue streams and higher Formula 2 and Formula 3 related costs. Selling general and administrative expense increased in the third quarter due to higher personnel and IT costs and increased legal and other advisory fees. The Liberty SiriusXM Group holds an approximate 1.8 intergroup interest 4.2 million notional shares in the Formula One Group as of October 31 2022. These shares are not included in the outstanding share count of Formula One Group in Liberty Medias most recent Form 10Q. Assuming the issuance of the shares underlying this intergroup interest the Formula One Group outstanding share count as of October 31 2022 would have been 238 million. The businesses and assets attributed to the Formula One Group consist of Liberty Medias subsidiary F1 its interest in Liberty Media Acquisition Corporation other minority investments and an intergroup interest in the Braves Group. BRAVES GROUP  The following table provides the financial results attributed to the Braves Group for the third quarter of 2022. In the third quarter approximately 5 million of corporate level selling general and administrative expense including stockbased compensation expense was allocated to the Braves Group. 3Q21 3Q22 amounts in millions Braves Group Revenue Corporate and other  234  252 Operating Income Corporate and other  30  8 Adjusted OIBDA Corporate and other  55  38 The following table provides the operating results of Braves Holdings LLC Braves. 3Q21 3Q22  Change amounts in millions Baseball revenue  222  238 7  Development revenue 12 14 17  Total revenue 234 252 8  Operating expenses excluding stockbased compensation included below Other operating expenses 153 184 20  Selling general and administrative expenses 23 27 17  Adjusted OIBDA  58  41 29  Impairment restructuring and acquisition costs net of recoveries  5 NM Stockbased compensation 2 2   Depreciation and Amortization 21 21   Operating income  35  13 63  Number of home games in period 34 38 Baseball revenue is derived from two primary sources i ballpark event revenue ticket sales concessions advertising sponsorships suites and premium seat fees and ii broadcasting revenue including national and local broadcast rights. Development revenue is derived from the Battery Atlanta mixeduse facilities and primarily includes rental income. There were 38 home games played in the third quarter of 2022 compared to 34 games played in the prior year period. A full 162 game schedule was played in 2022. Baseball revenue increased in the third quarter due to more home games played and increased ticket demand at regular season games as well as additional special events including concerts held at the ballpark compared to the period year period. Development revenue increased during the third quarter due to a reduction in deferred payment arrangements and increases in rental income from various new lease commencements. Operating income and adjusted OIBDA decreased in the third quarter. Increased operating costs due to higher player salaries higher levels of facility and game day expenses driven by more home games and higher attendance and increased expenses under MLBs revenue sharing plan more than offset revenue growth. Selling general and administrative expense increased primarily due to increased special event expenses marketing initiatives and personnel costs. The Formula One Group holds an approximate 11.1 intergroup interest 6.8 million notional shares and the Liberty SiriusXM Group holds an approximate 2.9 intergroup interest 1.8 million notional shares in the Braves Group as of October 31 2022. These shares are not included in the outstanding share count of the Braves Group in Liberty Medias most recent Form 10Q. Assuming the issuance of the shares underlying these intergroup interests the Braves Group outstanding share count as of October 31 2022 would have been 61 million. The businesses and assets attributed to the Braves Group consist primarily of Liberty Medias subsidiary the Braves which indirectly owns the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball Club and certain assets and liabilities associated with the Braves ballpark and mixeduse development project.

regarding our financial results this press release includes a presentation of Adjusted OIBDA which is a nonGAAP financial measure for the Liberty SiriusXM Group the Braves Group and the Formula One Group together with reconciliations to operating income as determined under GAAP. Liberty Media defines Adjusted OIBDA as operating income loss plus depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation separately reported litigation settlements restructuring acquisition and other related costs and impairment charges. Liberty Media believes Adjusted OIBDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition this measure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Because Adjusted OIBDA is used as a measure of operating performance Liberty Media views operating income as the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted OIBDA is not meant to replace or supersede operating income or any other GAAP measure but rather to supplement such GAAP measures in order to present investors with the same information that Liberty Medias management considers in assessing the results of operations and performance of its assets. The following table provides a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA for Liberty Media to operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP for the three months ended September 30 2021 and September 30 2022 respectively. QUARTERLY SUMMARY amounts in millions 3Q21 3Q22 Liberty SiriusXM Group Operating Income  604  434 Depreciation and amortization 152 157 Stock compensation expense 54 53 Impairment restructuring and acquisition costs net of recoveriesa 95  69 Adjusted OIBDA  715  713 Formula One Group Operating Income  68  64 Depreciation and amortization 100 89 Stock compensation expense 8 5 Adjusted OIBDA  176  158 Braves Group Operating Income  30  8 Depreciation and amortization 22 22 Stock compensation expense 3 3 Impairment restructuring and acquisition costs net of recoveriesa  5 Adjusted OIBDA  55  38 Liberty Media Corporation Consolidated Operating Income  702  506 Depreciation and amortization 274 268 Stock compensation expense 65 61 Impairment restructuring and acquisition costs net of recoveriesa 95  74 Adjusted OIBDA  946  909  a During the three months ended September 30 2021 SiriusXM recorded insurance recoveries related to the SXM7 satellite of 80 million as well as the reversal of a 17 million liability related to the Stitcher acquisition. During the three months ended September 30 2022 Sirius XM recorded impairment losses of 43 million related to the termination of certain software projects 20 million related to the impairment of vacated office spaces and 5 million related to personnel severance and Braves Holdings recorded 5 million of impairment losses as a result of hurricane damage at its spring training facility in Florida. These charges have been excluded from adjusted OIBDA. SCHEDULE 2 This press release also includes a presentation of adjusted EBITDA of SiriusXM which is a nonGAAP financial measure used by SiriusXM together with a reconciliation to SiriusXMs standalone net income as determined under GAAP. SiriusXM defines adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense income tax expense and depreciation and amortization. SiriusXM adjusts EBITDA to exclude the impact of other expense income as well as certain other charges discussed below. Adjusted EBITDA is a NonGAAP financial measure that excludes or adjusts for if applicable i loss on extinguishment of debt ii sharebased payment expense iii impairment restructuring and acquisition costs iv legal settlementsreserves and v other significant operating expense income that do not relate to the ongoing performance of SiriusXMs business. SiriusXM believes adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of the underlying trend of its operating performance which provides useful information about its business apart from the costs associated with its capital structure and purchase price accounting. SiriusXM believes investors find this NonGAAP financial measure useful when analyzing past operating performance with current performance and comparing SiriusXMs operating performance to the performance of other communications entertainment and media companies. SiriusXM believes investors use adjusted EBITDA to estimate current enterprise value and to make investment decisions. As a result of large capital investments in SiriusXMs satellite radio system its results of operations reflect significant charges for depreciation expense. SiriusXM believes the exclusion of sharebased payment expense is useful as it is not directly related to the operational conditions of its business. SiriusXM also believes the exclusion of the legal settlements and reserves impairment restructuring and acquisition related costs and loss on extinguishment of debt to the extent they occur during the period is useful as they are significant expenses not incurred as part of its normal operations for the period. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to SiriusXMs statements of comprehensive income of certain expenses including sharebased payment expense. SiriusXM endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the NonGAAP measure presented by also providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items including quantifying such items to derive the NonGAAP measure. Investors that wish to compare and evaluate operating results after giving effect for these costs should refer to net income as disclosed in SiriusXMs unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Since adjusted EBITDA is a NonGAAP financial performance measure SiriusXMs calculation of adjusted EBITDA may be susceptible to varying calculations may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered in isolation as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliation of net income to the adjusted EBITDA is calculated as follows Unaudited For the Three Months Ended September 30 2021 2022  in millions Net income  343  247 Add back items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA Impairment restructuring and acquisition costsa 95  69 Sharebased payment expense 51 50 Depreciation and amortization 135 134 Interest expense 111 107 Loss on extinguishment of debt 83  Other expense income 1 3 Income tax benefit expense 90 110 Adjusted EBITDA  719  720  a During the three months ended September 30 2021 SiriusXM recorded insurance recoveries related to the SXM7 satellite of 80 million as well as the reversal of a 17 million liability related to the Stitcher acquisition. During the three months ended September 30 2022 Sirius XM recorded impairment losses of 43 million related to the termination of certain software projects 20 million related to the impairment of vacated office spaces and 5 million related to personnel severance. These charges have been excluded from adjusted OIBDA. View source version on businesswire.com  Courtnee Chun 720 8755420 Source Liberty Media Corporation

Alpine: F1 2022 engine performance gain worth reliability risks, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/alpine-f1-2022-engine-performance-gain-worth-reliability-risks/10394839/, In Mexico Fernando Alonso lost seventh place in the closing laps after suffering a cylinder issue that obliged him to stop. Szafnauer insists that problems have largely resulted from a general push for performance with the power unit and that they can be resolved over the winter. So we made a conscious decision to push the performance envelope and fix reliability issues as we got to them because the FIA allows that. But if you have to err on that side you push the performance boundary because you cant add performance now until 2026 you can fix reliability issues. But the short term is reliability in the next few races finish strong and I think our performance will be there., Listen to this article The team has suffered more reliability problems than most rivals costing valuable ground in the battle with McLaren for fourth in the world championship. Alpine is currently in front by just seven points. In Mexico Fernando Alonso lost seventh place in the closing laps after suffering a cylinder issue that obliged him to stop. Szafnauer insists that problems have largely resulted from a general push for performance with the power unit and that they can be resolved over the winter. We mustnt forget that at the beginning of the year we set out  and this was before I was here but I think it was the right decision on the powertrain side  to err on the side of performance he said said. Because the powertrain was going to be frozen. So we made a conscious decision to push the performance envelope and fix reliability issues as we got to them because the FIA allows that. So that was a conscious and strategic decision. And now when we face them we can fix them. We didnt do it on purpose to not be reliable. But if you have to err on that side you push the performance boundary because you cant add performance now until 2026 you can fix reliability issues. And we can do it over the winter. So strategically I think it was the right thing to do. And we still have two races left to finish in fourth. I think we can do that. Asked by Motorsport.com if it was frustrating to lose valuable points in Mexico he said Ill tell you my frustration after Abu Dhabi For sure you want to score more points. Fernando Alonso Alpine F1 Team climbs out of his car after retiring from the race Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images Szafnauer acknowledged that it doesnt matter what margin Alpine beats McLaren by as long as the team can stay in front. No not at this point. And then over the winter well make even more reliability improvements. You cant improve the performance it is what it is. And well be better off. But weve got to remember this powertrain has to last until 2026. So for sure it was the right strategy. I think were on a good trajectory. And lets see what next year brings. But the short term is reliability in the next few races finish strong and I think our performance will be there. Szafnauer says that the Renault engine division in ViryChatillon knows what it has to do having fixed other issues earlier in the season. Yeah more than I do for example he said. So I was asking them about the Mexico cylinder failure. And then although I spent seven and a half years at Honda powertrains theyve got a much deeper understanding and theyll figure it out. But like I said strategically thats what we set out to do. Every time we have an issue we fix it. It doesnt come back. So this was a little bit different than what we had in Singapore.

'Magnussen could lose his seat instead' - Schumacher on Haas' driver line-up, https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1016267/1/magnussen-could-lose-his-seat-instead-schumacher-haas-driver-lineup, Haas have yet to decide who will complete their F1 driver lineup for next season. Magnussen has a multiyear deal with the team while the second seat is between Mick Schumacher and Nico Hulkenberg. Since the Austrian Grand Prix Schumacher has often been the quicker of the two Haas drivers particularly on a Sunday. Speaking to Sky Germany Ralf said that Magnussens seat should also be under threat for next season. In the last race Mexcio Mick was sometimes up to sixtenths faster than Magnussen  so lets wait and see for the next few races., Haas have yet to decide who will complete their F1 driver lineup for next season. Magnussen has a multiyear deal with the team while the second seat is between Mick Schumacher and Nico Hulkenberg. Despite impressing on his return at the seasonopening Bahrain Grand Prix Magnussens form has dipped in the second half of the season. Since the Austrian Grand Prix Schumacher has often been the quicker of the two Haas drivers particularly on a Sunday. Speaking to Sky Germany Ralf said that Magnussens seat should also be under threat for next season. Anything is possible of course especially if we look at the last few races he said. Who knows Magnussen may not be so firmly in the seat anymore. If we look at the races since Silverstone we have to conclude that Mick is the more stable and better of the two drivers  and who has also had some bad luck with wrong strategies. In the last race Mexcio Mick was sometimes up to sixtenths faster than Magnussen  so lets wait and see for the next few races. I hope Haas make a decision soon. Maybe next year we will have two Germans on the Formula 1 grid. Recently team boss Guenther Steiner explained that its still 5050 on who will drive for the team alongside Magnussen in 2023. Im honest Its still 5050 he explained. Nothing has been decided yet he said. We will logically not make a decision between Austin and Mexico simply because time is not there. The next time would be the week after Mexico because we dont have a race then and have more time to deal with it.

Red Bull finalises Mateschitz succession plan, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/red-bull-finalises-mateschitz-succession-plan/10394847/, Listen to this articleJust a fortnight after Mateschitz passed away Red Bull has settled on how the company will be controlled going forward. In a letter that Mateschitzs son Mark sent to Red Bull staff he explained that a solution proposed by my father and supported by our Thai partners would be put in place. Before joining Red Bull Mintzlaff was a longdistance runner. Speaking recently Horner said that Mateschitz had ensured that the longterm future of Red Bulls F1 operations was secure. And with in 2026 Red Bull becoming a power unit manufacturer that was the missing piece of our jigsaw and he had the vision to enable that to happen., Listen to this article Just a fortnight after Mateschitz passed away Red Bull has settled on how the company will be controlled going forward. It has been decided that strategicoperational responsibility at Red Bull will no longer be executed by a single CEO as it did under Mateschitz and will instead be divided among three people. In a letter that Mateschitzs son Mark sent to Red Bull staff he explained that a solution proposed by my father and supported by our Thai partners would be put in place. The latter comment is a reference to the Yoovidhya family of entrepreneurs. Red Bulls business will therefore be taken care of in the future by a socalled Board of Directors consisting of Franz Watzlawick CEO Beverage Business Alexander Kirchmayr CFO and Oliver Mintzlaff CEO Corporate Projects and Investments Mateschitz Jr. added Franz Alexander and Oliver were our dream team. I am very happy that they will be taking on this task. The division of responsibility means that F1 teams Red Bull and AlphaTauri will fall under the responsibility of Mintzlaff who counts sponsorship among his new tasks and Kirchmayr from now on. With Kirchmayr being the new CFO in the Group he will likely be the one who gives the thumbsup or thumbsdown on all budgets. A Red Bull statement read Following the passing of Dietrich Mateschitz we are pleased to learn of the appointment of Oliver Mintzlaff to CEO of Corporate Projects and investments. Although there wont be any changes in the daytoday with Oracle Red Bull Racing we look forward to working closely with someone likeminded who has such a strong pedigree in elite sports. Mintzlaff is no stranger to German sports fans. Most recently he was chairman of the board of the Bundesliga soccer club RB Leipzig e. V. and managing director of RB Leipzig GmbH. Prior to that he was in charge of coordinating all of Red Bulls global soccer commitments from 2014 until Leipzigs promotion to the Bundesliga in 2016. Before joining Red Bull Mintzlaff was a longdistance runner. In 1999 he finished fifth in the German halfmarathon championships and eighth in the 10kilometre distance in 2001. Sergio Perez Red Bull Racing RB18 Photo by Steven Tee  Motorsport Images From 2000 to 2008 he worked for the sporting goods manufacturer Puma and later as a player consultant and manager among other things. It is thought unlikely that Red Bulls F1 operations will change much as a result of the new senior management structure especially with F1 team boss Christian Horner having helped lead the squad back to its first championship double since 2013. Speaking recently Horner said that Mateschitz had ensured that the longterm future of Red Bulls F1 operations was secure. The future is set said Horner when asked if any changes would follow Mateschitzs death. Hes put in place a very strong foundation for the future. And with in 2026 Red Bull becoming a power unit manufacturer that was the missing piece of our jigsaw and he had the vision to enable that to happen. And just as weve done with the chassis we will take that same spirit his spirit into the future engine company.

Why Hamilton changed his mind about racing in F1 after 40, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/why-hamilton-changed-his-mind-about-racing-in-f1-after-40/10394765/, Why is a driver who is so determined to make an impact beyond what he does ontrack keen to keep on racing Hamilton admitted in Mexico last week that he wasnt sure what had changed his mind on wanting to keep racing after being 40. Thats been a really interesting process and Im grateful to be a part of it said Hamilton. I get asked every day to do so many different things and Im able to push back and say no. I think theres more stuff to achieve together.Lewis Hamilton Mercedes AMG 2nd position with his trophy Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images, Listen to this article Hamilton has often joked that he does not want to be the oldest driver on the grid embracing the continued contract extensions for Fernando Alonso who at 41 is preparing to keep on racing for at least a few more years. More seriously Hamilton has always vowed that he would not want to keep on racing until he is totally burnt out instead wishing to bow out when he is still fresh and has the energy to focus on other projects. Mission 44 his charity dedicated to improving representation in motorsport and Ignite a charity set up with Mercedes also intended to aid diversity are two such interests that will be the focus of his postracing life ensuring he has a legacy that goes beyond his ontrack achievements. But after Hamilton revealed in a group media interview including Motorsport.com in Austin last month that he plans to sign a new multiyear contract with Mercedes it led to a fresh look at where he currently stands in F1. His existing deal expires at the end of 2023 by when he will be 38. Even if he went on for only another two years that would take him close to his 41st birthday passing a milestone he once scoffed at. So whats changed for Hamilton Why is a driver who is so determined to make an impact beyond what he does ontrack keen to keep on racing Hamilton admitted in Mexico last week that he wasnt sure what had changed his mind on wanting to keep racing after being 40. He mentioned this narrative of winding down towards the end as being something he did not subscribe to and that even with his outside interests the support of Mercedes to pursue them could keep him energised ontrack. Im just in a happy place said Hamilton. Im a lot more grounded Ive got my home that I get to spend time in in the UK when I come to see the team for example my family come down. I have a lot better setup just all round. And I feel like I can take the team to more championships. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes AMG Photo by Steve Etherington  Motorsport Images Hamilton has always made clear that breaking the record for the most championships by winning an eighth title is not something that will define his future even given the circumstances of his defeat to Max Verstappen last year. He has often talked about the journey Mercedes now finds itself on trying to return to the top after being toppled amid its struggles with the new technical regulations for 2022. Walking away while the team is yet to return to the top of the mountain does not seem to be something on Hamiltons radar. Hamilton admitted it was difficult to say how much of an impact the struggles of this year had on his motivation to keep going. If wed had a year like last year and we were competing at the front all year who knows where I would be he pondered. But he spoke of the energy he took from seeing the team come together in 2022 noting the new level vulnerability he has seen in many of his colleagues through the current struggles. Thats been a really interesting process and Im grateful to be a part of it said Hamilton. I cant wait for the time that we get back to success that we finally get that win and we get that championship. Its going to make all these tough moments worthwhile. As Hamilton has gotten further into his 30s he has often spoken of his improved physical condition citing his switch to a plantbased diet in 2018 as being a life changer. When it comes to his training he has also learned to adjust his regimen as the years have gone on as it gets harder for all of us to stay in peak physical condition. So its about being more meticulous with your diet being more meticulous with your training said Hamilton. Like for example I did pilates with a good friend of mine the other day thats an Olympic athlete and it was so funny because it was something that wed never really done before. Id done pilates but just adding different things that you wouldnt normally do being more specific with your daily routine way more than when I was 22  I wasnt doing the things that Im doing today. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes AMG Photo by Steve Etherington  Motorsport Images Hamilton also noted the importance of looked after his mental wellbeing to find good balance within your life including setting boundaries to protect his energy and prevent himself getting overloaded. I never let that get to that point Hamilton explained. Its just about being balanced. I say no to so many things. I get asked every day to do so many different things and Im able to push back and say no. If I know thats going to affect my preparation getting in the way of my training or my time with my team or have any possible impact on my race weekend its a big no. Thats with friends thats with relationships. This is what Im focused on. It has all given Hamilton the kind of longevity that very few athletes will ever enjoy. Two tennis icons Serena Williams and Roger Federer hung up their rackets this year after playing into their early 40s. Tom Brady a friend of Hamiltons has managed to extend his career in the NFL well into his 40s despite the physical demands of the game. All of them act as inspiration to Hamilton. Toto Wolff Hamiltons team principal at Mercedes felt the Brady comparison was apt. For me the best athlete in the world Tom Brady hes on the field and being tackled and throwing the ball and hes 43 years old he said. So as long as you continue to look after yourself and develop your cognitive sensors I think Hamilton has many more years in him. Im pretty certain thats going to be the case here in the team. Wolff plans to sit down with Hamilton during a quiet time over the winter to discuss his next contract which is set to run to at least the end of the 2025 season. The way that Hamilton is talking there is no reason why it has to be his last F1 renewal  and why turning 40 could be long in the past by the time he finally calls it quits. Im not putting a limit on it to be honest Hamilton said when asked how much longer he planned to stay with Mercedes only confirming he was planning to do a multiyear deal with my team. I really really dont know what the next five years hold I think were still trying to work on that he added. Theres a lot of great things that are being put in place like Ive just launched a production company this week. But I feel great in mind and body. I think theres more stuff to achieve together.

McLaren not opposed to keeping Ricciardo as third F1 driver, https://www.motorsportweek.com/2022/11/04/mclaren-not-opposed-to-keeping-ricciardo-as-third-f1-driver/, McLaren is not against the idea of retaining Daniel Ricciardo for 2023 with the Australian continuing in a reserve driver role with the team. Ricciardo will depart his fulltime role with McLaren at the end of the current campaign bringing his original contract to a conclusion one season early. Ricciardo has struggled for performance at McLaren since joining it in 2021 and will be replaced by rookie Oscar Piastri next season following a contract dispute with Alpine.. How much Ricciardo would gain from his side taking on a third driver role with McLaren is a valuable question. The team will never accept him back as a fulltime driver as the 34yearold is hoping to return to a fulltime drive in 2024., McLaren is not against the idea of retaining Daniel Ricciardo for 2023 with the Australian continuing in a reserve driver role with the team. Ricciardo will depart his fulltime role with McLaren at the end of the current campaign bringing his original contract to a conclusion one season early. Ricciardo has struggled for performance at McLaren since joining it in 2021 and will be replaced by rookie Oscar Piastri next season following a contract dispute with Alpine.. Although his future plans are not yet known Ricciardo has confirmed that he wont be racing in F1 next year  however he wishes to remain part of the grid and assist a team. He has been linked to Mercedes and his former Red Bull squad but McLaren team boss Andreas Seidl admits that it is possible he could remain with the Wokingbased outfit in 2023. Thats a discussion we havent had yet Seidl said as quoted by the Spanish edition of Motorsport.com. Its a discussion we usually have in the winter as you know also we had an agreement with other teams to share referring to Piastri so theres absolutely no lets say bad feelings between Daniel and us so its possible. Is a fresh start the best option for Ricciardo How much Ricciardo would gain from his side taking on a third driver role with McLaren is a valuable question. The team will never accept him back as a fulltime driver as the 34yearold is hoping to return to a fulltime drive in 2024. While remaining part of the McLaren outfit would showcase his maturity to not be deterred from a difficult situation linking up with a fresh team perhaps Mercedes would leave him in a stronger position. Both Lewis Hamilton and George Russell have welcomed the chance to work with the eighttime grand prix winner. He would gain more knowledge through the backing of a new organisation and have more voices in his corner shouting his praise.

Mateschitz approved new Red Bull F1 windtunnel before death, https://the-race.com/formula-1/mateschitz-approved-new-red-bull-f1-windtunnel-before-death/, Red Bull is investing in a new windtunnel as one of the last commitments made by Dietrich Mateschitz to the Formula 1 operation. The windtunnel referred to recently as a relic of the Cold War by Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has limitations with temperature control because of the size and age of the building that houses it. It was one of the commitments that Dietrich made to the business to invest in a new tunnel he said in reference to Red Bull cofounder Mateschitz who died in October. The existing windtunnel came into the spotlight during the Mexican Grand Prix weekend in connection with Red Bulls penalty for breaking F1s budget cap in 2021. In recent years Red Bull and its technical chief Adrian Newey have been strong champions of F1 ditching windtunnels altogether and moving entirely to CFD development., Red Bull is investing in a new windtunnel as one of the last commitments made by Dietrich Mateschitz to the Formula 1 operation. Since Red Bull bought the Jaguar team in 2004 it has used the old Arrows windtunnel which was repurposed for F1 use having existed as an aircraft development facility since first operating as RAE Bedford in 1946. The windtunnel referred to recently as a relic of the Cold War by Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has limitations with temperature control because of the size and age of the building that houses it. It had been reported earlier this year that Red Bull was planning a new windtunnel that would take two years to build and be part of its technology campus in Milton Keynes bringing together all facets of the car and engine design and production in one location. Although it is unclear what stage the project is at Horner has told The Race it will happen. It was one of the commitments that Dietrich made to the business to invest in a new tunnel he said in reference to Red Bull cofounder Mateschitz who died in October. The existing windtunnel came into the spotlight during the Mexican Grand Prix weekend in connection with Red Bulls penalty for breaking F1s budget cap in 2021. It has been hit with a 10 reduction in the aerodynamic testing allowance it is permitted for the next 12 months and Horner said that punishment would be felt hard by Red Bull because of the windtunnels inefficiencies. Mateschitz wielded huge influence on F1 with such subtlety Read more In addition to properly regulating the temperature of the windtunnel Red Bulls takes time getting up to the maximum wind speed that makes for the most reliable measurements. Some of the time taken to reach this speed is also calculated within the testing limitations. The decision to build a new windtunnel was taken well before the budget cap saga even began let alone when the penalty emerged and will not be built until long after Red Bulls penalty has expired. It is an investment made because Red Bull feels its hand was forced by the gradual increase in restrictions on aerodynamic testing which has put an increasing emphasis on efficiency. While it would have preferred to avoid investing in a new tunnel it has effectively decided that in the current era of F1 its current facility is too outdated. Once the tunnel regulations were introduced then the efficiency of our tunnel just wasnt comparable with where the regulations are going said Horner. It forced our hand that we needed to make that big capital investment. Hed set the vision  Red Bulls F1 future without Mateschitz Read more So thats what weve chosen to do. The investment could have a limited value to Red Bull as like McLaren and Aston Martin it is building a new windtunnel at a time F1 has tentatively discussed a ban on windtunnels in 2030. This proposal had initial support from a majority of teams last year but without any real details when it was discussed this is not necessarily indicative of whether it will actually happen. Those who are opposed to the ban see the tunnels as major capital assets that would be a blow for teams to lose. In recent years Red Bull and its technical chief Adrian Newey have been strong champions of F1 ditching windtunnels altogether and moving entirely to CFD development. Horner said When you look at the way the worlds going simulation is playing a bigger and bigger role. We should have been brave enough to look at walking away from tunnels in the future. But unfortunately there was a fearbased culture rather than an embracing one.

More info Sebastian Vettel chose to snub childhood hero Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton when naming the greatest driver to grace Formula One. Vettel who will retire at the end of the season has always favoured Schumacher after growing a close relationship with his German compatriot. Seventime world champion Schumacher was a mentor for Vettel when he first made it onto the F1 grid and the Aston Martin driver has since assumed a similar role for his son Mick as the youngster aims to make his own strides in the sport. But while Vettel has always favoured Schumacher over Brit Hamilton also a seventime title winner he has opted for Juan Manuel Fangio when discussing the greatest ever. Vettel was interacting with a fan at the Mexican Grand Prix and when asked about fivetime champion Fangio the 35yearold gave an emphatic response. Im a fan of Michael Schumacher but Fangio is a little better the best the best the king Vettel said. Fangios motorsport legacy lives on after he dominated F1 in its fledgling years. JUST IN Mercedes explain Lewis Hamilton engine cuts at Mexican GP Vettel has named his F1 GOAT The late Argentine won all five of his titles in the first decade of F1 after its inception in 1950. And Fangio remains the oldest driver ever to win an F1 title after his triumph in 1957. In total the driver nicknamed El Maestro won 24 of the 52 races that he entered. After Vettels assertion one man who will be looking to enter the debate that also includes the great Ayrton Senna is Red Bulls Max Verstappen. The 25yearold is already a multiple world champion and is well on course to being considered in the conversation with such illustrious names at the end of his career. The Dutchman eclipsed Vettel and Schumachers joint record of 13 race wins in a season with a dominant 14th victory of the year in Mexico. Vettel opted for Fangio over Schumacher
David Coulthard joins Mika Hakkinen in making confident Mercedes F1 cost cap claim, https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/mercedes-cost-cap-coulthard-hakkinen-28405159, But Coulthard does not believe the Silver Arrows will be tempted to ignore the cost cap going forward. Lets say McLaren Ferrari and Mercedes all go over the cost cap next year because theyre willing to take a 10 per cent reduction said the Scot. His words echoed those of fellow former racer Mika Hakkinen who described Red Bulls punishment as significant in a blog post. Red Bulls penalty for the minor overspend is still significant. That final point about publicity is exactly what Mercedes chief Toto Wolff said himself when asked for his reaction to Red Bulls penalty in Mexico., Some have questioned whether the punishment received by Red Bull for their overspend during the 2021 season is enough of a deterrent for other teams in the future David Coulthard does not believe Mercedes will risk breaking cost cap rules next year in the wake of Red Bulls punishment for their 2021 overspend. Last month the FIA revealed Red Bull had exceeded the budget cap the previous season by around 1.8m which came down to 432k once a tax credit was applied. As punishment they were fined 6m and will have 10 of their wind tunnel time taken away from them over the next 12 months. Some rivals seemed underwhelmed by that punishment. Mercedes trackside engineering director Andrew Shovlin appeared to be one of them as he baulked at Christian Horners claim that his team gained no competitive advantage from the overspend stressing Money buys performance. But Coulthard does not believe the Silver Arrows will be tempted to ignore the cost cap going forward. Lets say McLaren Ferrari and Mercedes all go over the cost cap next year because theyre willing to take a 10 per cent reduction said the Scot. They wont do it because 10 is 10  nobody wants a 10 reduction. So of course theyre going to say that because the shoe is not on their foot. But as sure as they are in Formula 1 therell be something thats controversial about their team in the future. His words echoed those of fellow former racer Mika Hakkinen who described Red Bulls punishment as significant in a blog post. The FIA recognised that there could be various levels of overspend and reasons for doing so wrote the Finn. Red Bulls penalty for the minor overspend is still significant. Far more than the financial or aerodynamic penalty it has been an uncomfortable experience for the team. Image PA PA The good thing is that no team will want to risk repeating this next year so although it has been a very difficult and controversial moment for Red Bull I believe it will benefit F1 in the long term because every team boss will be determined not to have this kind of negative publicity in future. That final point about publicity is exactly what Mercedes chief Toto Wolff said himself when asked for his reaction to Red Bulls penalty in Mexico. Beyond the sporting penalty and fine there is also reputational damage the Austrian told Sky Sports. In a world of transparency and good governance its just not on any more. Whatever team you are youre responsible for representing a brand your employees and your partners and thats why for us it wouldnt be something they would do.
Ross Chastain gains attention worldwide with Martinsville move, https://nascar.nbcsports.com/2022/11/03/ross-chastain-gains-worldwide-attention-with-martinsville-move/, He did so at the Charlotte Roval and then at Martinsville to earn his spot at Phoenix. Aided a fourtire pit call by Stevens late in the race Bell charged to the win to move into the third round. Again a late fourtire pit call by Stevens helped Bell win to advance to Phoenix. That was the only thing he wanted to do a professional race car driver. So I finally got my little guy and hes wanting to get in a race car., AVONDALE Ariz.  A video game move sent Ross Chastain to the Cup championship race but it was a video game that helped start Christopher Bell on the path to Sundays title event at Phoenix Raceway. A 5yearold Bell was enamored with racing but after his parents bought a junior sprint car and collected sponsorship for it Bells first race almost didnt happen. When it was time to climb into the car for the first time he didnt want to do so. I remember just being super nervous about the situation and not wanting to drive Bell said. But his mother made a deal with him. Ill buy you a Nintendo game if you get in one time Kathy Bell said. Bell got into the car immediately. As soon as I got in I fell in love with it he said recalling the memory more clearly than what Nintendo game he got. After he completed his first practice run he exited the car and ran to his mom. Did you see me hit the wall Yeah. That was so cool Bell never again questioned getting into a car. When Bell climbed from his car after winning last weekend at Martinsville his first words were Mom and Dad we did it Theyll be here at Phoenix to see if their son can win the Cup championship in his first appearance in the title race 3 p.m. ET on NBC and Peacock. When Bell mentioned his parents after the Martinsville race it was as much for the counsel they had provided during the playoffs which have seen him twice fall so far back in the standings he had to win the final race of a round to stay alive. He did so at the Charlotte Roval and then at Martinsville to earn his spot at Phoenix. But the trials and tribulations of the playoffs wore on Bell. The biggest thing that hit me in that moment at Martinsville was they kept telling I was going to do it Bell said of his parents. Youre going to make Phoenix. Youre going to make the Final.  So when I won the race that was the only thing that I could think of my mom and dad were right and we did it we made the Final 4. Bell often keeps his emotions in check so such outbursts are rare but Martinsville was special. As they rode back home after the race last Sunday night Bells wife Morgan was jolted by a sudden exclamation from her husband. Hes in the backseat going through all of his text messages and going through this phone and out of nowhere he just screams at the top of his lungs Morgan told NBC Sports. Bell said it was just the adrenaline that elicited the reaction. It was a big moment winning at Martinsville and advancing where I am today is probably one of my biggest moments of my life Bell told NBC Sports. That just goes back the lowest of lows going into Martinsville and  getting right back to the top. But Bells performance in pressure situations is a trait of the 27yearold from Norman Oklahoma. He has always been very very good under extreme pressure Bells father David told NBC Sports. David Bell saw it when he coached his son in youth basketball and their team played in the finals. While the team lost Bells performance stood out his father recalls. It carried through Bells dirt racing experience. He won the Belleville Nationals midget race in 2013 and won the Chili Bowl Nationals in 2017 18 and 19. He also won the Camping World Truck Series title in 2017 and made the Xfinity Series championship race in 2018 and 19. He faced more pressure Friday at Phoenix when practice didnt go as well  he was 20th on the speed chart. It was as if the team had the rest of the field right where they wanted. Thats right crew chief Adam Stevens said with a smile. Were just setting the trap. Bell starts Sundays race 17th. With the way these playoffs have gone for him its not surprising he would face challenges in the finale. After a first round that saw him be the only playoff driver to score topfive finishes in each of those three races things have been much more difficult. He blew a tire on two different occasions at Texas the second such incident causing him to hit the wall. At Talladega he spun and was penalized for speeding on pit road putting him in a mustwin situation at the Charlotte Roval. Aided a fourtire pit call by Stevens late in the race Bell charged to the win to move into the third round. Bell called that the defining moment of his season to this point. I think that really says a lot about our team because it would have been very easy to give up going into the Roval which we knew was not going to be a great race for us Bell said noting the struggles of Toyotas on road courses this season. As it turned out it was not a great race. We were back half of the top 10 car. The yellow flag came out and we were able to perform how we needed to perform to win. Those good feelings didnt last. Problems returned the following week at Texas in the opening race of the Round of 8. When Bubba Wallace retaliated and wrecked Kyle Larson Bell was hit by Larsons car and was done for the race. A week later Bell finished 11th at Homestead. He entered Martinsville 33 points out of the final transfer spot. Again a late fourtire pit call by Stevens helped Bell win to advance to Phoenix. Im fully aware that I have the right guy on the pit box absolutely Bell said. This is just as Bell pictured when he was a child. He never wavered Kathy Bell said of her sons desire to race. That was the only thing he wanted to do a professional race car driver. His dad said You need a Plan B son but he never got a Plan B. Kathy admits she didnt want her son to race but that changed one day. I was just praying about him Kathy said. We had two older girls and I had wanted this little guy forever. So I finally got my little guy and hes wanting to get in a race car. I really didnt want him to do that. I was praying about it.  I heard clear as a bell this is my destiny for him. So I gave in and Dave said lets do it. So we let him start racing.

Nikita Mazepin has surprise new career after his F1 hopes went up in flames, https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/nikita-mazepin-career-now-dj-28404414, But Haas quickly made the decision to cut ties with both Mazepin and sponsor Uralkali the company owned by his oligarch father. Perhaps aware he will struggle to find another drive in motorsport it appears Mazepin has turned his attention to other ventures. After one of the photos was shared across social media some F1 fans couldnt resist poking fun at the Russian. Mazepin has previously suggested he could one day return to F1  but not with Haas after accusing team principal Guenther Steiner of lacking human qualities. I think one day I will be in F1 as a businessman but there is no hurry., Mazepin managed just one season in Formula 1 with Haas before he was unceremoniously sacked by the team in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February Nikita Mazepin has surprise new career after his F1 hopes went up in flames Nikita Mazepin looks to have embarked on a new career as an events planner after being axed from Formula 1. The Russian racer made his F1 debut with Haas but failed to score a single point during the 2021 season as the team fielded two entirely uncompetitive cars. He was set to be given a second crack alongside Mick Schumacher this year but things changed after Russia launched their invasion of Ukraine. The FIA made it clear drivers from Russia would still be allowed to compete provided they did not represent their country and did not voice any support of their countrys belligerence. But Haas quickly made the decision to cut ties with both Mazepin and sponsor Uralkali the company owned by his oligarch father. Perhaps aware he will struggle to find another drive in motorsport it appears Mazepin has turned his attention to other ventures. His latest seems to be an event planning firm called The Ninety Nine Events which threw a big Halloweenthemed bash this week. Photos published on his Instagram account show partygoers in fancy dress enjoying themselves in front of a large screen with Mazepins surname displayed in large letters. Another snap shows the former racer wearing headphones while operating DJ decks. This year I had to say goodbye to Formula 1 for a while he wrote in the caption. But in order to open up to something different it is important to come to terms with setbacks and trouble. If one path for selfexpression is closed then you need to look for another. For the first time I come before you in such a role. Its great that you can discover new frontiers and find opportunities for development in your own projects. After one of the photos was shared across social media some F1 fans couldnt resist poking fun at the Russian. Cant spin a car anymore so hes spinning tracks instead wrote one in reference to the Mazespin nickname he was given by some over his habit of losing control of his car during his one and only F1 season. He probably crashed the computer he was playing the music on joked another. Mazepin has previously suggested he could one day return to F1  but not with Haas after accusing team principal Guenther Steiner of lacking human qualities. He said When a team boss behaves like that then I think there are nine other teams with whom I can have a dialogue. I think one day I will be in F1 as a businessman but there is no hurry.

Ralf Schumacher suggests Haas could drop Magnussen for 2023, https://racingnews365.com/ralf-schumacher-suggests-haas-could-drop-magnussen-for-2023, However sixtime Grand Prix winner Ralf has suggested that Haas might be better advised to retain Schumacher and replace Magnussen with Hulkenberg. Ralf Schumacher has suggested that the Haas Formula 1 team could potentially drop Kevin Magnussen for the 2023 season. Schumacher on MagnussenWith Mick Schumacher is his second F1 season he has come in for criticism for a number of unforced errors with heavy shunts in Jeddah Monaco and Suzuka drawing a public rebuke from Steiner. Speaking to Sky Germany Ralf Schumacher points to this upturn in form as a case for retaining Mick Schumacher. As of the Mexican Grand Prix Magnussen has 24 points and is 13th in the Drivers Championship while Schumachers tally of 12 puts him 16th in the standings., However sixtime Grand Prix winner Ralf has suggested that Haas might be better advised to retain Schumacher and replace Magnussen with Hulkenberg. One of the final seats on the grid for next season is currently available at Haas with it expected to go to either incumbent Mick Schumacher  Ralfs nephew  or Nico Hulkenberg with Kevin Magnussen already on a multiyear deal with the team. Ralf Schumacher has suggested that the Haas Formula 1 team could potentially drop Kevin Magnussen for the 2023 season. Schumacher on Magnussen With Mick Schumacher is his second F1 season he has come in for criticism for a number of unforced errors with heavy shunts in Jeddah Monaco and Suzuka drawing a public rebuke from Steiner. However his form improved partway through the season with strong points finishes at the British and Austrian Grands Prix helping his case for staying in the sport. Speaking to Sky Germany Ralf Schumacher points to this upturn in form as a case for retaining Mick Schumacher. Anything is possible of course especially if we look at the last few races said Schumacher. Who knows Magnussen may not be so firmly in the seat anymore. If we look at the races since Silverstone we have to conclude that Mick is the more stable and better of the two drivers  and who has also had some bad luck with wrong strategies. In the last race Mexcio Mick was sometimes up to sixtenths faster than Magnussen  so lets wait and see for the next few races. I hope Haas make a decision soon. Maybe next year we will have two Germans on the Formula 1 grid. Since the British GP in July Schumacher has finished more races ahead of Magnussen than vice versa  five vs four when both cars finished  although the Dane has scored points more often. As of the Mexican Grand Prix Magnussen has 24 points and is 13th in the Drivers Championship while Schumachers tally of 12 puts him 16th in the standings.
Why Formula 1's overseer was right to penalise Red Bull, https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/11/03/why-formula-1s-overseer-was-right-to-penalise-red-bull, In 2021 the FIA introduced a cap on teams spending to try to increase competition on the grid. In that year the big prize the drivers championship was won in controversial circumstances by Max Verstappen while his team Red Bull came second in the constructors competition. Several weeks ago the FIA announced that Red Bull had breached the spending cap that season. Red Bull reacted furiously insisting it had complied with the rules. Zak Brown chief executive of McLaren accused Red Bull of cheating and demanded financial and sporting penalties., AS MANY PARENTS know to their cost empty threats are woefully ineffective. Once children twig that mum or dad is unwilling to follow through with the denial of pocket money or confinement to the house authority is lost. The lesson is a useful one for sporting authorities too. One that seems to have learned it is the Fdration Internationale de lAutomobile  FIA  the governing body of Formula 1 motor racing. And one that needs to is UEFA  which supposedly rules over European football. In 2021 the FIA introduced a cap on teams spending to try to increase competition on the grid. Constructors were limited to spending 145m on research and development and on building and testing cars. Other expenses such as drivers salaries and marketing were exempt. In that year the big prize the drivers championship was won in controversial circumstances by Max Verstappen while his team Red Bull came second in the constructors competition. Several weeks ago the FIA announced that Red Bull had breached the spending cap that season. The breachspending up to 5 above the capwas the second most serious of the four categories. The Aston Martin team was also found to be in breach but in a lesser procedural category. Red Bull reacted furiously insisting it had complied with the rules. Its rivals were furious too. Zak Brown chief executive of McLaren accused Red Bull of cheating and demanded financial and sporting penalties. When the FIA handed down Red Bulls punishment at the end of October it predictably satisfied no one. It fined the team 7m a good deal more than the sum by which it had overspent and cut the amount of time it will be allowed to spend on aerodynamic testing over the next 12 months by 10. Red Bulls boss Christian Horner called the penalties draconian and complained that the reduction in windtunnel time would hurt his teams competitiveness. Meanwhile his counterpart at Mercedes Toto Wolff said that the punishment was too little. Yet having tightened its rules the FIA acted in the only way that made senseeven if people on either side might grumble that it was too severe or too lenient. The weakness of its counterpart in European football provides a contrasting and cautionary tale. A decade ago with Europes big clubs spending ever more on players some of them recklessly UEFA drew up financial fair play  FFP  rules. It declared that teams annual expenditure on player transfers and wages should not exceed revenues from broadcasting ticket and commercial activities by more than 5m then 5.7m. Two of Europes most wellheeled clubs Paris St Germain and Manchester City which are both financed by petrodollars were soon investigated for suspected breaches. In both cases UEFA was concerned that the clubs outlays on players could not be justified by their income which appeared to have been inflated by sponsorship deals with companies linked to their Middle Eastern owners. Yet in 2018 UEFA concluded that PSGs deals just about complied with the rules. To reach this conclusion UEFA accepted valuations assessed by firms hired by the club rather than the much lower sums proposed by analysts commissioned by the governing body itself. UEFA did ban Manchester City from European competition for two years and fined the club 30mbut the next year the Court of Arbitration for Sport the highest legal body in sport overturned the ban and cut the fine to 10m not enough to buy a secondrate centrehalf. That wasnt because the CAS found that City had kept to the rules but because UEFA had taken too long to investigate. FFP became a laughing stock. It was quietly scrapped and in mid2022 was replaced with new regulations. By the middle of the decade clubs will have to limit spending on wages transfers and agents to 70 of revenue. This will mean big changes to the business models of many clubs. But the effectiveness of the regulations will depend entirely on UEFA s appetite for bringing transgressors to heel. UEFA may fear that if it tries to be harsh big clubs will set up their own competitions as they have previously threatened to do.

Step Aside Lewis Hamilton Formula 1 Has Entered the Max Verstappen Era, https://www.autoweek.com/racing/formula-1/a41854877/step-aside-lewis-hamilton-formula-1-has-entered-the-max-verstappen-era/, Haas F1 team principal Guenther Steiner says that F1 has turned the page on Lewis Hamilton and its now the Max Verstappen era. Modern Formula 1 has gone from the Michael Schumacher era to the Sebastian Vettel era to Lewis Hamilton era to a new era according to Haas F1 team principal Guenther Steiner. Steiner says welcome to the Max Verstappen era. In this era its just Max Steiner told the German broadcaster NTV. Formula has a new king of the mountain and its Max Verstappen., Haas F1 team principal Guenther Steiner says that F1 has turned the page on Lewis Hamilton and its now the Max Verstappen era. Verstappen follows the dynasties of Michael Schumacher seven championships Sebastian Vettel four championships and Hamilton seven championships. Red Bull consultant Dr. Helmut Marko says it might be to early to pencil in Verstappen for a long run of championships. Modern Formula 1 has gone from the Michael Schumacher era to the Sebastian Vettel era to Lewis Hamilton era to a new era according to Haas F1 team principal Guenther Steiner. Steiner says welcome to the Max Verstappen era. Although the 2021 season finale and this years budget cap scandal muddied Verstappens achievements Steiner says the Verstappen era is similar to the Hamilton Vettel and Schumacher eras that preceded it. Every era has its champion. In this era its just Max Steiner told the German broadcaster NTV. We are right in the middle of that era now. Hes got the talent the drive hes just a master at the moment. Formula has a new king of the mountain and its Max Verstappen. NurPhoto Getty Images As for who might challenge Verstappens superiority next year Steiner answered I think Charles Leclercs driving skills are very good at the moment. But sometimes he still makes mistakesa little too many mistakes. And Max just doesnt make them anywhere. Steiner also believes that seventime world champion Lewis Hamilton is still good. Max however is the man now. To be champion you need that little bit extra. A certain coolness a certain extra bit of luck too Steiner said. Max is just riding a wave at the moment and he doesnt want to get off it. Some however say Verstappens dominance is already boring. Take the cakewalk Verstappen had in Mexico where only two cars were within 49 seconds of him at the finish. When asked about that Red Bull consultant Dr. Helmut Marko told Osterreich Unfortunately we cant take that into account. For the rest Max delivers anything but boring races. In Austria for example his races are rewarded with top ratings. Marko though doesnt expect Verstappens current level of dominance to carry over into 2023. We approach the matter realistically said the 79yearold Austrian. It is indeed amazing how the season has turned out. You couldnt have predicted that Max would be in such form. Unfortunately its not enough for the 19 wins in one season Marko added referring to Mercedes win total as a team in 2016. When told that Red Bull could target that for 2023 Marko answered I hardly think its possible for everything to fit together like this for another season. However Max has not yet reached the end of his development. He is even more mature faster tirefriendly. Theres still incredible room for improvement.
Sainz praises Verstappen for ‘evolving in every single area’ en route to successive F1 world titles, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.sainz-praises-verstappen-for-evolving-in-every-single-area-en-route-to.56ZsXtiPQr8uRsNKgKkPej.html, Carlos Sainz has added to the words of praise sent in Max Verstappens direction after the Dutchman secured his second F1 title noting how much he believes his former team mate has improved over the years. Verstappen made his F1 debut alongside Sainz at Toro Rosso back in 2015 the two drivers spending just over a season together before the Dutchman secured promotion to the senior Red Bull team and embarked on a winning journey. Since then Verstappen has racked up 19 pole positions 34 victories and his aforementioned backtoback championships while Sainz has found a new home at Ferrari  leading to plenty more battles between the pair this time at the front of the F1 field.

Room for one more F1 race in the Americas says Mexican GP promoter, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/room-for-one-more-f1-race-in-the-americas-says-mexican-gp-promoter/10394392/, With grands prix also taking place in Canada and Brazil there will be six races in the Americas in 2023. So I think thats good for the region for the timezone that is very good. So with Canada three races in the United States Mexico and Brazil the question is if there room for another one Its a great show and a great window to present Mexico in a good fashion to the world. I would rather to have a race every other year than have no race at all., Listen to this article Last weekends race at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez in Mexico City attracted a sellout crowd of 397000 fans over three days once again making it one of the bestattended races of the season. The continued strong fan presence in Mexico comes amid F1s current boom in the neighbouring United States which will host three races next year in Miami Austin and Las Vegas. With grands prix also taking place in Canada and Brazil there will be six races in the Americas in 2023. But amid continued interest from countries in hosting a grand prix in the future Alejandro Soberon the chief executive of CIE that promotes the race in Mexico felt there would be scope to add another event in the Americas. We love competition its good because it keeps you in shape and alert said Soberon. Three races in the States before it was unthinkable. Today it even looks reasonable. I think Miami is going to be a very big success. You saw the attendance in Austin. Its much better than other years its a stronger race. And all the presales in Vegas are through the roof. So I think thats good for the region for the timezone that is very good. So with Canada three races in the United States Mexico and Brazil the question is if there room for another one My personal belief is there is room for another one. But it doesnt have to go against another race in the same timezone. It can go against another timezone. So whos going to be at risk how competitive is that offer Its going to be very interesting. Lance Stroll Aston Martin waves to the crowd on the drivers parade Photo by Sam Bloxham  Motorsport Images Mexico announced on Thursday that it had signed a new threeyear contract ensuring F1 will continue to visit the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez until at least 2025. But Soberon explained that come the next renewal there could be a new government and city mayor in place following the elections in 2024. Mexico initially returned to the calendar in 2015 with a deal that was funded by the federal government but a change in the government meant the Mexico City mayor and her administration took over securing the funding for the race for the existing deal and the renewal. Soberon felt confident the grand prix would continue to get national support regardless of the ruling bodies believing everyone in the country was very proud about the race. They love Checo Perez what hes achieving said Soberon. Its a great show and a great window to present Mexico in a good fashion to the world. Today there are more and more cities interested in getting a slot on the calendar. I think that basically means that everybody needs to move faster trying to make the alliance of interest to make it happen because I think Formula 1 is in a great position today. F1 will hold a recordbreaking 24race season in 2023 reaching the limit set out by the Concorde Agreement after adding a new event in Las Vegas as well as bringing China and Qatar back to the schedule. Series bosses are known to be exploring calendar rotation as a potential way to ensure more markets particularly those in Europe can hold events every other year. Asked about the possibility of Mexico rotating in the future if required Soberon said When you have every year sold out and every year you sell it faster than the year before its something as a promoter you dont want to consider. Why should I have every other year a race when I can have one every year Im very competitive I deliver good dollars to Formula 1 and its a great market the Mexican market has a lot to do with the success in the States. The Hispanic population is very fond of races there. But you know for some countries that cannot manage to have the right funding certainly its going to be an option to do. I would rather to have a race every other year than have no race at all.
Additional U.S. F1 races good for Mexican GP promoter believes, https://racer.com/2022/11/03/additional-u-s-f1-races-good-for-mexican-gp-promoter-believes/, The expansion of the Formula 1 calendar with three races in the United States has been a positive move for the Mexico City Grand Prix according to the races promoter Alejandro Soberon. Mexico City rejoined the F1 schedule in 2015 three years after Circuit of The Americas returned the sport to the USA after an absence of five years. So I think thats good for the region for the time zone its very good. And everybody knows its a good race its a great experience. Mexico City is a very interesting city to come and do more things than the race., The expansion of the Formula 1 calendar with three races in the United States has been a positive move for the Mexico City Grand Prix according to the races promoter Alejandro Soberon. Mexico City rejoined the F1 schedule in 2015 three years after Circuit of The Americas returned the sport to the USA after an absence of five years. Since then interest in the States has grown to the point where there will be three events in 2023 but Soberon  the CEO and president of race promoter Corporacion Interamericana de Entretenimiento CIE  says theres even space for another race in the region. Im not sure about Central America but three races in the States before it was a challenge now it even looks reasonable Soberon said. I think Miamis going to be a very big success you saw the attendance in Austin is much better than other years so its a stronger race in Austin and all the presales in Vegas are through the roof. So I think thats good for the region for the time zone its very good. Canada three races in the U.S. Mexico and Brazil. The question is is there room for another one My personal view is there is room for another one but it doesnt have to go against another race in the same time zone. It can go against another time zone. We have many clients of ours who went to Miami. They loved Miami and they loved the race in Miami but they came back and they secured their tickets in Mexico and said Being there was great probably I will go back but I love my race. Soberon says the higher ticket prices in America also help to make Mexico City a viable alternative option to U.S.based F1 fans. On the contrary that more American races hurt sales because when you compare the price and the packaging to come here were very competitive. And everybody knows its a good race its a great experience. Mexico City is a very interesting city to come and do more things than the race. Then maybe instead of taking three days you take a week and come and see the restaurants and the culture in the city and interesting places. So it becomes beyond a race  it goes deeper than that. A further race in the Americas has been mooted in Colombia after a visit to Barranquilla by F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali earlier this week although RACER understands that is one of just many meetings that the sport has lined up due to the level of interest in new host venues wanting to join the calendar.
Ricciardo has felt like "a passenger" at times amid McLaren F1 struggles, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/ricciardo-has-felt-like-a-passenger-at-times-amid-mclaren-f1-struggles/10394511/, Ricciardo admitted that it was the first time he had felt so comfortable with the 2022 car. Not to be negative I dont even want to look ahead I just want to take today for what it is. So just to have an attacking race and especially for me with this car to feel like I can attack a little bit more with it its just a nice feeling. So thats where its just I felt a little bit helpless at times. But Ill take today and enjoy it and Im happy weve got a week off so I can enjoy it for a week., Listen to this article The Australian put in his best performance of the year in Mexico City last weekend using a successful mediumsoft tyre strategy that gave him the pace with which to charge up to seventh place  while negating a 10second penalty for colliding with Yuki Tsunoda. The race came just a week after one of Ricciardos most disappointing outings of the season in Austin where he finished a lowly 16th 10 places behind teammate Lando Norris. Ricciardo admitted that it was the first time he had felt so comfortable with the 2022 car. I guess better late than never he said. Im going to take today for what it is Im going to enjoy it and appreciate that we did our pace and it was awesome and whatever. I hope it means that itll be like that the next two races. Not to be negative I dont even want to look ahead I just want to take today for what it is. And hopefully weve learned something from it. Even the points finishes even probably last year I feel we were normally defending rather than attacking. So just to have an attacking race and especially for me with this car to feel like I can attack a little bit more with it its just a nice feeling. He said that it was good to bounce back in style after feeling so frustrated after the US race. Of course its not typical in a place like Austin for me to feel like that he said after the flag in Mexico. Theres so much about that weekend that I love. So it has to be pretty bad for me to feel like that in a place like that. Its just theres been a lot of times where Ive felt a little bit like a passenger in a way I just feel like Ive worked with such little grip that no amount of talent is going to get the job done if you know what I mean. So thats where its just I felt a little bit helpless at times. So you feel like you cant show really anything that youve got because youre just not operating on the level of the others. So today to kind of be able to at least lean on it and push and have pace and be a guy thats setting quick times makes me happy. I wish it could have been like this more often. But Ill take today and enjoy it and Im happy weve got a week off so I can enjoy it for a week. Asked by Motorsport.com if he felt that hed proved a point Ricciardo said I still know I can get the job done its hard when you cant do it week in and week out. Its a bit like Sebastian Vettel those last few races he did phenomenal races and then people are questioning is it time to retire I think all of us can still do it on our day. Obviously its just the consistency for whatever reason. But I still love it. And I still want to get to the front.

TREMAYNE: Mercedes’ resurgence means we could be in for a thrilling end to 2022, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.tremayne-mercedes-resurgence-means-we-could-be-in-for-a-thrilling-end-to.32wqr9ZB34HSn5Qb8mWAvY.html, But perhaps its even more significant that the question in the aftermath was whether Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes should have won. Lewis Hamilton finished second at Mexico but should he have gone one better Both Mercedes started on the medium tyres while the Red Bulls were on the softs  did that call cost Hamilton victory Thats one of the delicious conundrums now that the championship titles have been settled in Max and Red Bulls favour. Hamilton believes the ability to hold on to Verstappen in the first stint was a clear sign of Mercedes progress, The very fact that wed all been discussing on Sunday morning whether Mercedes could win the Mexico City Grand Prix is a sign of just how much progress they have made in recent races. But perhaps its even more significant that the question in the aftermath was whether Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes should have won. One of the abiding questions which may be answered in the upcoming final races of the 2022 season in Brazil and Abu Dhabi is whether the upturn in performance was trackspecific. READ MORE We know where we need to improve says Hamilton after P2 in Mexico The previous week at the Circuit of The Americas where Lewis has always excelled and Mercedes final upgrade of the year seemed beneficial the Red Bull still simply had too much pace. This time however the peculiarities of the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez appeared to deal the Silver Arrows a very strong hand just like it used to do to Red Bull in their highrake preground effect days. In the runup team boss Toto Wolff said On paper Mexico looks good our draggy car should be effective in the thin air. I hope we can give them a run for their money. Lewis Hamilton finished second at Mexico but should he have gone one better The track the thirdshortest circuit on the 2022 F1 calendar is 7350ft above sea level. Thats the highest of any and that altitude and the low air density in Mexico City is less efficient at cooling hot things such as power units and brakes and if teams arent careful their maximised cooling arrangements can play havoc with the aerodynamics. The ambient pressure is easily the lowest of the season and this too has a significant impact on things such as a power units breathing and performance and also affects downforce. The paradox is that while teams run their highest levels  exactly what they would round the streets of Monaco or the Hungaroring where top speed matters much less than cornering force  the cars still top out at close to 225 mph down the Mexican tracks long front straight. DRIVER MARKET Hamilton targeting multiyear contract renewal with Mercedes So Mercedes were hopeful that their aerodynamically draggy W13 might have a performance advantage in these odd conditions and so it seemed. George Russell topped the third and final practice session on Saturday before Lewis set the fastest times in the first two segments of qualifying. In the third which decides the first five rows of the grid he had his first run time deleted for a track limits violation and thus had to be very slightly more circumspect on his second to make sure of setting a time. As Max Verstappen set yet another pole position for Red Bull George was second and Lewis third just fivethousandths of a second slower than his team mate after an engine glitch. Both Mercedes drivers believed they could have been on pole. The auguries for the race thus seemed positive. Russell and Hamilton finished behind Verstappen in qualifying but both felt they missed an opportunity at pole And while Lewis always says he isnt interested in records he is currently still the only world champion ever to have won a race in each of his years in F1 and in his heart he would like to maintain that one. But now that the US and Mexico lie behind us only two opportunities remain and both would appear in different ways to favour Red Bull and perhaps Ferrari who had an appalling time in Mexico. So what went wrong for the Silver Arrows Why did Lewis finish 15.186s adrift of Max further back than in America And George fourth albeit with fastest lap Lewis said he suggested starting on the soft Pirelli tyres in the race morning strategy meeting and that when the tyre warmers came off the cars on the grid and he saw that the Red Bulls were on that compound his heart sank. I thought shoot he said using one of his favourite expressions because he and George were on the medium tyres Mercedes boffins believing that they would last longer than the softs in the first stint. READ MORE Russell takes positives from Mercedes performance despite frustrating P4 finish at Mexico City GP That would give Mercedes cars track position when Max and Sergio Perez had to make earlier pit stops to change to mediums and that when they switched their own cars to the hardcompound rubber it would pay off in the run to the finish as Red Bulls mediums wore out sooner. It was a mistake because the performance of the mediums didnt drop off and Wolff readily admitted it afterwards. The softs did well early on and when Sergio was the first to stop having shadowed Lewis after the latter had battled past George in the third corner after the start and then himself jumped the younger Briton Mercedes were obliged to cover him by stopping Lewis sooner than they had intended. Both Mercedes started on the medium tyres while the Red Bulls were on the softs  did that call cost Hamilton victory George meanwhile ever prepared to speak out for what he wants and believes in didnt want to stop so soon but was only allowed to stay out another five laps. McLarens Daniel Ricciardo stayed out until Lap 45 on his medium then switched to softs for the final 26 laps and electrified his fading career with a very strong run to seventh indicating the strategy that might have been better for Mercedes. The Red Bulls especially Maxs performed perfectly to the end on their mediums whereas both Mercedes drivers understood within laps of taking them that the hards had been a big mistake. READ MORE Wolff satisfied with rigourous Cost Cap process as Shovlin calls Horners draconian penalty claim an exaggeration So thats the most likely reason why Mercedes didnt win when perhaps they might have been able to had they wrested track position away from Max early in the race by running the same softmedium tyre strategy. But there was also the sneaking feeling that Red Bull still had a slight performance edge. Some days you get it right some you dont. Thats racing and Mercs boffins believed they were taking a worthwhile gamble. Hindsight after all is 2020 vision. Daniel Ricciardo went long on the mediums before switching to the softs which is what George Russell had suggested As it was Mercedes thrashed the Ferraris which looked woeful as they had to turn their engines down all weekend to maintain sensible temperatures. But does this all mean that Mercedes will be in the fight with their two rivals in the final races Thats one of the delicious conundrums now that the championship titles have been settled in Max and Red Bulls favour. TECH TUESDAY Why Mercedes experimental front wing caused a stir in Texas Lewis was adamant that being able to keep up with Max in the first stint  despite their different tyre compounds  and to keep Sergio behind him throughout was a clear indication that they have made a significant performance jump. And from the way he and George spoke afterwards they both clearly expect it to be similarly beneficial in Brazil and Abu Dhabi. Just how beneficial remains to be seen however. So many positives to take from this weekend Lewis said. And this is definitely the most competitive and the best the car has felt all year  and that is truly down to the amazing work from all the women and men back at the factory who have just been doing such an amazing job. And not giving up. Hamilton believes the ability to hold on to Verstappen in the first stint was a clear sign of Mercedes progress

Mercedes would prefer F1 race win over second in constructors' standings, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/mercedes-would-prefer-f1-race-win-over-second-in-constructors-standings/10394378/, But its consistency allied to recent improvements has left it in contention to overhaul Ferrari for second place in the teams battle behind Red Bull. Mercedes is currently lying in third place in the overall standings 40 points behind its Maranello rival. The win would be proof that our car is back to fight for wins he said when asked why he felt that way. P2 could also be because the others dropped the ball and youre just scoring more points.Lewis Hamilton took another second place behind Max Verstappen as Red Bull scored a ninth consecutive victory in Mexico. We are racing for a win racing for both cars on the podium the Ferraris are behind us., The German manufacturer has endured a challenging 2022 campaign and despite having got one pole position this year is at risk of not winning a race for the first time since 2011. But its consistency allied to recent improvements has left it in contention to overhaul Ferrari for second place in the teams battle behind Red Bull. Mercedes is currently lying in third place in the overall standings 40 points behind its Maranello rival. While the runnerup slot would be a good end result to a year that started with such difficulties Wolff says that he would actually prefer it to round off the season with a victory rather than stepping up a world constructors championship position. The win would be proof that our car is back to fight for wins he said when asked why he felt that way. P2 could also be because the others dropped the ball and youre just scoring more points. Lewis Hamilton took another second place behind Max Verstappen as Red Bull scored a ninth consecutive victory in Mexico. Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images While Wolff would not be against overtaking Ferrari in the points table he says that the better judge of the teams progress is how its car is performing on track. It would definitely be some consolation because Ferrari had the quickest car at the beginning of the season he said about the runnerup spot. Finishing ahead of them would be great but again its not our main priority. The main priority is to understand the car and have a quick automobile on the track. Mercedes had two of its best chances of the year to grab that win in the recent United States and Mexican Grands Prix but tyre strategy choices compromised its chances on both occasions. However considering the scale of the problems that the team faced at the beginning of the season Wolff is happy about the level of progress made  even though there are tinges of disappointment about the Austin and Mexico chances that got away. The thing is we are racers and the moment we can kind of see it in front of us we just want to grab it he said. Therefore there is always a sense of frustration. But we have come from such a long way and here we are. We are racing for a win racing for both cars on the podium the Ferraris are behind us. So you need to stay humble and of what we achieved while still reaching for the stars. Photo by Steve Etherington  Motorsport Images Mercedes feels it has a good understanding of what went wrong with its W13 this year and what needs addressing for 2023 as it looks poised to switch concept. However Wolff says there can be no complacency that the changes that are planned will guarantee it being back at the front of the field. Im never confident he said. I always see the glass half empty. So there is nothing to really see it positive. Ive just heard nine wins in a row for Red Bull so there is no reason to be overwhelmed with finishing second and fourth. We have a long way to catch up. We have the winter. I think were doing some good development on the car. Some of the things we are finding might be bigger steps than just adding a few steps of downforce. But were giving it whatever we have and more in order to bring us back into the position to fight for a championship.
Bottas to make Race of Champions debut alongside Hakkinen in 2023, https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1016187/1/bottas-make-race-champions-debut-alongside-hakkinen-2023, The 10time grand prix winner will participate in the 2023 iteration driving for Team Finland in the ROC Nations Cup January 28 alongside twotime F1 champion and fellow Finn Mika Hakkinen. Bottas will also drive in the individual Race of Champions on January 29. Im also thrilled to be able to partner Mika Hakkinen for Team Finland in the ROC Nations Cup. Then well have to put our friendship aside again and try to beat each other in the individual Race Of Champions. I might tell Valtteri before the ROC Nations Cup but only if he promises to have forgotten it by the individual race the next day, Bottas was set to make his debut at the 2022 event but was forced to withdraw days before it started. The 10time grand prix winner will participate in the 2023 iteration driving for Team Finland in the ROC Nations Cup January 28 alongside twotime F1 champion and fellow Finn Mika Hakkinen. Bottas will also drive in the individual Race of Champions on January 29. F1 retiree Sebastian Vettel and threetime W Series champion Jamie Chadwick are also confirmed for the event. Speaking of the news Bottas said Im really looking forward to being able to make my Race Of Champions debut at last. Ive watched the event on TV for many years and I came so close to competing last year until I had to pull out at the last minute. It was tough watching everyone having so much fun throwing their cars around on the snow and ice in Sweden so Im glad I will now be joining them at Pite Havsbad in January. Im also thrilled to be able to partner Mika Hakkinen for Team Finland in the ROC Nations Cup. I have become good friends with Mika over the years but it will be a special treat to be able to race alongside him. Weve both taken part in the Arctic Rally a few times so hopefully that can help us beat our Nordic neighbours  and everyone else. Then well have to put our friendship aside again and try to beat each other in the individual Race Of Champions. Whatever happens Im sure we will put on a great show for all the fans watching at the track and around the world. Hakkinen added Its great that Valtteri will be joining us at the Race Of Champions in January. I was expecting to pair up with him for Team Finland last year so all I can say is better late than never I can assure him the Race Of Champions really is as fun as it looks and to race on the snow and ice is brilliant. As we both grew up in about the only country thats even colder than Pite Havsbad we should have a chance. As for the secret to success I might tell Valtteri before the ROC Nations Cup but only if he promises to have forgotten it by the individual race the next day
What's going on with Piastri's Alpine F1 exit?, https://the-race.com/formula-1/whats-going-on-with-piastris-alpine-f1-exit/, It is believed that having initially continued to conduct simulator work and race weekend support for Alpine at Enstone after the summer break Piastri has been stood down from those duties. However he has not been formally released from the team as this would allow him to join up with McLaren early and potentially even run in the postseason Abu Dhabi test. Alpine was not thought to be keen to facilitate that so instead Piastri has effectively been parked. In Mexico last weekend Alpine team boss Otmar Szafnauer answered carefully when asked by The Race about Piastris status but said I think our legal teams are discussing that now. Its a discussion between Oscar his team and Alpine., Oscar Piastri has been conspicuous in his absence from the public eye in Formula 1 since his rejection of Alpine in favour of a McLaren move was ratified by Formula 1s Contract Recognition Board. Piastri has been Alpines reserve driver this year as part of a programme that the Renault works team envisaged would eventually lead him to take a race seat in the future. However as Piastri and his camp did not want to go along with Alpines plan to loan him out to Williams for 2023 and 2024 a deal with McLaren was done in secret early in the summer. Alpine tried to block that move by arguing it had a valid contract with Piastri but the CRB ruled otherwise leading McLaren to formally announce Piastri as a race driver in place of Daniel Ricciardo in 2023. That came on the Dutch Grand Prix weekend in early September but Piastri has not been in the F1 paddock since he publicly rejected Alpines claim he would drive for the team in 2023 in early August. It is believed that having initially continued to conduct simulator work and race weekend support for Alpine at Enstone after the summer break Piastri has been stood down from those duties. However he has not been formally released from the team as this would allow him to join up with McLaren early and potentially even run in the postseason Abu Dhabi test. Alpine was not thought to be keen to facilitate that so instead Piastri has effectively been parked. An update on his future could come soon though. In Mexico last weekend Alpine team boss Otmar Szafnauer answered carefully when asked by The Race about Piastris status but said I think our legal teams are discussing that now. Therell be more next week. So ask me in Brazil. Doohan had more nerves chasing Alpine seat than FP1 debut Read more Jack Doohan is a logical alternative to Piastri to become Alpines reserve driver fulltime in 2023. Doohan is set to be racing in F2 again but has completed 2021 F1 car testing in private this year made his FP1 debut in Mexico and will drive again on the Friday in Abu Dhabi. Szafnauer confirmed Doohan is also among the options for a reserve role but said we havent made that decision yet. Though there is no official news yet Doohan is likely to take part in the postseason Abu Dhabi test alongside incoming Alpine driver Pierre Gasly who has been signed to take the vacant Fernando Alonso seat that the team initially wanted Piastri to fill. Reports in Spanish media have also suggested Alonso is free to drive for his new team Aston Martin in the postseason test while Gaslys AlphaTauri replacement Nyck de Vries could drive there too. The only 2023 signing not currently expected to drive for their new team in the test is Piastri although McLaren team principal Andreas Seidl would not confirm that either way in Mexico. Theres not really an update from our side he said. Its a discussion between Oscar his team and Alpine. And no updates for the moment.

Lewis Hamilton and George Russell managed to split the Red Bull cars during qualifying at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez raising hopes that they could push polesitter Max Verstappen for victory.

Lewis Hamilton and George Russell managed to split the Red Bull cars during qualifying at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez raising hopes that they could push polesitter Max Verstappen for victory. However alternate tyre strategies between the two teams played out in Red Bulls favour with Verstappen executing his race on a more aggressive softmedium approach while the Mercedes pair used mediums and hards.

Asked if Mercedes should have been braver with their strategy on race day in Mexico Wolff pushed back saying No. In hindsight its always easier to judge but I think the onestop medium to hard looked like the right strategy. The car has really taken a step forward  Hamilton pleased with P2 in Mexico as Mercedes close in on Red Bull That the medium at the end held on for so long came as a surprise but hindsight is a thing. If we were to restart the race maybe we would choose a different tyre. It could have been an option to just lose more time on the medium and hang it out there for another five six laps and try to do 30 laps on the soft. But also that was not a given  with Daniel Ricciardos charge you could see that it was possible. Given that Hamilton has finished second to Verstappen in the last two races Wolff discussed the progress Mercedes have made over the course of the season and the impact of their latest car upgrades.

Horner: "Hugely worrying" that news of Red Bull's F1 budget cap breach leaked, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/horner-hugely-worrying-that-news-of-red-bulls-f1-budget-cap-breach-leaked/10394371/, It brought an end to the cost cap saga that first emerged over the Singapore Grand Prix weekend in late September when the first whispers emerged that Red Bull had breached the budget cap. Red Bull was only officially informed that it had breached the cost cap on the Sunday of the Japanese Grand Prix 90 minutes after Max Verstappen clinched his second world title. Reflecting on the case in Mexico following the FIAs ruling Horner said he expected followup action to investigate why news of Red Bulls breach had leaked out. The accusations made in Singapore were extremely upsetting for every single member of staff all our partners everyone involved within Red Bull said Horner. Christian Horner Team Principal Red Bull Racing in a press conference regarding the recent findings of the cost cap breach., Listen to this article Red Bull reached a settlement with the FIA over its 1.8 million breach of last years budget cap ahead of the Mexican Grand Prix arguing that it misinterpreted some of the permitted exclusions. The team was hit with a 7m fine and a 10 reduction in its permitted aerodynamic development for the next 12 months a sanction Horner called enormous and draconian. It brought an end to the cost cap saga that first emerged over the Singapore Grand Prix weekend in late September when the first whispers emerged that Red Bull had breached the budget cap. Horner hit back emphatically against the accusations when they were first made as well as calling out rivals for making defamatory claims without any official information from the FIA. Red Bull was only officially informed that it had breached the cost cap on the Sunday of the Japanese Grand Prix 90 minutes after Max Verstappen clinched his second world title. A public notice was then issued one day later. Reflecting on the case in Mexico following the FIAs ruling Horner said he expected followup action to investigate why news of Red Bulls breach had leaked out. The accusations made in Singapore were extremely upsetting for every single member of staff all our partners everyone involved within Red Bull said Horner. Obviously any form of leakage is hugely worrying. Its something that we expect to be followed up. Prior to the Accepted Breach Agreement being struck between Red Bull and the FIA a number of the teams rivals had been clear in the calls for strong action.

The FIA have handed Red Bull a 7m fine and an aero testing reduction Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images McLaren boss Zak Brown wrote to FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem and F1 president Stefano Domenicali to say that any possible breach of the cost cap constitutes cheating something Horner fiercely hit back against in Austin. Horner said after the FIAs ruling that he felt Red Bull was probably due an apology from some of our rivals for some of the claims that theyve made and that the team would make no apology for the way that weve performed the way that weve acted. Horner added We do take on the chin that there are lessons to be made. Potentially mistakes have been made in our submission which with the benefit of hindsight and 2020 vision everybody can be a specialist. But there was no intent there was nothing dishonest and there was certainly no cheating involved which has been alleged in certain quarters. So I dont feel that we need to apologise. I think there are lessons that have been learned. Everybody can learn from this. Weve taken our pounding in public weve taken a very public pounding through the accusations that have been made by other teams. Our drivers have been booed at circuits. And the reputational damage that has been made by allegations has been significant. The time has come for that to stop.

The shutdown is now a core part of F1 and has become more important as the schedule has grown. In 2013 19 races were held but the 2023 F1 calendar features a recordbreaking 24 rounds. This year marks the first time since 2018 that the season has finished before December but racing will start almost two weeks earlier than usual in 2023 as the world championship begins on March 5th. The last time F1 began that early was in 2002 and only starting before March 5th twice in the 19 years before that. I think its great that the season finishes this couple of weeks earlier than in the past because everyone is really on the limiter and I think we plan to introduce a shutdown in the coming year Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff said on Saturday at last weekends Mexican Grand Prix. Advert  Become a RaceFans supporter and go adfree Not everyone is in agreement but I would very much hope that we can do that for our staff. Having this week couple of weeks more is definitely a nice welcome. But on the other side theres many people in the factory who are going to work flatout all through the Christmas and New Year. But for the race team thats clocking many air miles thats positive. Theres many of us team principals that would like to replicate what we have in the summer. At least starting at Christmas and then going into the new year for two weeks. But obviously thats still being up for discussion but there was a positive indication. For the wellbeing of the team. His counterpart at Alpine Otmar Szafnauer expects the plan will go ahead in 2023. This year it isnt happening so itll be next year he said. Christmas its one of those things that always happens on the same day every year. Its not like Thanksgiving. So I think its from the 23rd of December. So I think everyone gets Christmas Eve and Christmas day off. But that week through to the start of the year. Szafnauer also believes the change will be positive for the sport. The way I look at it is were doing more and more races. And if you dont force shutdowns people work through because its a strategic advantage. So if you remove that advantage meaning everyones got to take it off I think its good for all of us. As there is no winter shutdown at present restricting work Szafnauer says Alpines wind tunnel usually only shuts down two days for Christmas and New Years Day. We used to shut it down two days thats it. So if you dont force that shutdown you dont get any time off. Advert  Become a RaceFans supporter and go adfree 2022 F1 season
Gasly's near-ban shows absurdity of F1 penalty points system, https://the-race.com/formula-1/gaslys-near-ban-shows-absurdity-of-f1-penalty-points-system/, The everpresent desire for consistency means that theres a set tariff of penalty points for certain offences. He tipped Vettel into a spin earning a fivesecond penalty as well as two penalty points. This earned him a fivesecond penalty and two penalty points although Gasly questioned why he had been singled out for it. That could potentially create a troubling situation whereby the stewards are reluctant to issue penalty points. But his situation highlights that while the superlience penalty points system needs to exist its current form is flawed and needs reform., Formula 1s superlicence penalty points system is a good idea but poorlyimplemented as the absurd situation Pierre Gasly finds himself in  of being potentially one incident away from an automatic race ban  proves. Gasly has accrued 10 superlicence penalty points just two away from the 12point tally that automatically triggers a race ban. This will be hanging over him for the next nine races given the first of them wont be wiped until after next Mays Emilia Romagna Grand Prix. Whats more he only just evaded a ban for the upcoming Brazilian Grand Prix given the oneyear lifespan for penalty points meant he lost two earned for contact with Fernando Alonso at the first corner of last seasons Turkish Grand Prix shortly before his latest runin with the stewards. The AlphaTauri driver has committed six offences in 15 race weekends stretching back to Mays Spanish Grand Prix so you can argue he only has himself to blame. But while Gasly is overaggressive at times particularly when things arent going well and would be wellserved to rein it in at times hes hardly a danger on track. Adopted in 2014 the superlicence penalty points system was conceived to keep track of repeat offenders and create a mechanism whereby a race ban could be imposed on drivers who showed a troubling pattern of ontrack behaviour. This was a direct consequence of the crash at the start of the 2012 Belgian Grand Prix triggered by Romain Grosjean that took out among others Alonso. It was a logical move given it was felt that the number of incidents Grosjean had been involved with previously contributed to the decision to ban him for the Italian Grand Prix. There was a need for a formalised system that could set the bar for when to ban consistent troublemakers even if they didnt cause as significant an incident as the one Grosjean triggered. The stewards described the Spa crash as an extremely serious breach of the regulations which had the potential to cause injury to others and highlighted that it eliminated leading championship contenders from the race. Setting aside the troubling assertion that whether a driver you eliminate is a title contender or not is a factor in setting punishments something that thankfully has not been cited since in a stewards decision this highlighted the fact that generally a driver would only be banned for a single major incident rather than an accumulation. And that such an accumulation wasnt formally tallied up. There have been cases of bans in the past for such conduct. Famously Mika Hakkinen was banned from the 1994 Hungarian Grand Prix for causing a crash at the start of the preceding race in Germany. Eddie Irvine was given a onerace ban increased to three on appeal for the accident he triggered at Interlagos in 1994 that launched debutant Jos Verstappens Benetton into the air. In both cases there was a feeling that the drivers in question were at times too aggressive and that this contributed to the ban. Gasly driving in reckless manner exposed key F1 blindspot Read more A formalised penalty points system with 12 the threshold for an automatic ban is therefore an effective way to plot the conduct of drivers. Where F1 hasnt got it right is the way that this is implemented. The everpresent desire for consistency means that theres a set tariff of penalty points for certain offences. If you gain an advantage by exceeding track limits or are out of position at the start of the race its one point. For causing a collision or overtaking under the safety car its two points. But theres little or no wriggle room to revise the number of points upwards or downwards to better reflect the offence. Looking at Gaslys rap sheet its clear that while he is a repeat offender the idea that he could be banned for one more mishap in the next races seems ridiculous. Gaslys penalty points Spain  Causing a collision with Lance Stroll at Turn 1 2 points Aston Martin driver Stroll on soft tyres four laps younger than Gaslys mediums attempted to pass the AlphaTauri driver for 14th place on the 27th lap of the Spanish GP. As he had the use of DRS Gasly defended the inside line approaching Turn 1. Stroll was ahead at entry but as Gasly had the inside they were sidebyside at the apex. But as they exited the corner Gasly understeered into Stroll and pitched him into a spin. He was found wholly at fault for the collision although the collision was more due to a lack of grip and also hit with a fivesecond penalty. Austria  Colliding with Sebastian Vettel at Turn 4 2 points This was another case where Gasly was found wholly at fault after failing to give an Aston Martin  this time driven by Vettel  enough room when being passed around the outside. Vettel was just ahead entering the righthander so the move was on but in attempting to contest the corner Gasly braked a little late and understeered as a result. He tipped Vettel into a spin earning a fivesecond penalty as well as two penalty points. Austria  Leaving the track without reason multiple times 1 point Gasly had four laps deleted for exceeding track limits four times. That earned him a fivesecond penalty served at his second pitstop. Two of the offences were at Turn 10 one at Turn 9 and the fourth one at the first corner with stewards finding no justifiable reason for him doing so. Japan  Speeding under red flag conditions 2 points This is the most controversial of the offences and happened after he pitted at the end of lap one for a nose change having collected an advertising board spat onto the track by Carlos Sainzs accident. Gasly was deemed by the postSuzuka report into the controversy about a recovery tractor being on track in poor visibility to have driven in a reckless manner by not respecting yellow flags. Thats despite being well within the safety car delta which hadnt reset after hed visited the pits. But his penalty was for speeding once the red flags were shown about one second before he passed the tractor. He was found to have exceeded 200kmh 124mph on multiple occasionsand reached 251kmh 156mph at one point. US  Falling more than 10 car lengths behind safety car 2 points Gasly was found to have been significantly more than 10 car lengths behind the car in front under the safety car at Austin. This earned him a fivesecond penalty and two penalty points although Gasly questioned why he had been singled out for it. You arrive at 200kmh 124mph hit the brake down to 60kmh 37mph and at the same time the guy in front of you is hitting the throttle flat out and pulls the gap straight away of 150200 metres said Gasly. On the internet a lot of people are quite curious and managed to find a lot of reviews cases of drivers who did the same under the safety car without penalty. Mexico  Leaving the track and gaining an advantage 1 point Gasly passed Stroll for 15th place on the 13th lap of the Mexican GP at Turn 4. He had the inside line into the corner but locked up on the way in and forced Stroll wide. Stroll took to the runoff while Gasly also exceeded track limits. That meant he was given a penalty for leaving the track and gaining an advantage rather than forcing another driver off track. Had he been found to have committed the latter offence which would have been perfectly legitimate he would have gained an extra penalty point. This list of offences highlights several problems. Firstly speeding under the red flag certainly in the way Gasly did it should be worth more penalty points given the safety implications. That is exactly the kind of dangerous driving that the FIA needs to make completely unacceptable. But the rest of the offences are hardly ones indicative of a dangerous driver. Those at Aston Martin might disagree given three of the incidents involve green cars as the victims but they were honest mistakes in battle rather than egregious examples of incompetent or dirty driving. Gasly should take a close look at the way he handles himself in battle to cut back on such incidents and that will benefit both himself and those around him. Whats more he should avoid getting too deep into the mindset that hes being persecuted by the stewards even if his penalty for dropping too far behind the car ahead under the safety car at Austin was incredibly harsh. But he hardly needs the reality check either of a onerace ban or the threat of it. Its not impossible Gasly will get through the next nine events without picking up another two penalty points and that will certainly be his aim. If he does so you could argue the system works as the Sword of Damocles hanging over him might have forced him to modify his ontrack behaviour. But theres a good chance he will commit another offence. That could potentially create a troubling situation whereby the stewards are reluctant to issue penalty points. And as theres little room in the way this is done that might even impact the offences he gets penalised for. That doesnt mean hell not be penalised but it was notable that he was hit with an offence that came with just one penalty point for the Turn 4 incident with Stroll in Mexico rather than being done for forcing him off track which comes with two points. Brown calls for F1 stewards to be fulltime  Why arent they Read more This is connected to the wider question of F1 stewarding. The case for permanent stewards is a strong one and would make it easier for increased flexibility within the penalty points issued to differentiate between what you might call runofthemill incidents and minor errors and those that are more problematic and that collectively indicate a problematic pattern of behaviour. Its all well and good to have guidelines but creating a set menu of points for certain offences has turned what is meant to be a system to tackle those rare cases of those who cannot or will not handle themselves safely on track into an inflexible blunt instrument. If Gaslys rap sheet was more problematic there would be no such concerns. But his situation highlights that while the superlience penalty points system needs to exist its current form is flawed and needs reform.
Formula 1's battle for final 2023 seat: Haas set to choose between Mick Schumacher and Nico Hulkenberg, https://www.skysports.com/f1/news/32133/12736562/formula-1s-battle-for-final-2023-seat-haas-set-to-choose-between-mick-schumacher-and-nico-hulkenberg, Formula 1s battle for final 2023 seat Haas set to choose between Mick Schumacher and Nico HulkenbergMick Schumacher and Nico Hulkenberg are battling it out for a 2023 F1 seat with HaasThe battle for the final Formula 1 seat on the 2023 grid appears to be a straight fight between Mick Schumacher and Nico Hulkenberg with Haas hoping to make a decision before the end of the season. For me its about whats best for the Haas team in the medium to long term. Steiner also reportedly told the German outlet that it was between only Schumacher and Nico Hulkenberg.

All nine other teams  providing Logan Sargeant gets enough super license points to join Williams  have finalised their driver lineups for next year and so all eyes are on Haas with Schumacher no longer the certainty he once seemed to seal another chance alongside Kevin Magnussen. Schumacher the son of F1 legend Michael has been steady but not spectacular since making his muchanticipated debut in F1 in 2021 and has also attracted criticism from his team for his numerous crashes. One of the major pulls for the German meanwhile was that he was a Ferrari junior but the 23yearold is losing his ties to Ferrari Haas engine providers and major partners at the end of this year. Schumacher is still regarded as the favourite for the seat but with Magnussen both outscoring and outqualifying him Haas boss Guenther Steiner recently admitted it was 5050 whether he would remain with the team or not.

Steiner also reportedly told the German outlet that it was between only Schumacher and Nico Hulkenberg. Hulkenberg 35 is a wellknown name in F1 and a wellrespected driver with 181 race starts to his name.

Steiner while looking for the medium to long term has also made it clear he wants his next driver to be a leader. Mick has got some experience obviously its his second year in Formula 1 he said.

Hamilton is out of contract at the end of next season when hell be 38 years old. Another twoyear deal would take him past his 40th birthday. But the seventime champion has showed no signs of slowing down in his 16th season despite the downturn in Mercedess competitiveness thats left him facing the first winless campaign of his career. Watch every practice qualifying and race of the 2022 FIA Formula One World Championship live on Kayo. New to Kayo Start your free trial now  Ahead of anticipated talks over the 202223 offseason Hamilton said he wanted to stay with Mercedes for at least two more years beyond the end of his current deal. Im not putting a limit on it to be honest he said per Autosport. Im planning to do a multiyear deal with my team. I think theres more stuff to achieve together. I just dont know how long. Mercedes boss Toto Wolff said earlier in the season that Hamilton had told him he had another five years in him and speaking at the Mexico City Grand Prix he revealed he expected talks to start after the seasonending race in Abu Dhabi. We havent started any talks he said per Crash. We want to definitely finish the season and then find some quiet time over the winter like we did last time around. Wolff also suggested a new deal would see an expansion of Hamiltons offtrack partnership with the team a key component of his previous deal which has seen team and driver commit to diversity targets within the organisation and Formula 1 more broadly. Hes much more than a driver to us now Wolff said. And although were not talking about a career end its also important to speak about his role as an ambassador for Mercedes and the many sponsors we have and the implication he can have in our wider universe. An extended Lewis Hamilton stay would be a potential spanner in the works for Daniel Ricciardo who is heavily tipped to sign for Mercedes next year as a reserve driver before attempting a fulltime comeback in 2024. Mercedes is the only one of the three frontrunning teams with a seat out of contract in 2024 with both Hamilton and teammate George Russell up for renewal before the end of next season. Candid Ricciardo reveals 2023 plans  0038 Russell is considered the future of the team and a shooin for a renewal after his strong maiden season with the team leaving Hamilton as the only potential avenue into a silver race seat though the Briton has now closed off that route with talk of a new deal. Ricciardo however insists that a decision to sign as a reserve driver wouldnt be dependent on a race seat freeing up in the following season. I dont think its relative to what others do he said. Opportunities will arise when they do. Im not banking on anyone doing something so I can find my way. I want to take the time necessary keep a little bit of distance to the sport and rebuild myself but then if something makes sense in 2024 come back with a vengeance and have some fun and hopefully race at the front. The Australian said he hopes Hamilton resigns so that he might have another chance to race him in a potential career revival. The truth is I want him to stay in the sport he said. Hes one of the greatest ever to do it and I think competing with him going wheel to wheel with him is fun. Its normally at the pointy end so I certainly wish to do that more in the future and thats where it currently lies. World champion Jenson Button has cast doubt on Ricciardos plan for a year out in light of offers from lower order teams to keep in racing in 2023. I really struggle to see him coming back to a competitive team after having a year out he told Sky Sports.

Options narrow for Ricciardo's Formula 1 future, https://www.speedcafe.com/2022/11/03/options-narrow-for-ricciardos-formula-1-future/, There look to be just two potential berths if Daniel Ricciardo is to remain in Formula 1 in 2023. Reserve Drivers perform a variety of functions for teams differing slightly for each but fundamentally offering the same services. Options for Ricciardo as a Reserve Driver are therefore limited. As you know as well we also have an agreement with other teams to share Reserve Drivers. Such a move would also be consistent with Ricciardos own statements where he asserted his future was not contingent on anyone else., There look to be just two potential berths if Daniel Ricciardo is to remain in Formula 1 in 2023. The Australian will not be in a race drive next year but is known to be interested in a Reserve Driver role should a suitable option be available. Following confirmation of Stoffel Vandoorne at Aston Martin earlier this week those potential employers have been further reduced. Reserve Drivers perform a variety of functions for teams differing slightly for each but fundamentally offering the same services. Most visible is their role in the garage listening in to the radio during sessions and taking part in debriefs thereafter. They are at the circuit as a potential shortnotice replacement and are often given time in the car during testing to bring them up to speed with the systems and fundamentals of the machine. This will often see them at events on a Friday before travelling back to base that afternoon ahead of a long night at the factory. There they work in the simulator to refine and develop car setup over a race weekend. The biggest teams will employ multiple simulator drivers with their focus on evaluating different setup options and recommending changes ahead of Saturdays Free Practice 3. Beyond that the Reserve Driver interacts with guests and is an ambassador for the team at public events speaking to the Paddock Club and so on. Typically there are two different types of drivers employed in those roles high potential youngsters who are being groomed for a possible race drive in future or race drivers whose active careers have come to an end. There are exceptions but by and large the bulk of drivers Vandoorne included fall into one of those buckets. Indeed Aston Martin is a perfect microcosm of that the team also employs Formula 2 championelect Felipe Drugovich. Vandoorne had been in a Reserve Driver role at Mercedes since 2020 coupling that with his drive for the threepointed star in Formula E. His exit along with that of Nyck de Vries who will join Scuderia AlphaTauri as race driver for 2023 leaves the AngloGerman operation without a nominated Reserve Driver for 2023. It is one of just three drivers in that position the others being McLaren and Alpine. Options for Ricciardo as a Reserve Driver are therefore limited. Sources have confirmed to Speedcafe.com that he is in discussions with a top team for an opportunity from which we can safely eliminate much of the field. We can further eliminate teams based on their stated positions with McLaren and Alpine having voiced those. Andreas Seidl Team Principal at McLaren has admitted that his team would be open to the concept but no conversations have been had on the notion. Thats a discussion we didnt have yet he said when asked of the possibility by Speedcafe.com. Its a discussion we usually have in winter. As you know as well we also have an agreement with other teams to share Reserve Drivers. Again theres absolutely no hard or bad feelings between Daniel and us and therefore in general I think its possible. At Alpine Otmar Szafnauer all but ruled out the Australians return to Enstone in a Reserve Driver capacity. We havent made that decision yet Szafnauer said of who will step into the role currently officially held by Piastri. But to be fair to Daniel we havent been talking to him about a reserve role. Given that we can logically whittle the list of potential employers to three Mercedes Red Bull and Ferrari. The latter has traditionally favoured its internal programme. It has Robert Shwartzman within its ranks already as well as the experienced Antonio Giovinazzi. In that scenario what does Ricciardo offer that the team does not already have A berth at Ferrari is therefore unlikely. Red Bull on the other hand is a possibility. It has Formula 2 race winner Liam Lawson as its nextinline youngster but when the opportunity presented to move him into a race drive Red Bull instead opted to go outside of its junior programme to recruit Nyck de Vries. Its not a huge vote of confidence in the young New Zealander who has just a handful of test outings in a Formula 1 car to his name. The squad also has Sebastien Buemi though the World Endurance Champions Formula 1 experience is somewhat dated. There is then something of a hole in the squads structure especially when one considers it has four drivers to protect Max Verstappen Sergio Perez Yuki Tsunoda and for 2023 de Vries. It would therefore make sense to bring in an experienced driver at a currently very affordable rate to mitigate that risk while also adding contemporary knowledge to the simulator programme. Of course its need is lower than Mercedes given it at least has Lawson on hand should he be needed. Given Vandoorne and de Vries have both moved on the Brackleybased operation has nobody to back up Lewis Hamilton and George Russell. It has the greatest need of a driver and of those on the market Ricciardo has the best credentials by some considerable distance. Such a move would also be consistent with Ricciardos own statements where he asserted his future was not contingent on anyone else. My future will be lets say I dont think its relative to what others do he said last month when Speedcafe.com asked about his future and Hamiltons intention to carry on beyond 2023. Opportunities will arise when they do but Im not banking on anyone doing something so I can find my way. I want to take the time necessary keep a little bit of distance to the sport and rebuild myself. But then yeah if something makes make sense in 24 come back with a vengeance and have some fun and hopefully race at the front.

As of Wednesday afternoon the lowest price available for a Thursday through Sunday stay was 752 per night at The Linq Hotel  not including taxes and resort fees. Room rates at Caesars Palace were the highest at 1519 per night. Caesars Entertainment Inc. opened its booking portal on Monday for that weekend.

The first tickets for the 2023 Formula One Las Vegas Grand Prix went on sale Tuesday with ticket packages ranging between 500 and 10000 before taxes and fees. Room prices are dynamic and are likely to change depending on demand. But resort operators are bullish that theyll be able to fetch a high price for the week which is usually considered a soft week for visitation to the city. We think Formula One is a different animal Caesars CEO Tom Reeg said Tuesday during an investors call. The demand for that particular event is well beyond what we were expecting. As you saw the rates roll out Monday the pricing reflects that. Amanda Belarmino assistant professor at UNLVs William F. Harrah College of Hospitality said a common pricing practice is to start high and see whether demand is strong enough to sell at that price point. Its better to not leave money on the table Belarmino said. You can always discount if needed but first you can see what the market will hold. High prices on the Strip during special events are not unusual. Resorts are also likely researching pricing in other markets that have hosted onetime major events such as the Olympics Super Bowl and other Formula One races she said. Plus hotels often block off rooms for loyalty members  like MGMs promotion  which further drives up the value of any remaining available rooms. Given Formula Ones large fanbase abroad Belarmino expects there will be many international travelers who are less price sensitive because of the events uniqueness. The pricing also suggests that resorts are expecting consumers who typically dont come to Las Vegas. The prices do signal If youre not here for F1 then come some other time she said. The whole city will be geared around this event regardless of the price. If you want to see what it has to offer on a regular basis come another time when its going to be geared more towards you.

Jenson Button warns Daniel Ricciardo he could be ruining his Formula One career with huge mistake, https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-11383315/Jenson-Button-warns-Daniel-Ricciardo-ruining-Formula-One-career-huge-mistake.html, Former F1 world champion Jenson Button has warned Daniel Ricciardo his plan to become a reserve driver in 2023 instead of taking a seat with a backfield team could do irreparable damage to his career. Ricciardo has been linked to a reserve position with Mercedes and Red Bull next season  a move Button believes would make it extremely difficult for him to return to drive for a top team again. But I still think it would have been a better move for him  go into a team work hard show people what you can do in a car that maybe suits you a bit more and then people forget what happened the year before. Its a tricky one and I really struggle to see him coming back to a competitive team after having a year out. And with the calendar being so long it was hard to remove yourself from what was happening in the racing., Former F1 world champion Jenson Button has warned Daniel Ricciardo his plan to become a reserve driver in 2023 instead of taking a seat with a backfield team could do irreparable damage to his career. The Australian has been dropped by McLaren after failing to find form with the famous English outfit and recently exclusively revealed to Daily Mail that he wants a little distance from the sport so he can rebuild himself after two years of shocking results. Ricciardo has been linked to a reserve position with Mercedes and Red Bull next season  a move Button believes would make it extremely difficult for him to return to drive for a top team again. The struggling Aussie star has confessed he wants to put some space between himself and the sport next year as hes been connected to a reserve role with Mercedes or Red Bull Exworld champ Jenson Button pictured with wife Brittny believes stepping back from the starting grid will make it very hard for Ricciardo to return to driving for a top team I guess he didnt want to drop too far down the grid and work with a team thats more towards the rear because its difficult for a driver coming from a team that is almost wining races at times to suddenly know youre fighting for points Button said on Sky Sports. It is tough. But I still think it would have been a better move for him  go into a team work hard show people what you can do in a car that maybe suits you a bit more and then people forget what happened the year before. But sitting out People just remember what happened last year. Its a tricky one and I really struggle to see him coming back to a competitive team after having a year out. Ricciardos desire to put some distance between himself and the sport stems from how badly hes been affected by his struggles this season and last. Despite a thrilling run to seventh in the Mexico Grand Prix that earned him Driver of the Day honours Ricciardo sits a lowly 12th in this years drivers standings with just 29 points to his name  far behind teammate Lando Norris whos coming seventh with 109. Ricciardo pictured at the Mexico Grand Prix had to speak to a psychologist last year as his shocking run of form at McLaren took its toll My confidence was being eaten away driving a car that wouldnt dance with me and would bite back Ricciardo told Daily Mail. Whenever we thought we would found a solution along would come another set of challenges. When you put so much into something and it doesnt work out there is sadness. It gets to you. Last year it affected me a little bit too much. I wouldnt be my usual bubbly self. I would be reluctant if someone said lets go out for dinner. I would need some cajoling. I let it get to me. I started to speak to a psychologist last year  the most challenging year I have had. Racing is very much results driven and dictates your Sunday happiness. I was neglecting friendships and thought it would be good to talk to someone to make sure the two sides of my life didnt cross over. Its like all things you need perspective. And with the calendar being so long it was hard to remove yourself from what was happening in the racing.
Mika Hakkinen agrees with Toto Wolff on Red Bull's F1 cost cap punishment, https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/hakkinen-wolff-red-bull-punishment-28394694, Mercedes team principal Wolff gave a specific reason why his team will not risk breaking cost cap rules in the future and F1 champion Hakkinen believes the Austrian made a good pointDouble Formula 1 world champion Mika Hakkinen does not believe any team will be willing to break cost cap rules after Red Bull were slapped with a significant punishment. Red Bull overspent during the 2021 season and agreed not to fight the penalty imposed by the FIA. That point of view has been backed up by Hakkinen who feels the cost cap rules still have teeth. The first thing to say is that I am glad this matter is now closed and the FIAs penalty accepted by Red Bull the Finn wrote in his Unibet column. Red Bulls penalty for the minor overspend is still significant., Mercedes team principal Wolff gave a specific reason why his team will not risk breaking cost cap rules in the future and F1 champion Hakkinen believes the Austrian made a good point Double Formula 1 world champion Mika Hakkinen does not believe any team will be willing to break cost cap rules after Red Bull were slapped with a significant punishment. Red Bull overspent during the 2021 season and agreed not to fight the penalty imposed by the FIA. The team was fined 6m and will lose 10 of their aerodynamic testing time over the next 12 months as punishment for breaching budget cap regulations. The punishment divided opinion among others as some felt justice had been served and other worried that it might not be enough to prevent others from willingly breaking the rules in the future now a precedent has been set. Asked for his opinion by Mirror Sport team boss Christian Horner said it is a strong deterrent adding  Anyone who diminishes that penalty doesnt know what theyre talking about. Reacting to the punishment Mercedes chief Toto Wolff explained that the threat of reputational damage would be enough to deter his team from willingly overspending. Whatever team you are youre responsible for representing a brand your employees and your partners and thats why for us it wouldnt be something they would do said the Austrian. That point of view has been backed up by Hakkinen who feels the cost cap rules still have teeth. The first thing to say is that I am glad this matter is now closed and the FIAs penalty accepted by Red Bull the Finn wrote in his Unibet column. With technical and sporting regulations you generally have a clear decision for example if the car is under the weight limit or a driver goes outside the track limits but with the financial regulations there was always likely to be a grey area. Image Formula 1 via Getty Images Formula 1 via Getty Images I think that is why everyone accepted two levels to breaking the budget cap  a minor or major overspend. The FIA recognised that there could be various levels of overspend and reasons for doing so. Red Bulls penalty for the minor overspend is still significant. Far more than the financial or aerodynamic penalty it has been an uncomfortable experience for the team. The good thing is that no team will want to risk repeating this next year so although it has been a very difficult and controversial moment for Red Bull I believe it will benefit F1 in the long term because every team boss will be determined not to have this kind of negative publicity in future. Speaking about the criticism he and his team faced in the wake of the cost cap breach Horner explained We have taken a public pounding from the accusations that other teams have made. Weve had our drivers booed at circuits. The reputational damage has been significant and the time for that to stop is now and move on.

Piero Ferrari Binotto lead tributes to legendary F1 engineer Forghieri, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/piero-ferrari-f1-binotto-tributes-forghieri/10394301/, On the teams website Piero Ferrari recalled mediating between his father and Forghieri. While Mauro Forghieri taken on a few years earlier was next door. We mourn the passing of Mauro Forghieri one of the most amazing people to have worked here. Current head of GT sporting activities Antonello Coletta said Mauro Forghieri played a key role in fuelling the history of Ferrari. Enzo Ferrari claimed to be an agitator of men and I think we can say that Forghieri was an agitator of ideas., Listen to this article Forghieri is widely regarded as one of the key players in the history of Scuderia Ferrari having been a team manager and both a chassis and engine designer with the Maranello outfit. His stint with the company lasted from 1959 to 1987 encompassing some of its most memorable successes. He is credited with an involvement in 54 race wins and 11 world championships. On the teams website Piero Ferrari recalled mediating between his father and Forghieri. When I joined the company in 1965 I shared an office with Cavalier Giberti Ferraris first employee he said. While Mauro Forghieri taken on a few years earlier was next door. We were therefore separated by 10 years of age and a window. In fact we saw each other all day every day. Forghieri was energetic and passionate about everything he did. He was sanguine and I recall that in many of those interminable meetings at the Gestione Sportiva that started in the evening and went on into the night I mediated between him and my father. I know my father appreciated his tireless work ethic and he knew that any mistakes only came about through an attempt to do something better and to look ahead. We have lost a part of our history a man who gave a great deal to Ferrari and to the world of racing in general. Chris Amon Ferrari 312 Mauro Forghieri chief engineer Ferrari founder and owner Enzo Ferrari Photo by Motorsport Images Binotto noted that Forghieri was a great motivator with a charismatic personality. Today is a very sad day for everyone at Scuderia Ferrari he said. We mourn the passing of Mauro Forghieri one of the most amazing people to have worked here. He was appointed as team manager at the age of 27 and with his brilliant insights he was one of the last allround engineers in the car world. I met him on various occasions and each time was something special. He was to the end a truly charismatic individual. His revolutionary ideas together with his vibrant nature his abilities as a great motivator meant he played a very important role in some of the most significant moments of Ferraris history and he did more than most to fuel the Prancing Horse legend. We will all miss him. Forghieri was also very much involved in Ferraris sportscar racing programme which was shelved in the early 1970s. Current head of GT sporting activities Antonello Coletta said Mauro Forghieri played a key role in fuelling the history of Ferrari. Enzo Ferrari claimed to be an agitator of men and I think we can say that Forghieri was an agitator of ideas. He was a brilliant innovator capable of coming up with technical solutions that eluded most of the engineers of his day. He was a designer who went beyond his defined role who became a benchmark and a source of inspiration for everyone who worked with him. He was an eclectic designer and his curiosity and desire to push the boundaries sealed his place in the history of Ferrari and motorsport in general.
OBITUARY: Mauro Forghieri technical genius behind some of Formula 1’s greatest Ferraris remembered, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.obituary-mauro-forghieri-technical-genius-behind-some-of-formula-1s-greatest.67IR5vwYq73vG9mhaKYd3N.html, Mauro Forghieri who has died at 87 found himself thrust into the F1 limelight in 1962 at the tender age of 26. He later worked directly for Alfa and Mauro went to school in Milan. He himself had gatecrashed some Ferrari lunches where driver Clemente Biondetti a fourtime Mille Miglia winner had become his hero. His was thus an allround education in the racing world learning at the feet of the spirited technical director Carlo Chiti. There was excitement when Ayrton Senna tested the engine for McLaren and was impressed with it as a potential replacement for the Honda V12 engine they were due to lose for 1993., Mauro Forghieri who has died at 87 found himself thrust into the F1 limelight in 1962 at the tender age of 26. His grandfather Anselmo was a passionate and committed socialist who was a friend of Mussolini and Sandro Pertini the socialist politician who went on to become the president of Italy from 1978 to 1985. His father Reclus trained at the Fermo Corni Technical Industrial Institute and worked with Enzo Ferrari in 1937 and 38 in Milan during the conception of the Alfa Romeo 158 which went on to claim the first two official Drivers World Championships in 1950 and 51. He later worked directly for Alfa and Mauro went to school in Milan. Separated by the war the Forghieri family was reunited when hostilities ceased and after working for a while on classic cars while living between Nice and Monaco on the French Riviera Reclus returned to Modena and went to work as a toolmaker at Ferrari where he remained until 1973. READ MORE Under the bodywork of the Ferrari 312B3 Mauro who shared his grandfathers and fathers penchant for passionate selfexpression was raised there then educated at Bologna University where he graduated in 1959 with a doctorate in mechanical engineering. He revealed that his father had been only slightly interested in racing as the Mille Miglia had actually passed by their front door. He himself had gatecrashed some Ferrari lunches where driver Clemente Biondetti a fourtime Mille Miglia winner had become his hero. He had done an internship at Ferrari in 1957 but his knowledge of Formula 1 was minimal and after an initial leaning towards teaching he then considered emigrating to California to work for a company making aircraft turbine engines. But Enzo Ferrari himself was insistent that he should follow his father into the company. Soon he became involved in myriad engineering projects learning not just about engines but gearboxes chassis and suspension. His was thus an allround education in the racing world learning at the feet of the spirited technical director Carlo Chiti. Forghieri back to camera stayed with Ferrari after an exodus of personnel including Carlo Chiti L  who designed the Sharknose cars The big break came on October 30 1961. At that time Ferrari had won the World Championship with Phil Hill and the Sharknose 156. In a reverse palace coup Chiti and team manager Romolo Tavoni and most of the design staff had quit. Tired of Laura Ferrari Enzos wifes endless meddling they had formed Automobili Turismo e Sport ATS in Sasso Marconi in Bologna with financial backing from industrialists Jaime Ortiz Patino Giorgio Billi and Count Giovanni Volpi. Hill went with them and when the venture failed his career was left in ruins. It was a Monday Forghieri recalled. My life was turned around completely. Ferrari called me and got straight to the point. He said From this moment on you are responsible for all the motor sport activity and testing. I was amazed agog but I was able to maintain a certain lucidity he admitted. But as he pointed out immediately to Il Commendatore he was only 26 and had zero experience. READ MORE Legendary Ferrari engineer Mauro Forghieri passes away aged 87 Moreover while Ferrari had gained the jump on the dominant British teams Lotus Cooper and BRM when they refused initially to accept that the new 1.5litre formula really would happen in 1961 by 1962 with new V8 engines and in Lotuss case the groundbreaking bathtub monocoque chassis they had caught up and exposed Ferraris inherent weaknesses. His was thus a Herculean task but by 1963 he had persuaded Ferrari to employ John Surtees whose talent together with Chris Amons in later years he believed to be the equal of Jim Clarks. By 1964 Surtees had taken Ferrari to the Drivers and Constructors World Championships and though the subsequent series of 312 cars were necessarily born around an elderly 3litre V12 sportcar engine from 1966 and only won three races between that year and 1969 the flat12 engine he commissioned Franco Rocchi Franco to create for 1970 led to a rebirth when installed in his own 312B chassis. Forghieri with the Daytonawinning 330 P4 one of the revered P series of Scuderia sports cars Jacky Ickx narrowly lost out on the title that year but by 1974 Ferrari was back on track with Niki Lauda and Clay Regazzoni winning races. Lauda went on to win Drivers titles in 1975 and 77 after missing out narrowly to James Hunt in 1976 and Ferrari won the Constructors titles in all three years. He designed the transversal transmission that helped to create the cars excellent weight distribution from 1975 onwards. Jody Scheckter aided by Gilles Villeneuve added two more titles in 1979 and the turbocharged 126 cars of 1982 and 83 likewise won Constructors laurels as British designer Harvey Postlethwaite was engaged to work alongside Forghieri. Polemics were always a crucial part of Ferrari given the passionate support of the tifosi and the aggression of an Italian media that was intolerant of anything other than success. Ferrari scored but a single victory in 1984 and by 1985 the politics within the team obliged Ferrari to move Mauro sideways as face was saved by appointing him director of Ferraris advanced research office and Harvey was left in sole charge of F1 engineering. Mauro endured this new regime working from January 1985 on the 408 4RM concept car until it was completed in May 1987 whereupon he finally left the Scuderia to take on the role of technical director of the newly formed Lamborghini Engineering. Lamborghini had been bought by Chryslers Lee Iacocca that year and he wanted an F1 engine to help sell its roadgoing supercars. Company boss Daniele Audetto had worked with Forghieri while he was team manager at Ferrari and they worked well together as Mauro designed a normallyaspirated V12 engine for the new 3.5litre formula which came into force for 1989. It would power a Lola entered by Gerard Larrousses team. The engine was shown to the media in April 1988 and ran for the first time at Dijon in December in a Larrousse Lola driven by Philippe Alliot. It showed potential though the best result was just a sixth for Alliot in the Spanish GP. The engine was used by Larrousse and Lola for 1990 the best results being a thirdplaced podium for Aguri Suzuki for the former in Japan plus sixths in Britain and Spain and fifth in Hungary and sixth in Canada for Derek Warwick for the latter. Forghieri who designed the innovative 312 T series with Lauda L Agreement was reached for Lamborghini Engineering to design a bespoke car powered by the V12 engine for Mexican businessman Fernando Gonzalez Lunas new team for 1991. Forghieri oversaw the project as Mario Tolentino drew the Glas 001 but when Luna disappeared in June 1990 and the nascent team succumbed Audetto convinced Italian financier Carlo Patrucco to take over the project and Mauro was appointed technical director of the new Modena Teams Lambo 291. The arrangement proved shortlived and he was back at Lamborghini Engineering developing the V12 further until he was replaced by Mike Rice after a shakeup. There was excitement when Ayrton Senna tested the engine for McLaren and was impressed with it as a potential replacement for the Honda V12 engine they were due to lose for 1993. In the end however that deal came to nothing. Mauro designed an electric minivan for Enel in 1992 and was appointed technical director of Bugatti Automobili where he developed the EB110 and 112 models before leaving to found Oral Engineering in Modena with Franco Antoniazzi and Sergio Lugli early in 1995. His work there embraced the design research and development of automobile motorcycle marine and gokart engines for clients such as BMW Bugatti and Aprilia and turning the Ferrari Pinin concept car into a pukka roadworthy vehicle. Later he was chief engineer in the mid2000s on the Project 1221 MF1 sports car. He was also one of the technical experts called to court during the official investigation into the death of Ayrton Senna at Imola on May 1 that year. Forghieri oversaw the creation of the Bugatti EB110

Speaking to selected media including Motorsport.com Hamilton said We are going to do another deal. Were going to sit down and were going to discuss it in these next couple of months I would say. Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff says his squad is not looking for anyone else as the seat was 100 percent Hamiltons. However he felt that there was no rush to get things settled immediately  and that it would be easier to sort things out including wider responsibilities beyond driving once the season was finished. We havent started having talks explained Wolff. We want to definitely finish the season and then find some quiet time over the winter like we have done last time around that literally started in the winter holidays and lasted over two months. We havent done that. But hes much more than a driver to us now. Although were not talking about a career end its also important to speak about his role as an ambassador for Mercedes and the many sponsors that we have and the implication he can have in our wider audience.

They stuck with me through everything that was going on through 2020. Theyve stuck with me through my mistakes and shit thats been in the press theyve stuck with me through the ups and downs.

And I want to be the best teammate I can be to them because I think we can make the brand even better more accessible even stronger than it is. And I think I can be an integral part of that.
Doohan ‘more than ready’ for F1 chance after Mexico cameo, https://www.foxsports.com.au/motorsport/formula-one/doohan-more-than-ready-for-f1-chance-after-mexico-cameo/news-story/be3148ddd135ac0410fcef33c0460826, Aussie rising star Jack Doohan has his sights firmly set on Formula 1 after getting his first taste of a grand prix weekend in Mexico City. Doohan took part in first practice at the Mexico City Grand Prix as the most senior member of Alpines junior driver academy standing in for Esteban Ocon. Another practice session is also on his horizon at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix as part of the teams efforts to better embed him into its grand prix operation and Doohan said it was part of the plan to ready him for his eventual F1 debut.

Doohan took part in first practice at the Mexico City Grand Prix as the most senior member of Alpines junior driver academy standing in for Esteban Ocon. It was the culmination of his junior program with the team that has so far featured three private tests in last years car as well as 100 kilometres in the current Alpine for a filming day. Watch every practice qualifying and race of the 2022 FIA Formula One World Championship live on Kayo. New to Kayo Start your free trial now  The 19yearold has impressed in his standout rookie Formula 2 campaign this season sitting fourth in the championship with three wins including in the feature race at SpaFrancorchamps. He could finish in the top three depending on results at the final round of the year. He was briefly considered for a sudden elevation to Formula 1 for next season when both Fernando Alonso and Oscar Piastri defected from the team during the midseason break but Alpine instead signed Pierre Gasly giving Doohan a second campaign in Formula 2 to hone his craft. Another practice session is also on his horizon at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix as part of the teams efforts to better embed him into its grand prix operation and Doohan said it was part of the plan to ready him for his eventual F1 debut. Im just trying to prepare myself as much as possible and kind of maximise what I can do  learn as much from the team and try and really embed myself with the team so if the opportunity does arise to get in the car or become a fulltime driver Im more than ready he told select media including Fox Sports. Thats what Alpine are helping me to do and really thats the plan. Im part of their future which Im a very thankful for. This is the plan to obviously win Formula 2 next year as well as be in the best possible position to see what the future holds. NASCAR driver uses wall to advantage  0126 Its a role similar to that held by Piastri before he split with the team. That process remains ongoing with McLaren so far signalling that it doesnt expect to get access to the Australian until next year. But despite Piastri being shuffled towards the exit Doohan said he hadnt yet been given his compatriots reservedriver status for this season or next. I havent had any clarification on that he said. An Alpine spokesperson added that an announcement on reserve drivers would be made in due course. Regardless of the formalities theres no doubt Doohans path to Formula 1 has opened dramatically in the last 12 months. His decision at the end of last year to switch to the Alpine program from Red Bulls junior academy  which is much celebrated but held at arms length from Red Bull Racing  has paid dividends in terms of his connectedness to a Formula 1 team and the active development hes receiving. Its also put him in a prime position to capitalise from the turmoil in Alpines driver roster elevating him to the top of the junior program just as the best of his Formula 2 results started to flow. Verstappen claims another win Ric 7th  0235 Asked whether he could see his route into Formula 1 Doohan said he was confident. For sure I see that he said. The possibility is there. I just need to obviously keep on working doing the best that I possibly can and keep working with Alpine because theyve been honestly amazing to me. Im really proud to be part of the team and I hope to be a part of their future and in the long plan because from just working with the team in the past two events and my short periods while in F2 we have amazing potential here. Good things are 100 per cent coming so to be part of it in the future should be really cool. Theyve helped me so much from joining the academy in January to doing my first FP1 session now in October so theyre looking after me really well. I cant wait to repay the favour hopefully in years to come.

Ive watched the event on TV for many years and I came so close to competing last year until I had to pull out at the last minute. It was tough watching everyone having so much fun throwing their cars around on the snow and ice in Sweden so Im glad I will now be joining them at Pite Havsbad in January. The Finnish driver was set to make his debut in the 2022 iteration of the Race Of Champions but pulled out days before the competition. This season he has again planned to compete alongside compatriot and twotime F1 champion Mika Hakkinen in the ROC Nations Cup on January 28 and the individual Race Of Champions on January 29. Im also thrilled to be able to partner Mika Hakkinen for Team Finland in the ROC Nations Cup. I have become good friends with Mika over the years but it will be a special treat to be able to race alongside him. Weve both taken part in the Arctic Rally a few times so hopefully that can help us beat our Nordic neighbours  and everyone else. Then well have to put our friendship aside again and try to beat each other in the individual Race Of Champions. Whatever happens Im sure we will put on a great show for all the fans watching at the track and around the world.

As for the secret to success I might tell Valtteri before the ROC Nations Cup but only if he promises to have forgotten it by the individual race the next day
Will Red Bull's punishment deter future F1 cost cap breaches?, https://www.crash.net/f1/feature/1016171/1/will-red-bull-s-punishment-deter-future-f1-cost-cap-breaches, Red Bull have been fined 7m and docked 10 percent of their aerodynamic testing time for the next 12 months after their submitted accounts were found to be 1.6 percent over the 145m spending limit set during Max Verstappens titlewinning 2021 campaign. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner described a 10 percent aero research reduction for an 0.37 overspend as draconian but said his team begrudgingly accepted the sanction for the good of the sport. Asked whether the punishment was strong enough to prevent Mercedes from purposely committing a breach in future Toto Wolff argued the reputational damage Red Bull sustained was a big enough deterrent. Mike Krack whose Aston Martin team were fined 450000 after striking their own ABA for procedural infringements of the cost cap insists the FIA must be trusted to govern fairly and properly. This is for the FIA to judge Krack said when asked if he thinks the penalty strengthens the budget cap., Red Bull have been fined 7m and docked 10 percent of their aerodynamic testing time for the next 12 months after their submitted accounts were found to be 1.6 percent over the 145m spending limit set during Max Verstappens titlewinning 2021 campaign. The FIA ruled there were 13 areas where Red Bull had wrongly excluded costs which amounted to an overspend of 1.8m however F1s governing body acknowledged the team would have exceeded the cap by only 432652 had they not omitted a tax credit in their submission. Is Hamilton No Longer the Best Wet Weather Driver Video of Is Hamilton No Longer the Best Wet Weather Driver Red Bull team principal Christian Horner described a 10 percent aero research reduction for an 0.37 overspend as draconian but said his team begrudgingly accepted the sanction for the good of the sport. With rivals including Ferrari and McLaren publicly expressing their displeasure at the size of the penalty questions were raised as to whether the FIAs verdict would draw a line under the case or open up a new can of worms. Asked whether the punishment was strong enough to prevent Mercedes from purposely committing a breach in future Toto Wolff argued the reputational damage Red Bull sustained was a big enough deterrent. I think what you see is that beyond the sporting penalty and the financial fine theres also a reputational damage and in a world of transparency and good governance thats just not on anymore Wolff told Sky Sports. And compliancewise in whatever team you are youre responsible for representing a brand your employees your partners and thats why for us it wouldnt be a business case. For Ferrari question marks still remain. Ferrari racing director Laurent Mekies was sceptical about Horners claims and the overall impact of the penalty suggesting Red Bulls Accepted Breach Agreement with the FIA simply encourages money that could have been detracted from their budget to be spent elsewhere. We at Ferrari do not understand how the 10 reduction of the ATA can correspond to the same amount of lap time Mekies told Sky Sports Italia. Furthermore there is another problem in that since there is no budget cap reduction in the penalty the basic effect is to push the competitor to spend the money elsewhere. It has total freedom to use the money it can no longer spend on use of the wind tunnel and CFD due to the 10 reduction on reducing the weight of the car or who knows what else. Our concern is that the combination of these two factors means the real effect of the penalty is very limited. Time to close the chapter Other teams believe it is the end of the matter  for now at least. Mike Krack whose Aston Martin team were fined 450000 after striking their own ABA for procedural infringements of the cost cap insists the FIA must be trusted to govern fairly and properly. This is for the FIA to judge Krack said when asked if he thinks the penalty strengthens the budget cap. I think there has been enough polemics around the whole topic about how big the fine has to be. I think we should now look to the front and not back and discuss who had which fine and if it was large enough or not. The FIA is in charge of doing that. We have to trust that they do that correctly and respect that. Despite dismissing Red Bulls claim that their penalty could cost them up to half a second in laptime next season Alfa Romeo team principal Fred Vasseur echoed Wolffs view that brand damage alone would stop teams from making the same mistake. The biggest punishment for a team is to accept that they were overspending in terms of image and we dont have to underestimate this one  for your employees for your sponsors and so on Vasseur explained. I think its very good to reach the end of the discussion to have a clear picture of the FIA to have a clear decision from the FIA to have an agreement from the team also this will help to close the chapter. Then if you speak about technical or sporting decisions or penalties its a bit different for me because Im not sure we are making half a second with 10 per cent of your allocation or we are very stupid. Horner highlighted the matter could have dragged on for months had Red Bull challenged the FIA and decided to take things as far as the FIAs International Court of Appeal. Concerns have also been raised about how long the auditing process took as well as the prospect for F1 to be facing a case of deja vu when the results of teams spending for 2022 are revealed. To avoid another potential cost cap saga this time next year teams have urged F1 and the FIA to find a way of speeding up the process to ensure there is no controversy hanging over the outcome of the previous seasons championship. I think we should close this chapter now for 2021 but the FIA has to control the teams from the very beginning onwards from January onwards which is what I said already two years ago when we discussed this cost cap story said AlphaTauri team principal Franz Tost. Why Because the regulation is very very complicated and there is room for different interpretations and therefore the teams need some support and the FIA has to send people to the teams to check all this because its bad for the image of Formula 1 for the teams whatever if one year afterwards we discuss about overspending or whatever. This has to be done and sorted out during the season that at the end of the season everything is finalised and the technical regulations are also possible why shouldnt it be possible in the financial regulations. We have a meeting every Tuesday. I know every Tuesday how much we are below the cost cap and how we have to react and I think this should be the F1 standard that at the end of the season we know who won the championship and that this team was below the cost cap and everything has been sorted out.
PALMER: Could Mercedes have beaten Verstappen in Mexico City with bolder calls from the pit wall?, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.palmer-could-mercedes-have-beaten-a-flawless-verstappen-in-mexico-city.12yaYeWa0ZnfzQjzYLfZy6.html, Barely anybody has been able to beat Max and Red Bull on merit this season and it was the case again in Mexico on Sunday. Mercedes arrived in Mexico in buoyant mood. But Mexico City is a circuit where the polesitter has had an erratic time in the past so the thought of a Mercedes victory  or at least an entertaining fight for the win  seemed plausible on Saturday evening. It certainly would have made it a closer fight though had Hamilton been able to clear Perez quickly  no guarantee given Red Bulls topend speed advantage. Switching him to softs would likely have given Mercedes a double podium and by staying out there was the added benefit of pitting during a potential Safety Car., Max Verstappen has been nothing short of sensational this season and deservedly notched up his 14th win of the season ensuring his domination of 2022 will go down in the history books. Nobody has scored more wins in a single campaign in Formula 1. His dominance is underlined by the fact that there are still two races remaining to bolster that stat. Barely anybody has been able to beat Max and Red Bull on merit this season and it was the case again in Mexico on Sunday. But could Mercedes have won it Mercedes arrived in Mexico in buoyant mood. The thin air caused by the extreme altitude of Mexico City meant that their drag deficit which has been hampering their straightline speed this year was reduced. POWER RANKINGS Who tops the charts after the Mexico City Grand Prix Mercedes enjoyed the highaltitude Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez Verstappen produced a sublime lap in qualifying to clinch pole position doing what neither Mercedes driver could manage  putting three best sectors together on a single lap. Hamilton was compromised by abusing track limits on his first Q3 effort which naturally meant he had to be slightly more cautious on his second as he had no banker lap. Russell meanwhile was neckandneck with Verstappen heading into the final sector before sliding off wide at Turn 12 and aborting the lap. But Mexico City is a circuit where the polesitter has had an erratic time in the past so the thought of a Mercedes victory  or at least an entertaining fight for the win  seemed plausible on Saturday evening. No polesitter at the previous three Mexican Grands Prix had even managed to make the podium. READ MORE In hindsight its always easier  Wolff defends Mercedes Mexico strategy as wait for 2022 win goes on Inevitably that changed with the dominant Dutchman on pole commanding a lightstoflag victory as weve come to expect this year. What we didnt expect was Mercedes challenge wilting after they were talking up their chances prerace and have been so close to victory at other circuits where their pace seemed less competitive. This came down predominantly to their strategy and more specifically their use of the hard tyre in the Grand Prix. Jolyon Palmers Analysis Who made the right choices in Mexico City The hard tyre wasnt a good tyre as evidenced by Daniel Ricciardo who used the soft to charge his way past the midfielders who had opted for it earlier on. Ricciardo was even fast enough to overcome the deserved 10second penalty that he received for taking Tsunoda off at Turn 6 in his botched attempt. Given Ricciardo made effectively 20 seconds on Lando Norris  on the soft tyre versus the hard tyre in the second stint  its plausible that a similar choice for Mercedes could have given Hamilton a chance of fighting Verstappen given his 15second deficit in the end. The decision for Hamilton was a tough call for Mercedes who would have lost track position to Perez had they waited for the soft tyre rather than boxing for hards earlier on. It was an understandable choice and in all likelihood wouldnt have changed the outcome for their seventime champion. READ MORE The design secrets that set Red Bulls RB18 apart from its F1 rivals Hamilton unlike Norris was lapping in clear air and thus the comparison to Ricciardos pace is probably too generous. It certainly would have made it a closer fight though had Hamilton been able to clear Perez quickly  no guarantee given Red Bulls topend speed advantage. The call for Russell was the bigger error from Mercedes in my opinion. Russell matched the pace of Hamilton throughout the Mexican weekend and had nothing to lose by doing something different as he was already fourth in a fourcar race. Switching him to softs would likely have given Mercedes a double podium and by staying out there was the added benefit of pitting during a potential Safety Car. Mercedes could have had a double podium with a mediumsoft strategy George was calling for it from the cockpit as well but Mercedes were ultimately cautious with strategy in Mexico  and thats not how they will be able to challenge the mighty VerstappenRed Bull partnership in 2022. Credit should go to Verstappen for the way he absorbed the early pressure and then optimised his own strategy by ensuring he had plenty of life in the medium tyre. Mexico has always been a low energy track thats kind on tyres. Red Bull used that to their full advantage but it still takes the driver to do the job from the cockpit as well. Verstappen is looking the complete package right now and while his victory stats show the extent of his dominance this season they dont display the full array of his skillset that weve witnessed.

F1 set to abandon plan to lower tyre blanket temperatures for 2023, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/f1-set-to-abandon-plan-to-lower-tyre-blanket-temperatures-for-2023/10393961/, Listen to this articleThe move has long been planned as part of an additional change for 2024 where tyre blanket use is set to be totally abandoned within the championships sustainability drive. Because this is the period of blanket that is using a lot more energy  its like the oven at home he continued. And to propose a full 2023 strategy of tyre blanket heating two hours at 70C. Thats the plan for the moment.It is understood that Pirelli has also presented its 2023 tyre blanket idea to the FIA and the F1 organisation and has received positive feedback to the new approach rather than lowering the blanket temperature to 50C. Isola also suggested that the inevent tyre testing conducted in Austin and Mexico could return at certain events next year., Listen to this article The move has long been planned as part of an additional change for 2024 where tyre blanket use is set to be totally abandoned within the championships sustainability drive. But lowering tyre blanket temperature alone has proved to be unpopular with the drivers and has been in the headlines in particular since the recent US Grand Prix where the first of two inevent 2023 tyre tests took place before the second occurred in Mexico last weekend. Red Bulls world champion Max Verstappen said the move would lead to a lot of crashes while McLarens Lando Norris felt everyones going to shunt their car at some point. In response to the drivers comments after the Austin test Pirelli conducted an experiment for the Mexico test where the tyres were heated in blankets at 70C but only for two hours and not the usual three which would have remained the operation for the 50C limit being brought in. Pirelli apparently discovered that this change actually used less energy overall and would soothe the drivers concerns at the same time. Pirelli motorsport boss Mario Isola then explained to Motorsport.com that while for 2024 the plan is still not to have a blanket for next year the investigation of our analysis said that if you warm the tyres at 70C for two hours and not three hours you save more energy than the blankets at 50C for three hours. Because this is the period of blanket that is using a lot more energy  its like the oven at home he continued. So if you switch it on you have a first phase where you go up to the required temperature and then its stabilised. But to keep the temperature at the level you want you need to use energy. So thats the point. Tyre heating system Ferrari F175 Charles Leclerc Carlos Sainz Photo by Erik Junius Isola presented Pirellis findings to the drivers in their Mexico City GP postFP2 regular briefing. He said that the drivers agreed they would prefer F1 to adopt the approach of heating the tyres hotter for a shorter period. For me its a sensible solution said Isola. As I said we also save more energy. Now we have to analyse all the data from the heating approach ahead of the Mexico test because clearly the test was only last Friday and we didnt have a lot of time to analyse the data. The rest of the plan is to find the five compounds we want to homologate for 2023. Then bring the final version of the tyres to Abu Dhabi for the postseason test so the drivers can test the final range of compounds. And to propose a full 2023 strategy of tyre blanket heating two hours at 70C. Thats the plan for the moment. It is understood that Pirelli has also presented its 2023 tyre blanket idea to the FIA and the F1 organisation and has received positive feedback to the new approach rather than lowering the blanket temperature to 50C. Isola also suggested that the inevent tyre testing conducted in Austin and Mexico could return at certain events next year. These are useful only for Pirelli getting data on how the compounds it is producing are working rather than building the specific construction of the tyres  that requires longer private test events as cars need their setups adjusted to get the right data. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes W13 Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images What they call in competition test is an option for the future said Isola. Especially next year we have 24 races we have a second part of the season with a lot of overseas events. We know how much teams and team personnel are stressed because they have to travel a lot and so on. So if we have this option we dont oblige the teams to stay out for another 23 days for our tyre testing. And we can use this in a second part of the season. As the 2024 tyre blanket ban plan is remaining at this stage it would be logical to expect that either Pirelli would have to produce all new tyre constructions for that year or the teams would have to make substantial changes to their designs to improve earlystint tyre warm up. There were suggestions from some engineers that on this factor too the impact of the proposed reduction to 50C tyre blanket heating had only been fully revealed very late in the car design process for 2023 which also added to the opposition to that plan being utilised.
Alpine: Alonso F1 engine failures are "luck of the draw", https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/alpine-alonso-f1-engine-failures-are-luck-of-the-draw/10394180/, After the race Alonso reflected on how many engine problems he has had in 2022 and how they always seemed to happen to his car. So again this was an engine issue said Szafnauer when asked why there was a pattern. And we dont have the same people preparing an Esteban engine or a Fernando engine they all mix around. Esteban in the latter half of the race started losing water pressure so we had to lift and coast it he explained. But we dont know the root cause., Listen to this article The Spaniard was forced to retire from last weekends race on the 64th lap with a cylinder issue while running in seventh place. The retirement cost Alpine priceless points in its battle with McLaren for fourth in the F1 world championship. After the race Alonso reflected on how many engine problems he has had in 2022 and how they always seemed to happen to his car. So again this was an engine issue said Szafnauer when asked why there was a pattern. And we dont have the same people preparing an Esteban engine or a Fernando engine they all mix around. The probability of this happening isnt zero. So it can happen. But it is lower to always to have it on one side or the other. But when I was at Honda I cant remember how many engine failures Takuma Sato had like 13 in a year and Jenson Button had none. Zero. And the question always came up we couldnt find anything to show that it was one side or the other. And at that point the questions were always does Takuma drive it so much differently to Jenson that it always happens on his side I think it was just the luck of the draw. So I think its the luck of the draw this time. Pressed on whether or not there was a reason he said Not that we can find. So its not that we can see that Its this set of circumstances its always on Fernandos side. An exasperated Fernando Alonso Alpine F1 Team after retiring from the race Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images Szafnauer admitted that he understood that Alonso might be upset Look we apologise to Fernando. You always feel frustrated when youre managing a race forward backward. I mean there was no risk whatsoever. And you know the points are in the bag no ones pushing you. And that makes it even more frustrating. So I get it. The race initially went to plan for Alpine with Alonso and teammate Esteban Ocon crucially ahead of the McLarens of Lando Norris and Daniel Ricciardo. Alonso also gained a place from Valtteri Bottas with Ocon jumping the Finn later on. Once we were ahead of them it was just about managing said Szafnauer. Fernando for example was driving at about a second a lap slower than he could have. And just managing temperatures brakes. We knew it was going to be tough to get it to the end. And Esteban on the other hand did a really good job to get ahead of the McLarens. We initially set out to go on to the hard. But then we did see that the soft was possible too we watched some others. We didnt react too quickly. And Lewiss lap time was really good on the hard. So we kept with our strategy which would have worked well to the end. But Fernando had his cylinder issue which meant he had to stop. We tried to get him to limp home but eventually he couldnt. He had that issue for about 13 to 14 laps before we stopped him. The good news for Alonso is that he should have enough power unit elements in his pool to make it through the last two races without penalty This engine was never going to run again anyway. However the root cause we dont know yet. It could have been a sparkplug could have been a piston ring could have been excessive knock. Szafnauer also revealed Ocon didnt have a straightforward race to his eighth place either. Esteban in the latter half of the race started losing water pressure so we had to lift and coast it he explained. We dont know what it is yet. But it looked like it was a small water leak in the water system somewhere which is why you start losing pressure. And the best way is to stabilise it. If you can imagine if youre boiling water the pressure will raise in whatever vessel its in and you bring it down you cool it down less pressure less leak. So it didnt cause any damage. But we dont know the root cause.
Mercedes junior gets first F1 test - but is he another Russell?, https://the-race.com/formula-1/mercedes-junior-gets-first-f1-test-but-is-he-another-russell/, Mercedes junior Frederik Vesti will pilot one of the teams Formula 1 cars in the postseason Abu Dhabi Grand Prix test but can he follow in the footsteps of George Russell and progress to F1 Danish driver Vesti will get his first taste of F1 machinery in the Yas Marina test at which current Mercedes reserve Nyck de Vries is set to make an early debut for his 2023 employer AlphaTauri. Theres little immediate competition within the top ranks of the Mercedes junior programme  although 16yearold Andrea Kimi Antonelli might just be the next big thing  so Vesti was the obvious choice for the young driver test with De Vries leaving for AlphaTauri. Its still a small vindication for the hard work hes put in behind the scenes on Mercedes simulator this year. Clearly Mercedes has little room within its own F1 team with Russell thriving since he joined at the start of the year and Hamilton likely to extend his current deal beyond 2023., Mercedes junior Frederik Vesti will pilot one of the teams Formula 1 cars in the postseason Abu Dhabi Grand Prix test but can he follow in the footsteps of George Russell and progress to F1 Danish driver Vesti will get his first taste of F1 machinery in the Yas Marina test at which current Mercedes reserve Nyck de Vries is set to make an early debut for his 2023 employer AlphaTauri. De Vries was on AlphaTauris radar earlier than you might think Read more Vesti joined the Mercedes junior programme off the back of his rookie FIA Formula 3 campaign in 2020 where overall he fell short of his more experienced Prema teammates Oscar Piastri and Logan Sargeant who are both headed for F1 in 2023 with McLaren and Williams respectively although Sargeants deal is yet to be confirmed and he requires super licence points. Although he couldnt join them in the title fight and was generally thirdbest among them he did match and outshine them on occasion. He remained in F3 for 2021 and switched to another junior singleseater behemoth ART Grand Prix but a title challenge failed to materialise and he finished fourth for the second consecutive season with a single victory. Vesti then stepped up to Formula 2 with ART racing alongside Sauber protege Theo Pourchaire who along with Piastri and Sargeant had beaten Vesti in F3 in 2020. Pourchaire leads that intrateam fight as he runs second in the drivers championship heading into the Abu Dhabi finale while Vesti is eighth but only nine points adrift from fourth place. Following a tricky start where he was pointless in the opening five races Vesti looked seriously quick in the middle of the season. He picked up his maiden F2 win in Baku qualified on the front row at Silverstone and then was on pole at the Red Bull Ring. That Austrian GP feature race was a disaster as a tardy start was followed by penalties for leaving the track and gaining an advantage and track limits violations that left Vesti emptyhanded from a weekend where he looked so strong. More pointless weekends would come later in the year at Spa and Zandvoort but this was followed by an excellent brace of second place finishes at Monza such has been the rollercoaster nature of Vestis season. Consistency over a season has been lacking for Vesti since he won the Formula Regional European Championship in 2019 in a field that rarely exceeded 11 cars. Its hardly been as convincing a rise up F1s ladder as the likes of Russell who won GP3 now F3 and F2 in backtoback years but not every future F1 driver has to boast that kind of record. This years F2 season has been one of the most bizarre inconsistent and hard to read in the championships history. Vesti has by no means stood head and shoulders among that field this year but equally hes not been far off star rookie Sargeant and Jack Doohan both of whom were right among F1s 2023 silly season. Vesti will likely reunite with Prema  responsible for four of the last seven F2GP2 champions  for a second year of F2 in 2023 so he should have the right tools to deliver a potential title challenge. Theres little immediate competition within the top ranks of the Mercedes junior programme  although 16yearold Andrea Kimi Antonelli might just be the next big thing  so Vesti was the obvious choice for the young driver test with De Vries leaving for AlphaTauri. Its still a small vindication for the hard work hes put in behind the scenes on Mercedes simulator this year. Clearly Mercedes has little room within its own F1 team with Russell thriving since he joined at the start of the year and Hamilton likely to extend his current deal beyond 2023. But Vesti can still put himself in the conversation for a 2024 F1 seat somewhere on the grid if he can excel in F2 next year against some stiff competition including likely returnees Doohan Pourchaire and Dennis Hauger as well as his probable new Prema teammate highlyrated Ferrari junior Ollie Bearman. Comparisons to Russell are optimistic at this stage of Vestis career hes shown flashes of real speed but hes yet to string it together in a convincing enough fashion to demand promotion to F1 in the same way Russells results and work with Mercedes did throughout 2017 and 2018. Its down to Vesti to change that in Abu Dhabi and in 2023.
Formula 1's Las Vegas Grand Prix Is Going to Cost More Than Monaco, https://jalopnik.com/formula-1s-las-vegas-grand-prix-is-going-to-cost-more-t-1849730690, Formula 1s upcoming 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix is one of the more hyped events to join the series calendar and now it looks like prices are going to reflect that hype. That officially makes this race more expensive than the Monaco Grand Prix  and thats also not taking into account the massive number of lush packages that are said to be available to VIPs. If you want a little perspective grandstand tickets for a full weekend at the 2023 Monaco Grand Prix will run at maximum 410.59 using prices from Goo Tickets. The most expensive threeday grandstand ticket available via Grand Prix Tickets is just about 1500. It seems like the Las Vegas Grand Prix is catering to a bigticket buyer and the rest of us will be left in the dust., Formula 1s upcoming 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix is one of the more hyped events to join the series calendar and now it looks like prices are going to reflect that hype. According to presale information via the tracks website youre going to be paying 500 for General Admission alone  or 2000 if you want a guaranteed seat. That officially makes this race more expensive than the Monaco Grand Prix  and thats also not taking into account the massive number of lush packages that are said to be available to VIPs. If you want a little perspective grandstand tickets for a full weekend at the 2023 Monaco Grand Prix will run at maximum 410.59 using prices from Goo Tickets. The most expensive threeday grandstand ticket available via Grand Prix Tickets is just about 1500. Im going to be honest If I paid 500 to literally stand around in one small flat area of Las Vegas in the hopes of seeing a race car on a street circuit and could get my hands on no beverage more powerful than a 0 Heineken Id snap. That right there would be my Joaquin Phoenix Joker moment. Advertisement If you were looking for a grandstand ticket you can expect to pay somewhere between 2000 and 2500  though it currently isnt clear if those are static ticket prices or if those are just the starting price for certain grandstands. For example at Circuit of the Americas certain rows of a grandstand may cost more than a different row of the same grandstand due to the view. Youll have to inquire about hospitality as well but Skybox shared hospitality is priced at 10000 for four days. I also want to note that these are presale prices listed via Ticketmaster knowing how Ticketmaster sales usually go theres a good chance scalpers are going to make a pretty penny on resales for the folks who didnt nab tickets right away. GO Media may get a commission 400 off Anker 767 PowerHouse Powered by GaNPrime Anker is launching a new power station in its lineupthe Anker 767 PowerHouse. It delivers a massive amount of power at 2400W and has a suitcase design for easy portability. Buy for 400 off at Anker Advertisement The thing that I find most fascinating is that these tickets are grouped together by small region and you only have access to that region. If you have tickets for hospitality in the South Koval Zone for example you cant go pop over to General Admission and see how things are going. You cant meet up with a friend behind the West Harmon Zone grandstands. I understand that temporary street circuits are inherently limited but Ive never seen such a cordoning off of track regions. Of course my experience largely comes from IndyCar where street circuits like Long Beach Detroit Toronto and St. Pete generally confine viewers to certain areas  but you can still wander around all those areas. In Miami for Formula 1 it was the same story there were a lot of places you couldnt go but any area open to one fan was open to all fans. Ive been looking forward to covering the event as media but it also makes me wonder how much Id actually get to see in order to report on the track ambiance. Advertisement Its going to be interesting to see how the limited fan experience plays out  though Im not sure many of the folks buying tickets are going to be the Average Joe who adores F1. It seems like the Las Vegas Grand Prix is catering to a bigticket buyer and the rest of us will be left in the dust.

Ferrari’s rivals don’t think Mexico slump was true reflection of F1 form, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/ferrari-rivals-mexico-slump-form/10393998/, That left the door open for Mercedes to emerge as Red Bulls main challenger for the victory. However few believe that the Mexico showing was realistic of where Ferrari stacks up right now.

I think Ferrari looked like they were a little bit handicapped this weekend so Im not sure we saw their real pace. Im pretty sure if Im listening at the drivers later on in the debriefing they will tell me that the car was not turning., Listen to this article Ferrari endured one of its most challenging outings of the season in Mexico last weekend as it could not extract its regular pace from the F175. That left the door open for Mercedes to emerge as Red Bulls main challenger for the victory. In the end Carlos Sainz was the lead Ferrari to come home in fifth place but he finished more than 58 seconds behind race winner Max Verstappen. With Mercedes having enjoyed an uplift in form over recent races Ferraris performances have prompted suggestions that Red Bulls main threat is now the German car manufacturer rather than the Italian squad. However few believe that the Mexico showing was realistic of where Ferrari stacks up right now. Asked if Red Bull regarded Mercedes as its strongest competitor in F1 team boss Christian Horner said I think this track has played to their strengths. I think Ferrari looked like they were a little bit handicapped this weekend so Im not sure we saw their real pace. Im sure theyll be back. Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff reckons that while things have gone better for his squad in recent outings a much better picture would emerge from the Brazilian GP. Pushed on if he felt Mercedes was ahead of Ferrari Wolff said I wouldnt want to say that because they are a strong team and weve had a few strong Sundays now. But maybe this circuit flattered us. I think after Brazil well have maybe more of a picture but I dont think theyre suddenly half a minute slower than us. George Russell Mercedes W13 Carlos Sainz Ferrari F175 Charles Leclerc Ferrari F175 Photo by Sam Bloxham  Motorsport Images Ferrari is hopeful that the scale of its deficit in Mexico was a oneoff caused by altitude which meant its power unit could not perform as well as it does nearer sealevel. However team principal Mattia Binotto said that a lack of power did not offer a full explanation for why it was so far adrift of Red Bull and Mercedes. I think the compromise both of them drivers are mentioning certainly is in terms of power unit we were not at our best performance for the weekend he said. But I dont think that thats explaining the most. Thats part of the equation but there is certainly more than that and its something which we need to look at. There is not a clear answer right now. The ride was not great. The balance was not great. Im pretty sure if Im listening at the drivers later on in the debriefing they will tell me that the car was not turning. The reason why I think it has to be looked at and we have not a clear explanation right now. Additional reporting by Filip Cleeren
Mauro Forghieri obituary: Legendary Ferrari F1 designer dies at 87, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/legendary-ferrari-f1-designer-mauro-forghieri-dies-at-87/10394065/, Enzo Ferrari and Mauro Forghieri Photo by David PhippsDuring his tenure he was instrumental in creating some of the squads most successful and famous F1 designs. Other drivers he helped win the championships with at Ferrari included Niki Lauda and Jody Scheckter. When that project was completed he left Ferrari for good in 1987. Following his long career at Ferrari Forghieri moved to Lamborghini where he worked on its V12 engine that raced in F1 in 1989 and 1990. Otherwise in my eyes he is not a world champion.As the result of his historical contribution to Ferrari Forghieri received honorary citizenship of Modena last January., During a lengthy career as the technical chief at Ferrari from 1962 to 1984 he helped guide Ferrari to four drivers titles seven constructors crowns and 54 grand prix victories. He originally joined Ferrari as an apprentice in 1960 having graduated from the University of Bologna with a mechanical engineering degree. Having made a good early impression following the departure of then chief designer Carlo Chiti in 1961 he was asked by team founder Enzo Ferrari to step up to head the technical side of the team. Enzo Ferrari and Mauro Forghieri Photo by David Phipps During his tenure he was instrumental in creating some of the squads most successful and famous F1 designs. This included the V8powered 158 that John Surtees won the world title with in 1964 as well as the 312 series of both grand prix and sportscar fame. Other drivers he helped win the championships with at Ferrari included Niki Lauda and Jody Scheckter. Forghieri finally left his position as technical director in 1984 and switched to a new role working on the Ferrari 408 4RM concept car. When that project was completed he left Ferrari for good in 1987. Following his long career at Ferrari Forghieri moved to Lamborghini where he worked on its V12 engine that raced in F1 in 1989 and 1990. He was also briefly involved in the ultimately stalled efforts for a new Lamborghinibacked GLAS F1 team which then became the Modena squad in 1991. When Lamborghinis engineering department was reorganised at the end of 1991 and the Modena team ran out of funding Forghieri left and helped set up the mechanical design Oral Engineering Group whose clients included BMW Bugatti and Aprilia. He was still involved with the project until recently. Mauro Forghieri consults Niki Lauda Photo by David Phipps The Italian kept a close eye on F1 and several years ago famously made it clear how he did not like the current rules that allowed for DRS. I dislike the whole aerodynamics of the current cars he said. I dont understand why it is not reduced in order to allow normal overtaking without DRS. Now if ones opponent is less than a second behind he can only watch as his pursuer goes past  and that cannot be correct. A world champion needs to be in a position to overtake his opponent without help. Otherwise in my eyes he is not a world champion.

The underrated Verstappen trait behind his new F1 record, https://the-race.com/formula-1/the-underrated-verstappen-trait-behind-his-new-f1-record/, And it is no coincidence that the same drivers tend to excel in this area  with Verstappen certainly among them. Verstappens tyre management has won him races before this. His first victory in Spain in 2016 on his Red Bull debut is a favoured example. While the softmedium strategy didnt seem to be seriously on many peoples radar Red Bull was confident it was possible because it had two drivers capable of making it work. Even when Verstappen looked occasionally vulnerable to Hamiltons chasing Mercedes he always managed to keep it at arms length., Max Verstappens recordbreaking 14th victory in the 2022 Formula 1 season came down to something that he talked about after his ninth. Its not only today I think Im always good on tyres Verstappen said at the Belgian Grand Prix when asked about how well he had managed his Pirellis in an extended opening stint on softs. Maybe people dont look at it. Just as that win at Spa required a gentle touch to manage the softs and make a onestop strategy work effectively so too did his Mexican Grand Prix win last weekend. The implication with Verstappens answer at Spa obviously was that when the likes of Sergio Perez and Lewis Hamilton get hailed as tyre whisperers Verstappens own skill in this regard is underrated. He was right though. Verstappens headline qualities are his speed and his aggression. But he is a much more refined driver than that. Tyre management is one of F1s unsexy skills and can sometimes be dismissed as a particularly negative aspect of modern F1  as if it was never a factor in years gone by. It is a crucial skill. And it is no coincidence that the same drivers tend to excel in this area  with Verstappen certainly among them. Verstappens tyre management has won him races before this. His first victory in Spain in 2016 on his Red Bull debut is a favoured example. In Austria in 2018 he drove cleverly by lifting slightly through the highspeed corners to put a little less energy into them and avoid the blistering issues that struck thenteammate Ricciardo and Hamilton. That year he also obliterated Ricciardo in Mexico where he has now won four times pulling a full pitstop on him despite managing his laptimes and his tyres after grabbing the lead at the start. This year has provided different case studies. If there is a specific modern F1 demand it is that the working range of the Pirellis requires the tyre to be brought in carefully or they will not last as long as they should. Those who truly get on top of this have a wonderful sensitivity. They feel the tyre underneath them and usually know how hard they can push without taking it too far. At the same time if they do wander into some tyre strife they can get it back under control. For instance this helped Verstappen win the United States Grand Prix where after losing time in his pitstop he had to work the tyres harder than hed have liked running in the dirty air of the Ferrari of Charles Leclerc and then passing it. By his own admission I damaged my tyres a little bit too much in the beginning of that new tyre set and that meant Verstappen had to be restrained in his chase of Hamilton to recover the tyres. Which he did and then he pushed and then caught Hamilton and then he passed him to win. Verstappen has more patience in certain scenarios than he is given credit for aided by the growing confidence hes had that the car will have enough pace once the tyres are where they need to be. This was the case in Mexico a race that demands a lot of discipline. While the softmedium strategy didnt seem to be seriously on many peoples radar Red Bull was confident it was possible because it had two drivers capable of making it work. Even when Verstappen looked occasionally vulnerable to Hamiltons chasing Mercedes he always managed to keep it at arms length. I never really felt like I was under pressure I was just managing my tyres to get through that number of laps he said. The key Mercedes mistakes that surprised Red Bull in Mexico Read more Once Verstappen got a good idea of what the softs could handle he pushed to build his lead to over two seconds and that gave him a buffer as the tyres started to fall away right at the end of the stint. But he had done enough to make the long run on mediums realistic. It was still a question mark Verstappen said but within a few laps he had the feeling he needed to get to the end. Which he did. It was an achievement against Mercedes initial expectations but in keeping with Verstappens proficiency at not abusing the tyre and therefore another example of what Red Bull team boss Christian Horner believes Verstappen has been masterful at this year. When you see how hes playing with the tools that he has available to him within the car hes constantly on top of them said Horner. You hear the banter between him and his engineer and hes got a tremendous feel for what the tyres need and what they dont need and its something hes developed. Hes always been strong at it but I think this year hes been exceptional.

The 2022 Championship has not been the season Ricciardo had hoped for with the Aussie struggling to break into the top ten.

Thats where I dont know I dont know how Im continuing to continue because to say its painful is an understatement. He vowed to spring back and spring back he did putting in his best drive of the championship in Mexico where he came from 12.5s behind Esteban Ocon to overtake several cars before taking P7 off him. He then put 12 seconds between himself and the Alpine driver to negate the 10second time penalty hed received for hitting Yuki Tsunoda. He was voted Driver of the Day a muchwelcomed plaudit for the beleaguered driver. Im happy for him that after these tough years hes had a little sense of achievement again F1Insider quotes the former F1 driver Hulkenberg as having told ServusTV. This Nothing just Danny Ric doing a finger gun before an overtake MexicoGP F1pic.twitter.comJXWlJoSYnh  PlanetF1 PlanetF1 October 31 2022 McLaren team boss Andreas Seidl also applauded Ricciardos performance in Mexico acknowledging it would be a welcome boost for the driver. Daniel then really flew and showed great overtaking manoeuvres he said. Im even happier for him because he can now go into these last two races with selfconfidence. With his McLaren career over Ricciardo is now looking ahead to a year on the sidelines with the 33yearold taking the time to recharge before potentially returning in 2024. Turning down the chance of a Haas seat he said Its now just trying to set myself up for success Id call it in the long term. Hulkenberg reckons its a welcome break for the eighttime grand prix winner. I think after the two turbulent years hes glad that hes going to be out for a year and can sort himself out he said. Knowing him and seeing his body language I think he needs to get off this Formula 1 rat race. But while Ricciardo is leaving the rat race there are suggestions Hulkenberg will be back in it next season. The German is being tipped to replace Mick Schumacher at Haas next season after Aston Martin announced Stoffel Vandoorne as their reserve driver.

More info Formula One CEO Stefano Domenicali may end up angering Christian Horner and Toto Wolff after he travelled to Colombia to discuss adding a race there to the sports schedule. The two great rivals have both previously spoken out about the length of the F1 calendar and may worry about the impact of another South American race on their Red Bull and Mercedes colleagues. In 2023 Formula One will have more races than ever before with 24 events scheduled to be on the calendar. However it looks like it could grow even further with Domenicali entering negotiations with Colombia about a future Grand Prix while a return to South Africa has also been widely mooted. Under the terms of the Concorde Agreement signed in 2020 no more than 25 races can take place within a season meaning current events would have to drop off if Colombia and South Africa were to join with Belgium among the most likely. Yet this may not be enough to pacify Wolff and Horner after the team bosses were unhappy with the expanded calendar for next year. The Austrian argued the change was unsustainable and he claimed that he would no longer travel to all races as a result.

Ferrari's Shwartzman 'very sad' at fading Formula 1 dream, https://www.motorsportweek.com/2022/11/02/ferraris-shwartzman-very-sad-at-fading-formula-1-dream/, Ferrari test driver Robert Shwartzman has conceded that his Formula 1 race ambitions are likely over after missing out on a seat for another season. What will happen in the future I dont know yet but its super hard and challenging to get into Formula 1. I dont really understand it the lineup and the driver decisions teams do I dont get it from my side. If you dont race you miss that spirit of being a race driver to fight to win and push yourself. Imagine if I dont race I will wait wait wait and if I have the opportunity I would not be ready for it as I had not raced since 2021., Ferrari test driver Robert Shwartzman has conceded that his Formula 1 race ambitions are likely over after missing out on a seat for another season. Shwartzman was among Ferraris leading junior prospects claiming the 2019 FIA Formula 3 title and finished fourth in his rookie Formula 2 campaign before placing runnerup to teammate Oscar Piastri in 2021. Of the 2020 crop champion Mick Schumacher Yuki Tsunoda and Nikita Mazepin stepped up to Formula 1 while from the 2021 group Zhou Guanyu debuted this year and champion Piastri will belatedly graduate with McLaren in 2023. Shwartzman instead took up a role with Ferrari as its official test driver and was tasked with undertaking extensive simulator duties. He was nominated as its young driver participating in FP1 in Austin and will partake in the corresponding session in Abu Dhabi. Offtrack Shwartzman also switched his racing license to Israel the country of his birth and has spent much of the year in Italy to where he moved as a child. Honestly it was a tough year Shwartzman tells MotorsportWeek.com. Unfortunately I didnt race which for any racing driver is a big thing. What will happen in the future I dont know yet but its super hard and challenging to get into Formula 1. I always pushed and worked really hard it didnt matter what was going around with the dream or target to get to Formula 1. Will it happen or not happen At this stage I dont know. I can guess maybe not. And thats obviously very sad for me because it has been such a big work and I kept on pushing and believing and at the end still it doesnt happen for various reasons. Shwartzman accepts that the thing I could have done a bit better is bring the results those years in 2020 and 2021 and that would probably give me a bigger help to get into F1 but stresses theres still no guarantee Id be there. There is also an aspect of disillusionment with the structure of the driver market. I mean F1 is a bit weird to be honest these days for me at least he says. I dont really understand it the lineup and the driver decisions teams do I dont get it from my side. I dont want to put names but for me unfortunately it doesnt always go by the merit. Oscar had to wait a year and it was a bit messy for him. I put myself in it as well I pushed him hard did hard work and I know if I would have a chance Id show Im capable. It is what it is at this stage its the situation where I cant do anything about it even though Id love to and make it more fair. Robert Shwartzman RUS  ISR Ferrari Developement Driver. United States Grand Prix Friday 21st October 2022. Circuit of the Americas Austin Texas USA. When pressed on why he feels that way Shwartzman replies Well I cant go up to a team and say take me because I really deserve it and would bring the results I cant do that because I can say it prove it and show it on eventual results but the decisionmaking thing is not going to be on me. So looking at how it is now its maybe not the main priority for them. The status of 2019 F2 champion Nyck de Vries is raised with the Dutchman sealing a 2023 AlphaTauri seat hugely facilitated by his substitute appearance with Williams at Monza. But Shwartzman isnt keen on such a strategy and wants to get back behind the wheel somewhere in 2023. Honestly for Nyck it happened after three years he raced and honestly I respect Nyck and think hes talented and good but the stars aligned perfectly for him and he did a good job of taking that opportunity  he got one shot and he took it Shwartzman explains. Will I Who knows. To wait and sit here and waste time not racing just hoping for a miracle to happen I would not really see it quite logical for me and anyway after doing this work I really want to race next year as I miss racing. If you dont race you miss that spirit of being a race driver to fight to win and push yourself. Imagine if I dont race I will wait wait wait and if I have the opportunity I would not be ready for it as I had not raced since 2021. So for me the main priority next year is to go race. Where I dont know we are looking at options and what we have on the table for the best offer possible and well see. Shwartzman is nonetheless hopeful that the recent setbacks will stand him in stronger stead for 2023 and beyond. Theres positives to take as I matured more I learned more I know how to handle myself better with the engineers how to work with them better so anyway for my career  it doesnt matter where I will be  it was an important phase in my life he reflects. We did a few tests with the old car I did the FP1 first time in Austin the first time in the car so it was very interesting and very cool. Well have another one in Abu Dhabi thats it not much driving unfortunately but it is what it is.
Tickets to the F1 Las Vegas GP Go on Sale Starting at $500, https://www.thedrive.com/news/tickets-to-the-las-vegas-gp-go-on-sale-starting-at-500, Tickets have gone on sale for the firstever Las Vegas Grand Prix and as with everything in Formula 1 theyre rather expensive. Liberty Media is investing big in the Las Vegas Grand Prix as part of its broader push into the US market. The Las Vegas race will be the penultimate championship round in 2023 taking place on November 18 just prior to the season finale at Abu Dhabi. Pedants will note that while this the first inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix its not the first Grand Prix to take place in Las Vegas. Steep ticket prices arent particularly surprising then let alone in Las Vegas., Tickets have gone on sale for the firstever Las Vegas Grand Prix and as with everything in Formula 1 theyre rather expensive. The official ticketing website began presales to American Express Early Access customers on Tuesday. In the Phase 1 offering a basic general admission ticket will set you back 500 for a threeday pass. This is for the standingroom only section at the MSG Sphere and includes a food and nonalcoholic drinks package. Its unclear whether these are the promised affordable tickets that would be made available but The Drive has requested clarification and will update this article accordingly. Those wanting a seat in the MSG Sphere grandstand section will have to cough up 2000 for the privilege. The MSG Sphere zone covers from Turn 5 through to Turn 9 including the lowspeed switchback of Turn 7 and Turn 8. The coveted startfinish straight is covered by the East Harmon zone. A seat in the grandstand there comes at a higher cost of 2500. Beyond that are the Skybox tickets for those with the deepest pockets. Unlike the lower tier tickets these cover four days of action across the weekend. They also cost 10000 apiece. At this stage tickets are still in the presale phase. Sales will open to those who registered for the Priority Interest List on November 3 before going on sale to the general public on November 5. All tickets will be sold as minimum threeday passes so dont expect to save money by only showing up for the race. There is also a limit of eight tickets per customer via the official ticketing outlet. Liberty Media is investing big in the Las Vegas Grand Prix as part of its broader push into the US market. The 2023 calendar will feature three races stateside with the new event joining the existing Miami and Austin races on the calendar. The Las Vegas race will be the penultimate championship round in 2023 taking place on November 18 just prior to the season finale at Abu Dhabi. Pedants will note that while this the first inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix its not the first Grand Prix to take place in Las Vegas. That honor goes to the oftridiculed Caesars Palace Grand Prix run in 1981 and 1982. Taking place on a track literally built in a casino car park the circuit was unpopular with drivers and attracted few fans. Originally a Formula 1 World Championship event it was retooled into a CART race for 1983 and 1984 before being abandoned altogether. Formula 1 has never been a budget sport for the fans or the drivers. Steep ticket prices arent particularly surprising then let alone in Las Vegas. Still if youre looking to get involved 500 for a threeday pass isnt too bad especially given the food and drinks are on the house.

Norris started the race in eighth but lost out to both Alpines of Fernando Alonso and Esteban Ocon on the first lap dropping down to 10th. He maintained that position before switching from the mediums to the hard tyre as he attempted to avoid the undercut from AlphaTauris Yuki Tsunoda  who changed from the softs to the mediums. Norris was then able to make his way past Valtteri Bottas for tenth towards the end of the race. Alonsos retirement saw him gain a place to ninth after he also let team mate Daniel Ricciardo  on the soft tyre  through to finish seventh ahead of Ocon.

That opened up the chance for Daniel to go very long and on to the softs which gave him the opportunity to finish seventh and score some valuable points for us. I think we did a good job did what we had to do at certain points but we still looked at the big picture and the other side did a very good job today. Im happy.

Norris: Mexico F1 strategy "a mistake" relative to McLaren teammate Ricciardo, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/norris-mexico-strategy-mistake-ricciardo/10393568/, In contrast Norris who stopped earlier joined several others in going from the medium to the hard only to find it was lacking performance. He finished ninth some 16.5 seconds behind Ricciardo on the road having been three places ahead of him early on. Just one off the line and then one around the first few corners which is just a bit unlucky sometimes. He added We covered Yuki Tsunoda very early on which meant I had to go onto the hard tyre. I wouldnt say Brazil is going to suit us at all with our balance of the car and so on and our struggles., Listen to this article Ricciardo went from medium to soft tyres and had sufficient pace to not only charge up to seventh place but also negate a 10second penalty for contact with Yuki Tsunoda. In contrast Norris who stopped earlier joined several others in going from the medium to the hard only to find it was lacking performance. He finished ninth some 16.5 seconds behind Ricciardo on the road having been three places ahead of him early on. The Englishmans race had already been compromised by a difficult first lap in which he was passed by Fernando Alonso and Esteban Ocon of Alpine the team that McLaren is battling for fourth position in the world championship. I lost just two places in the beginning obviously both to Alpines which is the main thing he explained when asked by Motorsport.com about his start. Just one off the line and then one around the first few corners which is just a bit unlucky sometimes. So nothing too bad just the way it is. The rest I think we did a reasonable job. Norris made it clear that he did not get to run the strategy that he had hoped to use estimating that Ricciardos strategy was worth over 30 seconds over his own. He added We covered Yuki Tsunoda very early on which meant I had to go onto the hard tyre. So I would not really what I wanted to do. So maybe a bit of a mistake there to do that. But Daniel did what I wanted to do which was to stay out and then go onto the soft which was like 3040 seconds quicker in terms of race time. I think we did the best we could. Still managed to get past Bottas bought us with a few laps to go. So that one extra point always helps. Regarding the general lack of grip he said I mean thats just what we have to deal with. Yeah we made a mistake going onto the hard tyre. You dont have to use it we chose to. Thats life. Esteban Ocon Alpine A522 Lando Norris McLaren MCL36 Yuki Tsunoda AlphaTauri AT03 Photo by Sam Bloxham  Motorsport Images Norris is unsure about the teams potential form in Brazil as the battle with Alpine over fourth in the constructors title continues. The Enstone outfit currently leads by just seven points with two races remaining on the calendar and Norris was not especially buoyant about McLarens chances in Brazil. It makes me happy that were closing the gap he said. But were working hard. So I feel like we deserve to be getting what were getting at the end of the day. But it means we still have to work extremely hard to beat them over the next two races. I dont know how were going to do to be honest with you. I wouldnt say Brazil is going to suit us at all with our balance of the car and so on and our struggles. But I think even the last few races weve not been the quickest car or quick enough weve just done a better job with the strategy and with reliability such as today. So lets get to the chequered flag.

Delusional Horner is tarnishing the whole sport of Formula One, https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/delusional-horner-is-tarnishing-the-whole-sport-of-formula-one-d59jpvs3n, Lewis Hamilton was robbed. Even the FIA the governing body admits that it was a significant error from the race director. So permit me to say it again Hamilton was robbed. If the rules had been correctly applied he would now have an eighth world title. Horner may now be pondering whether, Lewis Hamilton was robbed. I think we should make that plain at the start of this column. I emphasise this because Christian Horner and Max Verstappen of Red Bull decided to boycott Sky Sports after one of its reporters used this word in relation to the finale of the 2021 season after a controversial safety car restart in the last moments of the race. Even the FIA the governing body admits that it was a significant error from the race director. So permit me to say it again Hamilton was robbed. If the rules had been correctly applied he would now have an eighth world title. If the race director had done his job Mercedes would boast another champion. Horner may now be pondering whether

I think we did a really good job. Most of the cars we overtook on track or we did it in the pitstops and we got to 12th. This year its a bit 5050 sometimes we get the qualifying right sometimes we get the race right., Alex Albon believes he and Williams executed a very good race at the Mexico City Grand Prix after narrowly missing out on a points finish with an encouraging rise from 19th at the end of the first lap to 12th at the chequered flag. Albon who scored in Australia Miami and Belgium earlier this season was just a few seconds shy of repeating the feat at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez as his Mercedespowered FW44 again displayed stronger pace in racetrim which helped the ThaiBritish driver to recover from a compromised start that cost him two places from 17th on the grid.

Most of the cars we overtook on track or we did it in the pitstops and we got to 12th. I felt like we did a very good job says Albon after climbing from P19 to 12th at the flag Considering where we were during practice on Friday on a circuit we knew was going to be difficult for us I felt like we did a very good job. Albon was then asked about Williams generally performing better on race days this season which prompted him to highlight how much progress the team have made in understanding their package  and how this should reap rewards in 2023. FACTS AND STATS Verstappen sets new season records for points and wins I think last year the team was maybe a little bit stronger in qualifying than the race. This year its a bit 5050 sometimes we get the qualifying right sometimes we get the race right. It is a bit of a moving board he commented. I think if you look at where we were at the start of the year and where we are now we generally really understand the cars weaknesses we get on top of them and we maximise the weekends. It puts us in a good place for development for next year because we understand the areas we need to work on. A very lonely and useless afternoon  Latifi reveals he was racing with a damaged car
Verstappen "incredibly proud" of F1 season wins record, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/verstappen-proud-f1-season-win-record/10393574/, It meant Verstappen surpassed the existing record jointly held by Michael Schumacher from 2004 and Sebastian Vettel from 2013 as well as claiming the record for the number of points scored in a single season with two races still remaining. Its just an incredible season for us as a team said Verstappen. But yeah of course Im incredibly proud.The season win record has been within Verstappens sightlines for some time but the Dutchman regularly downplayed the importance of the record and the possibility of getting there. Upon matching the record at the United States Grand Prix Verstappen noted the difference in eras and how F1 seasons now have more races. Schumachers 13race haul came in an 18race season while Vettel matched that number over 19 races in 2013., Listen to this article Having clinched his second F1 world title at Suzuka earlier this month Verstappen continued his dominant campaign by scoring his 14th win of the year in Sundays Mexican Grand Prix. It meant Verstappen surpassed the existing record jointly held by Michael Schumacher from 2004 and Sebastian Vettel from 2013 as well as claiming the record for the number of points scored in a single season with two races still remaining. Following his victory at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez Verstappen paid tribute to his Red Bull team for another great race after picking up its 16th win of the year and ninth in a row. Its just an incredible season for us as a team said Verstappen. I never thought I would be able to win 14 races in a year. But yeah of course Im incredibly proud.

Michael Schumacher Ferrari and Ross Brawn Technical Director after his 13th win of 2004 in Japan Photo by Sutton Images Asked by Motorsport.com after the race in Mexico if his decision to downplay it was a tactic to avoid losing focus Verstappen said he was unsure but that he was never really interested in stats. I just live in the moment Verstappen said. I just try to of course do the best I can every single weekend. I try to win the races and that for me is the most important. Every single weekend when I go home and I can say to myself that I maximised or close to that Im happy. But of course a lot in Formula 1 depends on your whole package  right And we are having a great package and Im just enjoying the moment. Im not that interested in keeping in touch with every stat. But of course it is an amazing season and of course Im very happy with winning so many races. Vettel insisted he has no regrets about losing the record that he shared with close friend and mentor Schumacher. No I mean every time its a bit different he said. I think its great for the team. I still know some people there so Im really happy for them and for Max. Well done. I think hes had a hell of a season so hopefully he gets 16 at the end of the year Everything else will be a disappointment no The Aston Martin driver agreed that sustaining such a level of success is not as easy as it might look from the outside. No its not he said. But obviously I think they had a momentum from last year the car this year is incredible. They won races even though they were heavier than everybody else. I think by now theyve probably got the weight out. So the car is there but Max is doing an amazing job as well.
TECH TUESDAY: The design secrets that set Red Bull’s RB18 apart from its F1 rivals, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.tech-tuesday-the-design-secrets-that-set-red-bulls-rb18-apart-from-its-f1.1ul2YIRb2nFywEwjYLWe0l.html, The Red Bull RB18 will go down as one of the most successful F1 cars in the sports history. Left At Paul Ricard Red Bull moved the two outermost tunnel inlet vanes further apart. Suspension Red Bull like McLaren responded to the new regulations by switching around their suspension from pushrod frontpullrod rear to the opposite. Inset right A beautiful detail is the adjustment of the ride height outside of the pedal box. Red Bull introduced a new engine cover at Silverstone with a channel between the upper and lower parts forming a bulge., The Red Bull RB18 will go down as one of the most successful F1 cars in the sports history. In taking Max Verstappen to his second world title and the team to their fifth constructors championship their first in nine years it has won 16 of the seasons 20 races to date  14 for Verstappen and two for Sergio Perez. It has proven to be a masterwork response to a set of radically new aerodynamic regulations which have been problematic for most other teams. Chief Technical Officer Adrian Newey feeds into the Red Bull technical group which created the car a group that includes Technical Director Pierre Wache Head of Aerodynamics Enrico Balbo Chief Engineering Officer Rob Marshall Chief Designer Craig Skinner Head of Performance Engineering Ben Waterhouse and Chief Engineer car Paul Monaghan. Newey has experience of ground effect cars from much earlier in his career and certainly he will have been aware of some of the possible hazards lying in wait with such a concept of car featuring an arodynamically superpowerful underbody. But Neweys actual design input in this case is limited to the suspension  though that is a crucial part of the cars allround excellence. READ MORE Verstappen makes F1 history as he beats Hamilton to victory in Mexico for 14th win of the season The car is powered by Hondas powerful reliable and compact RA621 a refinement of the power unit introduced in 2021. Around this Red Bull created a car with a distinctive and elegant sidepod layout with a deep undercut at the front beneath the inlet vanes to the venturi tunnels at the heart of the new regulations. Here we look at each of the key design elements of the car and what has differentiated it from its rivals. Verstappen and the RB18 have formed a dominant partnership this season winning 14 races out of 20 so far Floor The underfloor is absolutely key to performance under these regulations with downforce generated by tunnels either side of a central flat keel. The speed of the air flowing through these tunnels and the air pressure differential between the underfloor and the upper surface of the car creates massive downforce effectively sucking the car to the ground. READ MORE Hes been perfect  Horner full of praise after Verstappens recordbreaking victory But Red Bulls treatment of the tunnels is quite different to that of any other car. Others have created a teardropshaped central keel to shape the tunnels around but the Red Bulls keel is far less uniform in shape. The roof of the tunnels also appear to be higher and more arched. The combination of the profile changes of the keel and the varying height of the tunnels seems to be an effort at carefully matching the volume of the tunnel along its length to give a more consistent airflow and at no point has the car been seriously troubled by the porpoising phenomenon seen elsewhere. Ferrari underfloor left contrasted with that of Red Bull right. It can be seen that the central keel of the RB18 floor is nothing like the conventional teardrop shape on the F175. This seems to be part of a very careful matching with the height of the tunnels either side to give a more consistent volume for the airflow. This would theoretically lower the peak downforce generated by the floor but make it far more stallproof and tolerant of different ride heights. The key to these regulations has proved to be not how much peak downforce can be created by the floor through highspeed corners when the rear ride height is low but how much can be retained in slower corners when the ride height is greater. The Red Bulls floor arrangement is much more tolerant of ride height changes than others even if GPS data suggests it doesnt achieve as high a maximum downforce as the Ferrari or the Mercedes in faster corners. READ MORE I never thought Id be able to win 14 races in a year says recordbreaker Verstappen in Mexico Even the profile of the edges of the inlet vanes to the tunnel are nonuniform and seem to be matched to the profile of the tunnel. Red Bull used a variety of inlet vane and floor edge arrangements to tune the car to particular circuits. These changes would vary aero characteristics of the car and the centre of pressure acting upon the front and rear axles. It suggested the team had a very high fidelity control of its underfloor airflow. Left At Paul Ricard Red Bull moved the two outermost tunnel inlet vanes further apart. Although the team regularly tweaked the shape of these vanes to match specific circuit demands this was the biggest change. Right This tonguelike insert in the floor ahead of the rear tyres was introduced at Silverstone and is similar to a feature first seen on the Ferrari. Its believed to relieve excess pressure created in that part of the floor by tyre squirt at low ride heights. Suspension Red Bull like McLaren responded to the new regulations by switching around their suspension from pushrod frontpullrod rear to the opposite. Red Bull felt that the pullrod arrangement at the front  with the rockers up high  allowed a better airflow route to the tunnel inlets while at the rear a pushrod arrangement gave a better stiffer and lighter mechanical installation. Previously the high rockers of a pullrod rear had allowed more scope to powerfully develop the brake duct shapes but with these a standardised item for 2022 that scope was no longer there. MONDAY MORNING DEBRIEF How cunning strategy allowed us to see Ricciardo back at his best in Mexico The rear suspension had a notably long travel to accommodate a variety of ride heights. It would sink very low at high speed to reduce drag even though it usually had a greater static ride height than any other car. This was a key part of the cars consistent straightline speed advantage over the competition. To get the car to sink in such a way would require a relatively soft suspension springing rate and on other cars such a setting would induce bouncing. The Red Bull floors resistance to aerodynamic stalling was probably part of enabling the softer suspension to work. Main image Red Bulls 2022 front suspension in detail. Left inset Red Bulls 2021 pushrod layout. It is now the front upper arm which passes through the chassis whereas previously it was the front lower arm. That upper arm is mounted higher than the rear lower arm not visible here giving an antidive geometry. Inset right A beautiful detail is the adjustment of the ride height outside of the pedal box. On other cars notably the Mercedes the suspension had to be run stiff enough to keep the car outside of the ride heightspeed combinations which would induce bouncing at a frequency and would then cause the car to be bouncing on its tyre sidewalls too. The Red Bull was seemingly completely immune from this. At the front Newey had opted for a multilink arrangement once again with the upper forward link mounted high and the upper rearwards link lower to resist the dive of the car under braking thereby limiting the rear ride height increase and the downforce loss it entails. READ MORE 6 Winners and 5 Losers from the Mexico City Grand Prix  Who left the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez on a high A beautiful detail was having the ride height adjuster on the external part of the suspension usually its within the central part with the rockers for easy access. The multilink arrangement  with separate attachment points for the various suspension links  will be heavier but it allows those links to work more independently and thereby give a better ride quality. This gives a more stable aerodynamic platform. As a side benefit the car will be better over the kerbs. Red Bull introduced a new engine cover at Silverstone with a channel between the upper and lower parts forming a bulge. This both increased the cooling capacity and improved the airflow to the rear corner of the car normally two conflicting requirements.
Hamilton: Alonso’s comments about F1 titles "make me giggle a little bit", https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/hamilton-alonsos-comments-about-f1-titles-make-me-giggle-a-little-bit/10393547/, But in an apparent response to Alonsos comments Hamilton tweeted a picture of them on the podium together at Indianapolis in 2007 when they were teammates at McLaren accompanied with a single thumbs up emoji. Asked for his reaction to Alonsos comments and about the post Hamilton said I gave you my reaction. It does make me giggle a little bit to be honest but I have tried to be really respectful over the years. Lewis Hamilton McLaren and Fernando Alonso McLaren Photo by Steven Tee  Motorsport ImagesIts definitely interesting to see the comments that are made but it doesnt really matter. So thats why I just kind of put the thumbs up.Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff also brushed off Alonsos comments saying the twotime world champion was a teaser and it was comedy and that he doubted Hamilton cared., In an interview with Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf that was published last Saturday Alonso discussed the value of F1 titles won against drivers from other teams compared to those fought only against a teammate. Alonso took to Twitter after the quotes began to circulate to say that all titles are amazing and he was tired of the continuous search for headlines as well as suggesting F1 fans should stop being pitted against each other on social media. But in an apparent response to Alonsos comments Hamilton tweeted a picture of them on the podium together at Indianapolis in 2007 when they were teammates at McLaren accompanied with a single thumbs up emoji. Hamilton won that race ahead of Alonso who was left fuming at his McLaren team amid a tense season that resulted in Alonso leaving at the end of the year. Asked for his reaction to Alonsos comments and about the post Hamilton said I gave you my reaction. Thats my thumbs up. I dont really have a lot to say about it. It does make me giggle a little bit to be honest but I have tried to be really respectful over the years. For example when youve ever asked me about who has been the better driver for me Ive always tried to give praise. Lewis Hamilton McLaren and Fernando Alonso McLaren Photo by Steven Tee  Motorsport Images Its definitely interesting to see the comments that are made but it doesnt really matter. So thats why I just kind of put the thumbs up. Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff also brushed off Alonsos comments saying the twotime world champion was a teaser and it was comedy and that he doubted Hamilton cared. It creates headlines and this sport is about headlines said Wolff. Theyre great champions. Alonso likes to throw one in. I dont think its bothering Lewis a millimetre. In the wake of the response to his comments Alonso said on Sunday when asked about Max Verstappens new win record that he would not speak any more about anyone else because I think theres always misunderstanding. It was not the first time there had been some tension emerging from comments Alonso made about Hamilton this year. Following their collision on the opening lap of the Belgian Grand Prix in August Alonso called Hamilton an idiot over team radio and claimed the seventime world champion could only race starting first. He later apologised for the comment.
‘I’m hoping it’s not a trend’ says Binotto after Ferrari’s lacklustre performance in Mexico, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.im-hoping-its-not-a-trend-says-binotto-after-ferraris-lacklustre-performance.742BKVgS7q55tOB51tG36X.html, But team boss Mattia Binotto was keen to take some positives from the race especially concerning strategy which has been an Achilles heel for the team at times this season. Mercedes is coming back theyve looked more competitive than we did here Binotto said after the race. Lewis Hamilton has been in contention for the win on the past two race weekends  but Binotto doesnt believe that his team have slipped as much down the pecking order as the time sheets in Mexico would indicate. The one after  Japan  yes it was very wet we were not as fast as Max Verstappen but it was not a drama certainly not in quali he said. Then in the States in Austin again I think in the quali we were competitive then not as much as we expected in the race., Carlos Sainz predicted a sixway fight for the win in Mexico but come race day Mercedes and Red Bull were the ones contesting the victory while Ferrari fell off the pace and finished nearly a minute behind their rivals with Sainz fifth and Charles Leclerc in sixth. But team boss Mattia Binotto was keen to take some positives from the race especially concerning strategy which has been an Achilles heel for the team at times this season. READ MORE It was really lonely  Leclerc and Sainz reflect on disappointing outing for Ferrari in Mexico But while their decision to start on the soft tyres and finish on the mediums should have paid dividends it was a lack of power that seemed to be their downfall at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez. The altitude could have been a factor  coupled with the fact that unlike their rivals they opted to switch focus to developing their 2023 car at a pretty early stage this year. Mercedes is coming back theyve looked more competitive than we did here Binotto said after the race. We know we stopped development on our car quite early focussing on 2023 and somehow Im not too let me say concerned by the rate of development because I know when we stopped developing it. Leclerc has slipped five points behind Perez in the drivers standings now With both titles long since wrapped up by Red Bull and Max Verstappen it may seem there is little left to play for but finishing P2 in the constructors championship is still the teams target and one that is not a foregone conclusion given Mercedes are 40 points behind them but have been in much improved form at the last two races. Lewis Hamilton has been in contention for the win on the past two race weekends  but Binotto doesnt believe that his team have slipped as much down the pecking order as the time sheets in Mexico would indicate. MUSTSEE Get all the angles as McLaren nail the first subtwo second pit stop of 2022 Certainly if I look at the last three races it has not always been great but Singapore we were very competitive. The one after  Japan  yes it was very wet we were not as fast as Max Verstappen but it was not a drama certainly not in quali he said. Then in the States in Austin again I think in the quali we were competitive then not as much as we expected in the race. Here Mexico I think its a lot worse so I dont think its the same trend Singapore competitive Japan not too bad USA good quali so I think here it has been a lot more difficult and Im hoping its not a trend just an outlying weekend for us. Sainz at least saw the chequered flag on Sunday for the first time since Singapore
How F1 teams reacted to Mexico’s high-altitude headaches, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/how-f1-teams-reacted-to-mexicos-high-altitude-headaches/10393735/, All of this leads to teams running what might otherwise be considered odd choices given its such a highspeed venue. It was a similar story at the rear of the car too as both drivers flirted with different arrangements. The team also had the option of incorporating a Gurney flap on the trailing edge of the main engine cover outlet in order to help with extraction. Alpha Tauri AT03 cooling panel comparisonMeanwhile at the rear of the car the engine covers bodywork was expanded. This not only increased the size of the rear cooling outlet but also resulted in a larger rear deck upon which the air flowed to the rear of the car., Listen to this article At 2285m above sea level the rarefied air creates a significant challenge in respect of car aerodynamics cooling requirements and the performance envelope of the power unit. All of this leads to teams running what might otherwise be considered odd choices given its such a highspeed venue. Mercedes experimented with its wing levels on Friday not only as a means to hone in on the performance levels of the car at this venue but also for gathering meaningful data for next years car too. Comparing the two front wings put into service during free practice outings Lewis Hamiltons car was fitted with the older specification version with the trailing edge of the upper flap cut back quite significantly left image below. Meanwhile George Russells W13 was fitted with the new wing design which features a revised design to the outer section of the flaps and a more contoured endplate to help generate outwash. However the team did opt to remove the controversial slot gap separator brackets that first appeared at the United States Grand Prix but remain unraced. Youll also note that chequerboard stickers were adhered to the front wing endplate on Hamiltons car with a camera used to capture footage of the wing whilst its out on track in order that the team can ascertain its performing as anticipated. It was a similar story at the rear of the car too as both drivers flirted with different arrangements. George Russell carried a Gurney flap mounted on the trailing edge of the rear wing whilst Hamilton matching the cutdown approach taken with the front wing was running the wing without one on his. Following the tests conducted by Hamilton on Friday both drivers opted for the newer front wing specification with a more loaded flap arrangement plus the Gurney on the trailing edge of the rear wings upper flap for qualifying and the race. Meanwhile the maximum cooling option was taken up on both cars with the panels beside the cockpit and the engine cover gills both opened up in order to reject the heat being generated. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes W13 Photo by Steven Tee  Motorsport Images Red Bull also opted for more cooling to meet the demands being posed as the RB18 ran with the louvred cooling panels on the shoulder of the engine cover and a new wider cooling exit at the rear that also flared on the trailing edge to help with extraction. McLaren decided to take cooling in Mexico pretty seriously as several new options appeared in order to deal with the demands posed by the circuit and altitude. A more expansive louvred cooling panel could be found traversing the MCL36s sidepod and engine cover with two outlets also added to its cooling suite on the engine covers spine one of these is mounted above the power unit saddle coolers and the other is just aft of the shark fin red arrows. The team also had the option of incorporating a Gurney flap on the trailing edge of the main engine cover outlet in order to help with extraction. To increase local load at the rear of the car McLaren had also made changes to its rear brake duct aero adding some winglets to the stack already present on the rearwardfacing outlet scoop. Alpine also deployed its maximum cooling configuration as the A522 was fitted with the open louvred sidepod bodywork and the enlarged engine cover outlet panel that was last seen in Hungary but not raced. Alpine F1 A522 cooling detail Photo by Giorgio Piola Alpha Tauri invested in revisions to help with its temperature issues in Mexico too as the AT03s front brakes featured an enlarged rear outlet scoop resulting in an increase in mass flow through the assembly. The cooling gill panel on the side of the engine cover was also revised with the number of louvres reduced but their spacing increased as they still filled the same available space within the panel. Alpha Tauri AT03 cooling panel comparison Meanwhile at the rear of the car the engine covers bodywork was expanded. This not only increased the size of the rear cooling outlet but also resulted in a larger rear deck upon which the air flowed to the rear of the car. Alfa Romeo has been proactive in the closing stages of the season as it not only looks to fend off the challenge posed by Aston Martin but also invest in designs that will carry across to its 2023 challenger. And whilst not a new feature having been used at other high downforce venues the larger rear wing endplate tip cutout used in Mexico is a feature worthy of our attention owing to its impact on the resultant tip vortex being generated. Alfa Romeo C42 rear wing cutout comparison Photo by Giorgio Piola Compared with the medium downforce wings cutout inset theres a clear difference in approach with its high downforce arrangement as the flap is undercut red arrow. This is the result of the team looking for a better tradeoff between the downforce and drag being generated given it is trying to maintain as much wingspan as possible. The team has also made changes to the forward section of the floor over the course of the last two races as it looks to increase the downforce being generated and its working range. This includes changes to the outermost floor fence and the point at which it connects with the side of the chassis.
The last time a Formula 1 team fell out with a TV broadcaster, https://www.planetf1.com/news/formula-1-team-tv-broadcaster-fallout/, Max Verstappen and Red Bull pressed mute on broadcaster Sky Sports in Mexico although it was not the first example of a media spat in Formula 1. Then postrace Sky used mixedzone interviews with Verstappen and his teammate Sergio Perez while Red Bull team principal Christian Horner who usually appears for an interview at every round did not do so. But this year its been a constant yeah kind of like daily being disrespectful especially one particular person said Verstappen. Renault had previously blocked the Dutch broadcaster from onetoone access with Daniel Ricciardo as they reportedly wanted to ask the Australian if Verstappen was better than him. Read more Christian Horner discusses decision to support Max Verstappens Sky F1 boycott, Max Verstappen and Red Bull pressed mute on broadcaster Sky Sports in Mexico although it was not the first example of a media spat in Formula 1. Word surfaced that Verstappen had taken issue with Sky Sports coverage relating to one individual at the broadcaster in particular believed to be their pitlane reporter Ted Kravitz who on several occasions had used the word robbed when discussing how Lewis Hamilton had missed out on the 2021 title to Verstappen. With Red Bull said to have joined in Verstappens silence multiple occurrences during Skys Mexican Grand Prix race coverage suggested that was true starting with Martin Brundles grid walk when he had the opportunity to approach Red Bulls design chief Adrian Newey but did not. Then postrace Sky used mixedzone interviews with Verstappen and his teammate Sergio Perez while Red Bull team principal Christian Horner who usually appears for an interview at every round did not do so. Verstappen postrace confirmed his stance and explained it. It had nothing to do with this weekend. But this year its been a constant yeah kind of like daily being disrespectful especially one particular person said Verstappen. And its enough I dont accept it. You cant live in the past. You just have to move on. Social media is a very toxic place and if you are constantly being like that live on TV you make it only worse instead of trying to make it better. You keep disrespecting me and at one point Im not tolerating it anymore. Thats why I decided to stop answering them. Horner has said Verstappen and the Red Bull team will be talking to Sky at the next event the Sao Paulo Grand Prix so bar any further fallouts that should be the end of the matter. But fallouts with the media are not unheard of  just ask Renault. In 2020 Ziggo Sports Jack Plooij issued an apology after he called Renault driver Esteban Ocon a French f on live television while he was interviewing Lando Norris. Ocon accepted the apology although that was not the first time Ziggo Sport had found themselves in hot water with Renault. Renault had previously blocked the Dutch broadcaster from onetoone access with Daniel Ricciardo as they reportedly wanted to ask the Australian if Verstappen was better than him.

Binotto: Mercedes' strategy calls show not only Ferrari make mistakes, https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1016141/1/binotto-mercedes-strategy-calls-show-not-only-ferrari-make-mistakes, Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto whose teams strategy has come under scrutiny several times this season thinks Mercedes threw away two potential victories. Mercedes maybe have lost the last race as well by not choosing the right tyres in Austin. I think we would have still had the edge but they Mercedes would have been a lot closer Horner said. He controlled the race from the very beginning on those soft tyres not warming them up too quickly making sure there was longevity to them he added. But I think that the onestop mediumhard looked like the right strategy., Lewis Hamilton has been forced to settle for runnerup spot behind Red Bulls Max Verstappen at consecutive races in Austin and Mexico City as he missed the chance to end his and Mercedes winless drought in 2022.

In Hungary we have been criticised and its normally when we are doing things which are not completely right we are criticised he said. Mercedes maybe have lost the last race as well by not choosing the right tyres in Austin. So I think its not only down to us somehow to make different choices or making mistakes. Binotto said it was always clear to Ferrari that running a softtomedium strategy was the best way to go in Mexico. We saw that there was not much degradation on the soft or sufficient to run a onestop softmedium and we went for it he explained. Certainly then in the race we had as well to manage our tyres to make sure that were surviving on a onestop and that maybe as well is part of the cause of our slow pace of today. So managing tyres has been certainly an item a subject for us today. But still we believe that softmedium was the right choice for the race. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner also took a swipe at rivals Mercedes revealing his surprise at their tyre strategy. I think we would have still had the edge but they Mercedes would have been a lot closer Horner said. You could hear their drivers were not very happy about the hard tyre and thats the second weekend in a row that theyve put that tyre on and its cost them a victory so I was quite surprised at that. Horner also praised Verstappens tyremanagement describing it as masterful. He controlled the race from the very beginning on those soft tyres not warming them up too quickly making sure there was longevity to them he added. Actually when they came off the car there was still a lot of life left in them. That gave us even more confidence that the medium tyre would be fine as a onestop. It was a question of not abusing that tyre which is something he has been masterful at this year. Mercedes admit tactical error Both Hamilton and teammate George Russell were unhappy with their hard tyres and questioned Mercedes decision in Mexico. After Sundays race Toto Wolff admitted his team made a mistake in hindsight. In hindsight its always easier to judge he said. But I think that the onestop mediumhard looked like the right strategy. That the medium at the end held on for so long came as a surprise. But the hindsight is the thing. If we were to restart the race maybe we would choose a different tyre. Wolff added We felt the soft was strong when we discussed it this morning but not strong enough to really go 30 laps or so. Our models said that a softhard would go. Our models didnt say that a softmedium would go. It could have been to lose more time on the medium and hang it out there for another five six laps and then try to do 30 laps on the soft. But also that was not a given that it would hold on with Daniel you could see that it was possible. Wolff also conceded Mexico likely presented Mercedes with their best chance of winning a race this season. On the simulations it says yes he concluded.

The compromise that forced Ferrari into a dire F1 weekend, https://the-race.com/formula-1/the-compromise-that-forced-ferrari-into-a-dire-f1-weekend/, Its been 113 days since Ferrari won a Formula 1 race and its a wait that might continue for quite some time based on its hopeless Mexican Grand Prix weekend. That led to Ferrari deciding to compromise its power unit performance in Mexico to ensure it wouldnt suffer from similar reliability problems. That compromise centred around the turbo in Ferraris power unit which is smaller than the turbos used by its rivals. Binotto also indicated that Ferrari would need a full review to find out exactly what went so badly wrong. A full review followed that race where Ferrari appeared to understand its problems and rectify them for another lowdownforce track at Monza two weeks later., Its been 113 days since Ferrari won a Formula 1 race and its a wait that might continue for quite some time based on its hopeless Mexican Grand Prix weekend. Ironically arguably its worst performance of 2022 in Mexico City has its roots in one of its finest races of the year at the Austrian Grand Prix where Charles Leclerc took Ferraris last grand prix victory. While Leclerc passed Verstappen three times to win at the Red Bull Ring his teammate Carlos Sainz was denied a chance to make it a Ferrari 12 when his car caught fire. The Austrian circuit is one of the higheraltitude tracks on the calendar but Mexico Citys altitude is over three times as high. That led to Ferrari deciding to compromise its power unit performance in Mexico to ensure it wouldnt suffer from similar reliability problems. That compromise centred around the turbo in Ferraris power unit which is smaller than the turbos used by its rivals. Smaller turbos can generate as much power as larger turbos by running faster and they need to run even faster when the air is thinner at high altitudes like in Mexico. The level at which Ferraris smaller turbo would have needed to run at would have put it at risk of a failure so it elected to turn down the power of the turbo. This stripped what had previously been an advantage away from Ferrari as usually its smaller turbo requires less electrical energy and subsequently has a significant acceleration advantage out of the corners. Sainz and Leclerc were therefore powerless to do any better than fifth and sixth in the race finishing almost a minute behind race winner Max Verstappen  Ferraris biggest race deficit of 2022. And what makes that deficit even worse is the fact that Ferrari  unlike on numerous prior occasions in the 2022 F1 season  was on completely the right race strategy. It has certainly been a very difficult weekend team boss Mattia Binotto admitted after the race. Already yesterday in qualifying we were quite behind the pole position Sainz was 0.576 seconds adrift of pole and only 0.05s quicker than the Alfa Romeo of Valtteri Bottas who beat his teammate Leclerc normally in the qualy we are quite competitive. In the race it has simply emphasised that we were not comfortable with the track this weekend. Our overall performance has not been great no doubt. We were off the pace in the race. The compromise that both of the drivers are mentioning we were not at our best performance for the weekend in terms of the power unit. Ferraris flaws title failure and relief  Leclerc interview Read more But Binotto was quick to stress that the power unit compromise was only part of the equation and not the only cause with FP2 being used as a tyre test among the other contributing factors. However the compromise likely affected other areas such as the challenge of trying to find the right balance and setup with a different power output to any other race this year and the aforementioned nullification of Ferraris typical 2022 acceleration advantage. This likely contributed to a somewhat erratic F175 this weekend that looked nervous on the kerbs and through the Esses section in particular. It was a fight. Thats why I couldnt put a lap together Sainz said after qualifying and Leclercs off in second practice was further evidence of the imbalance. But it clearly doesnt explain all of Ferraris woes and continues a worrying trend for Ferrari in the second half of a 2022 season that it started with the fastest car. Binotto also indicated that Ferrari would need a full review to find out exactly what went so badly wrong. The team has been here before. It suffered a miserable weekend in Spa after the summer break as it was utterly powerless to stop Verstappen from romping from 14th on the grid to win while Leclerc finished sixth and well over a minute back despite starting one place behind Verstappen. A full review followed that race where Ferrari appeared to understand its problems and rectify them for another lowdownforce track at Monza two weeks later. Already in Spa it has been very similar where we have been very slow and it was more outstanding anomalous in terms of bad pace said Binotto. Here is similar its something we need to look at and try to react to for the last two races. Reacting in Brazil might be tough as the Interlagos circuit is marginally higher than the Red Bull Ring venue that prompted Ferraris adjustment. Its still way off the altitude that forced Ferraris most extreme power unit compromise of the season but we still may see a smaller one in Brazil to avoid further reliability issues at a time where DNFs would leave it vulnerable to Mercedes in the constructors championship.
Wolff pinpoints 'single decision last October' as the reason behind Mercedes' 2022 performance | Formula 1�, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.wolff-pinpoints-single-decision-last-october-as-the-reason-behind-mercedes.1kLKRTyZBApInVtk2Lh8bb.html, Toto Wolff believes a development call some 12 months ago was the moment Mercedes got it wrong with the development of their 2022 car as he reflected on the teams efforts to bring the W13 up to speed.

But team principal Horner has updated about their stance There were some derogatory comments made so we took a break from Sky for this race. 5 Tracks That F1 NEED to Bring Back Video of 5 Tracks That F1 NEED to Bring Back Max was upset. We were upset and we made the decision to stand together as a team. It wont have done Sky any harm for us to lay down a marker. Some of the commentary is fair but some pieces are sensationalist and saying we robbed anyone of the championship as was said in Austin is going too far. It is not impartial or fair or balanced. We have said our piece and will go back to normal next race. What did Ted Kravitz say After the F1 United States Grand Prix he said Lewis Hamilton doesnt win a race all year and then finally comes back at a track where he could win the first race all year battling the same guy who won the race he was robbed in the previous year and manages to finish ahead of him. What a script and a story that would have been. But thats not the way the script turned out today was it Because the guy that beat him after being robbed actually overtook him because hes got a quicker car because of engineering and Formula One and design and pretty much because of Adrian Newey Red Bulls chief technical officer over there. What was Max Verstappens response Its been a constant kind of like digging being disrespectful especially one particular person  and at one point it is enough I dont accept it.

However due to red flags caused by other drivers during a Friday FP1 practice session with Williams in Mexico City Sargeant amassed just 96 kmmeaning he fell one lap short. Nonetheless Sargeant is on a healthy 30 points and is in line to comfortably reach the 40point threshold if he has a smooth final Formula 2 weekend in Abu Dhabi. And he is still learning. Williams has said that Sergeant will replace Nicholas Latifiif Sargeant can complete is Super License requirement. I was definitely a lot more comfortable said Sargeant after his session. Everything slowed down a lot and it was easier to build a rhythm and learn the track. All in all it was a good step forward and good progress from last weekend in Austin. Chinas 2023 F1 Hosting Hopes Fading The pandemic has kept Formula 1 from China since 2019. Charles Coates Getty Images China has not featured on Formula 1s calendar since 2019 due to the pandemic and the countrys Covid Zero policyto which Chinese president Xi Jinping recently recommitted means it effectively remains cutoff from the remainder of the world. There are still strict entry measures and quarantine which is currently immutable for Formula 1. Next years event is scheduled for April 16 but it is understood that it is an unlikely proposition. In the case that such a scenario unfolds. Formula 1 would not replace China reducing the calendar from 24 to 23 Grands Prix which still remains a record. One schedule change should China fall off the calendar would be for Azerbaijan scheduled for April 30 to move one week earlier. That would avoid having Azerbaijan and Miami race on backtoback weekends. Few in the paddock are looking forward to that backtoback scheduling. Hamiltons Little Alonso Dig Lewis Hamilton is not one to get shortchanged on social media. Eric Alonso Getty Images Fernando Alonso has taken to making sly remarks at some of his opponents across the years and in an interview with Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf he suggested that Max Verstappens two titles were worthier than Lewis Hamiltons seven. Once the headline was out Alonso made an attempt to clarify his comments insisting drivers shouldnt be compared but Hamilton got his dig at Alonso with a very cheeky post on Twitter. This content is imported from Twitter. You may be able to find the same content in another format or you may be able to find more information at their web site. It does make me giggle a little bit to be honest but I have tried to be really respectful over the years and for example when youve ever asked me about who has been the better driver for me Ive always tried to give praise said Hamilton when asked about the post. But its definitely interesting to see the comments that are made but it doesnt really matter. So thats why I just kind of put the thumbs up. De Vries Gets Abu Dhabi Test Nyck de Vries practices with Mercedes in Mexico City. Jam Media Getty Images Nyck de Vries has been a busy man. De Vries has fulfilled young driver duties for employers Mercedes Aston Martin and Williams had a private outing with Alpine and also made an impressive lastminute race debut for Williams which captured the attention of AlphaTauri. With Mercedes having released de Vries for 2023 AlphaTauri will run de Vries for a full day at the postseason young driver test in Abu Dhabi on November 22. That means De Vries will end up driving for half of the 10 teams in a window of around three months. Too Busy Mexico City Paddock Lewis Hamilton center makes his way through a crowded paddock in Mexico City. Peter J Fox Getty Images Drivers and the FIA are set to talk at the next briefing in Brazil over paddock overcrowding. Formula 1s popularity has ballooned in recent years but there were more than a few occasions of drivers being seriously accosted when trying to manoeuvre their way around what remains a work environment. Drivers are cognizant of the need to satisfy fans but frequently in Mexico City especially among the leading contingent they were mobbed. Several spoke afterward of the need for fans particularly adults to respect boundaries with security having been tightened due to the situation. Mexico Citys paddock is one of the most vibrant and enthusiastic of the campaign but for 2023 there will surely be some additional measures put in place.

The eighttime race winner now looks set to take a year off either away from the sport completely or with a reserve role at Mercedes or Red Bull with the hope of getting back into F1 in 2024. Button however believes that is the wrong decision for his future.

Even though there is a stark contrast between Formula 1 drivers zooming 200 mph and golfers taking 5 hours to play a round the science and engineering behind the equipment both sports use is more similar than you might think. For starters both sports adhere to strict rules set forth by governing bodies. In Formula 1s case that is FIA Fdration Internationale de lAutomobile in golf rulesmaking duties are shared by the USGA United States Golf Association and RA Royal  Ancient. FIA and USGA regulate their respective sports FIAUSGA The biggest contrast between the two sports regulations is that golfs rules are universal i.e. they apply to any competition regardless of skill level in any professional or amateur event while F1 rules apply only to that specific league. F1 regulations are also constantly shifting based on technology while golfs base rules have been around for longer than automobiles have existed. These regulations force engineers to look for any possible advantage written within the rules to create a legal advantage versus other teams. In the case of golf each manufacturer has its own philosophy when it comes to designing equipment geared toward their stable of players just as some F1 cars are tuned to driving styles. Aerodynamics play a huge part in design Formula One  FIA One of the best comparisons from golf to F1 is how some teams prioritize straightline speed vs. cornering in the same way some golf OEMs put a priority on forgiveness vs. trying to create extra workability. Engineers in both sports have to strike the perfect balance of which attributes they believe are going to offer the most competitive edge. The advantage golf club engineers have is they can segment their designs to fit various demographics of golfers Formula 1 engineers meanwhile can design only one car. The hypercompetitive nature of golf and Formula 1 has engineers and designers keeping ideas close to their vests and constantly pushing the limits to find performance within the rules. In both sports engineers will go as far as looking beyond the wording of regulations to find different interpretations of how the rules are written. In golf this process is cut and dry  a piece of equipment is either conforming or nonconforming but that doesnt mean engineers wont get a little weird. Ping Doc17 putter Ping Golf The Ping Doc17 to this day is one of the wildest examples of a putter that pushed the rules to the absolute limit. The 17 in Doc17 represents the length of the face from heel to toe in centimeters. The USGA limit is set at 17.78 cm but Doc17 sounds way better than Doc17.78. Formula 1 engineers get a little more outside of the box. An example of this is how Aston Martin redesigned their rear wing based on the radii set within the regulations. Aston Martins modified 2022 rear wing design Formula One There is a whole bunch of stuff going on here but in the simplest terms by continuing the radius of the side wing to create a round rail Aston Martin kept the top of the side wing whole compared to others that have a small channel that flows down to connect to the car. Ferraris F1 rear wing design Giorgio Piola Just like how every improved mishit helps keep a golf ball online every partial second gained per lap in a 190mile F1 race adds up and can be the difference between being in the points the top 10 in F1 and going home with nothing. Lastly just as golfers tune their equipment to different course styles and ground conditions F1 races are conducted all over the world meaning tweaks need to be made to the car the same way golfers need to adjust club selection at altitude. The recent Mexico Grand Prix held in Mexico City was well above sea level and the less dense air had cars traveling faster for the same reason a golf ball travels farther  less air resistance equals more output for the same input. Now if we could only get PGA Tour players to finish a round in the same time it takes an F1 driver to complete 190 miles we might find a way to pick up the pace of play.

Ten things we learned from the 2022 F1 Mexican GP, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/10-things-we-learned-from-the-2022-mexican-grand-prix/10393435/, Listen to this articleTheres little escaping that the Mexican Grand Prix last weekend ultimately failed to deliver on the thrilling climax it teased at certain points. All told here are 10 things we learned from the 2022 Mexican Grand Prix. Red Bull therefore took umbrage with the sensationalisation and chose the Mexico weekend to stop giving exclusive interviews to Sky Sports. Red Bull which did similar by pulling interviews with Sky at Abu Dhabi last year says normal service will be resumed for Brazil. The excess is down to failing to include elements such as social security contributions for staff apprenticeship levies cost of use of the power units and a clerical error in the calculation of costs recharged to Red Bull by Red Bull Powertrains among others., Listen to this article Theres little escaping that the Mexican Grand Prix last weekend ultimately failed to deliver on the thrilling climax it teased at certain points. That meant at a time when the FIA went public with its contentious punishment for Red Bull breaking the 2021 cost cap there was an equal split between on and offtrack talking points. Max Verstappen writing his name into more pages of the history books as he broke another two Formula 1 records thanks to his latest victory Mercedes upping the pace but coming overall conservative with its strategy plus a rejuvenated showing from Daniel Ricciardo were among the lean highlights from the 71 laps of the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez. Away from the asphalt the atmosphere at high altitude was a lot more fraught. Sky Sports couldnt cut to Christian Horner on the pitwall as Red Bull boycotted the broadcaster just hours after the team had been busy explaining its exceeding of the budget cap. Fernando Alonso finally had a resolution to the protest of the protest of his result in the United States Grand Prix and its looking like both the Mexico round and Lewis Hamilton will be sticking around for a little while longer. All told here are 10 things we learned from the 2022 Mexican Grand Prix. Max Verstappen celebrates a recordbreaking 14th win in a single season Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images 1. Victorious Verstappen has broken another two F1 records While there were some complaints from the cockpit of the 1 RB18 during the first stint as his soft tyres began to tear polesitter Max Verstappen would soon take total control of the 71 laps in Mexico City and come to look unflappable on his way to victory by 15.186s over Lewis Hamilton. The twotime world champions latest triumph increased his tally of wins in 2022 up to 14 which meant he surpassed the 13strong record shared by Sebastian Vettel 2013 and Michael Schumacher 2004 for the most successful season in Formula 1 history. Verstappens reaction was Another great race but also its just an incredible season for us as a team. I never thought I would be able to win 14 races in a year. Im incredibly proud. Quite astonishingly that wasnt the only record Verstappen broke when he reached the chequered flag. With the full score of 25 for first place secured the Dutch ace now counts 416 points for his efforts this year. That meant he moved clear of Hamiltons 2019 record of 413 and thats still with two races including a sprint round to go. But even if Verstappen claims the spoils in Brazil and Abu Dhabi his win percentage will fall just shy of Alberto Ascaris 75 in 1952. On the points score Verstappen added Hopefully we can score a few more but its not about that. At the end of the day its all about trying to win a championship and it doesnt matter with how many points you do it but it does show we are having an incredible year. Mercedes reticence to take a gamble in Mexico cost it a shot at victory Photo by Steven Tee  Motorsport Images 2. Mercedes played it much too safe to end its winless run It surely seemed as though the United States Grand Prix offered Mercedes its best chance of getting off the mark in 2022. Max Verstappen was held for 15s in a calamitous pitstop. That Lewis Hamilton couldnt then hold off the chasing Red Bull to win indicated that only a major malady befalling the lead RB18 might put the W13s on the top step of the podium. But that sentiment only lasted seven days. With Verstappen leading away on softs before struggling with degradation while Hamilton and George Russell ran longer on their starting medium tyres it appeared as though a cute Silver Arrows strategy and decent management of the rubber could put the duo in contention for victory more or less on merit. Onehalf of that attack was subdued when Hamilton stopped for hard tyres to carry him to the flag but the whitewalled rubber immediately dropped him off the pace. Even race engineer Peter Bonnington struggled to justify the call over team radio. No matter Russell had stayed out longer was still happy on the mediums showing consistent pace and was telling the pitwall to keep him out until it was time for a sprint on soft tyres to the end. Then he too was stopped for hard tyres. Likewise his progress was slowed. That meant Russell had been kept out to no good effect as Mercedes effectively secured its driver of fourth place rather than at least ask questions of their rival outfit by putting late pressure on Verstappen and Sergio Perez  even if it would have required Russell passing both on track. Likewise Mercedes kept both its drivers on the same strategy rather than twist to stand a better chance of causing an upset. That was the bad news for Mercedes. And the bad news for spectators and TV viewers is that any kind of crescendo to a tame Mexican GP fizzled out almost entirely. Having struggled with the altitude in Mexico Ferrari crossed the line in a distant 56 finish Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images 3. Ferrari is on course to finish this promising campaign with a whimper Bar a sticking frontright wheel change that cost Carlos Sainz a second at his pitstop it was virtually an anonymous outing for Ferrari. The two red cars were more conspicuous for their absence from the lead fight as Sainz crossed the line nigh on a minute adrift of victor Max Verstappen as he clocked fifth to his teammates sixth. It was the Scuderias worst result since Leclerc crashed out of the lead of the French Grand Prix. The Mexico weekend was particularly troublesome for Ferrari as it managed only fifth and seventh in qualifying with Leclerc constantly fighting a twitchy F175 and even shunting backwards into the wall in FP2. The pair were split by Valtteri Bottas on Saturday who was only 0.05s shy of being the fastest Ferraripowered driver of the lot. Team boss Mattia Binotto put some of the blame on the power unit and having to turn down the turbo in highaltitude conditions. While internal expectations are for a return to form in Brazil it wasnt quite a oneoff to instantly forget and move on from. Although the pressure of both titles is now off to leave the team to focus on executing clean strategy and perfect pitstops Sainz failed to finish in both Japan and the United States  although he was the innocent party at Austin. Leclerc meanwhile copped a penalty at Suzuka for missing the chicane because he was running out of ideas to keep a faster Sergio Perez behind. Then in America having once been part of a threecar fight for the lead after recovering so strongly from an engine change penalty he dropped 7.5s back with tyre degradation. If Nico Rosbergs 2016 title success was launched off the back of his stellar end to 2015 these recent races suggest Ferrari isnt striving to copy a similar strategy. Daniel Ricciardo enjoyed arguably his best performance of 2022 with a vintage attacking display Photo by Mark Sutton  Motorsport Images 4. Ricciardo offers a reminder of his Red Bull and Renault peak Daniel Ricciardo will not race in F1 in 2023 unless making a substitute appearance as part of his widely expected move to become a reserve driver. This he hopes will better position him to join a more competitive team in time for 2024. That is a strategic gamble. One which if it backfires could lead to the Australian bowing out of his GP career in two races time without anyone really acknowledging the occasion. The eighttime F1 race winner remains hugely popular so few want to see that set of events unfold. But should they transpire the Mexican GP gave many a reminder of the driver the championship would be missing out on. Granted Ricciardos move on Yuki Tsunoda that eliminated the AlphaTauri was clumsy  a far cry from the flawless lick the stamp and send it moves that meant Ricciardo could pass at will from miles back into the first chicane at Monza for example. Rightly he copped a 10s penalty. Also it must be considered that his late turn of pace was due to running with the soft tyre. Nevertheless after pitting on lap 44 Ricciardo delivered arguably the finest stint of his admittedly dismal campaign. His management of the medium tyres to nurse them to nearly twothirds race distance was impressive as he worked his way from 11th to eighth. Then came his charge as he passed Tsunoda one way or another forced McLaren to ask Lando Norris to move aside Valtteri Bottas and both Alpines to score seventh. Such was his turn of speed that he cleared away from Esteban Ocon to effectively render his penalty meaningless as he didnt drop a place and was voted Driver of the Day by viewers. After nudging Lance Stroll off the road Pierre Gasly is perilously close to a race ban Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images 5. Gasly is enduring an agonising AlphaTauri arrivederci At a cursory glance just missing out on scoring points in 11th might seem like no mean feat for Pierre Gasly in view of the uninspiring form of the AlphaTauri throughout much of this season. That classification and a strong second stint on the optimal soft tyres to gain places late on however still dont entirely mask recent weekends dogged by underperformance and absolute frustration from a driver who only has two races left at the team before his move to Alpine for 2023. The iffy batch of brakes hurt both AT03 drivers in Japan and yet Yuki Tsunoda made the most of a bad lot to qualify well ahead of Gasly. A similar story was true of Mexico when as both contended with a lack of grip on the lesserused asphalt again Tsunoda was the faster of the duo. Gasly was then overzealous in his battle to get back past the Aston Martin of Lance Stroll who had nicked him at the start. That earned a 5s penalty to go with his reprimands at Suzuka and Austin and is he now seriously running the risk of a race ban for racking up too many penalty points on his licence. Its become a run of bad form rather than just poor luck. Whats more all the incidents have been accompanied by the soundtrack of Gaslys fury over team radio just as he is ready to bid the team for which he has started 94 of his 106 grands prix farewell. Red Bull turned its back on Sky through the weekend having been unhappy with criticism from the broadcaster Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images 6. Red Bull wasnt talking to sensationalist Sky Sports Among all the excitement of Brad Pitt rocking up to the United States Grand Prix Sky Sports reporter Ted Kravitz was supposing what the plot of the forthcoming Formula 1 Hollywood blockbuster might be. His source material was the 2021 title fight in which he repeatedly referred to a driver being robbed of the championship spoils. The subtext was more like plain text. Red Bull therefore took umbrage with the sensationalisation and chose the Mexico weekend to stop giving exclusive interviews to Sky Sports. No cutting to Christian Horner midrace as his leg shakes on the pitwall. No postrace debriefs with Max Verstappen Sergio Perez and so on  the UK TV rights holder had to make do with splicing in clips of the Red Bull protagonists speaking to the central F1TV interviewers. Red Bull which did similar by pulling interviews with Sky at Abu Dhabi last year says normal service will be resumed for Brazil. Red Bull accepted its budget cap transgression as its penalty was unveiled before the Mexico weekend Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images 7. Red Bull has effectively admitted to breaking the 2021 cost cap That Red Bull has accepted the terms of an Accepted Breach Agreement from the FIA in relation to exceeding the 2021 cost cap means the team has effectively held it hands up to the wrongdoing. But its not a straightforward blackandwhite transgression. Red Bull submitted numbers below the budget cap limit  in line with the team declaring its innocence all along  but excluded costs covering 13 areas that ultimately took it over the threshold by close to 2m. The excess is down to failing to include elements such as social security contributions for staff apprenticeship levies cost of use of the power units and a clerical error in the calculation of costs recharged to Red Bull by Red Bull Powertrains among others. The FIA concluded in Mexico that there was no accusation or evidence that Red Bull had sought at any time to act in bad faith dishonestly or in a fraudulent manner nor has it wilfully concealed any information from the Cost Cap Administration. Nevertheless the governing body has punished the 2021 runnerup with a 6m fine and a 10 cut in its aerodynamic testing allocation. It has 30 days to stick its cheque in the post. By way of a reaction team boss Christian Horner called it draconian fiercest rival Toto Wolff reckoned the punishment was about right and praised the FIA while McLarens boss Zak Brown was concerned it wasnt enough of a deterrent to prevent future breaches. Meanwhile Aston Martin will similarly have to cough up close to 390000 for its procedural infringements. The Silverstonebased concerned was found to have inaccurately excluded andor adjusted costs in relation to its shiny new headquarters wind tunnel and simulator. Hamilton intends on extending his Mercedes deal for a few more seasons and still feels great with the team Photo by Zak Mauger  Motorsport Images 8. Hamilton isnt planning on hanging up his helmet any time soon Strictly speaking we learned of Lewis Hamiltons intention to sign a contract extension to remain at Mercedes in an interview conducted in the United States. But that was kept under embargo until the F1 circus unpacked in Mexico so no one could talk about it then. Plus Hamiltons stance had been softening over recent races anyway. Nevertheless with the cat properly out of the bag in Mexico City the seventime champion was bombarded with questions and clarified that there was no immediate end date to his decorated topflight career. He said at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez Im not putting a limit on it to be honest. Im planning to do a multiyear deal with my team. I really really dont know what the next five years hold. I think were still trying to work on that. Theres a lot of great things that are being put in place like Ive just launched a film production company this week. But I feel great like in mind and body. I think theres more stuff to achieve together. I just dont know how long. Fernando Alonso reclaimed his seventh place from Austin after Haas initial protest was rescinded Photo by Zak Mauger  Motorsport Images 9. Alonso did score seventh in the United States GP after all First Fernando Alonso crossed the line to claim seventh place at Austin last time out. Next he was dropped to a pointless 15th after Haas successfully protested his Alpines flapping wing mirror to bring about a belated 30s penalty. Then on Thursday in Mexico the team successfully appealed the decision to leave the FIA to overturn the reprimand. In brief Alpine had rapidly issued a counterprotest for the penalty because Alonso had not been informed by race control that his car was unsafe to continue. It further argued that Haas had handed in its paperwork 24 minutes too late. The FIA ruled this protest to be inadmissible as the rules did not allow a protest to be lodged. Alpine though asked for a right of review on the grounds of bringing new and significant evidence. With the protest therefore admissible another hearing took place on Thursday night in Mexico where it was found that Haas could have lodged a handwritten protest within the 30minute deadline. This therefore meant the initial protest was not admissible making it null and void meaning that Alonso returns to seventh place as a result. Phew. Mexico will remain on the F1 calendar for at least another three seasons Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images 10. F1 will race in Mexico until the middle of the decade Rather than take a leaf out of Spas book  the circuit announced its oneyear extension for 2023 an hour before the Belgian GP which meant the news was totally lost amid the race buildup  the story broke in good time on Thursday that Formula 1 will keep returning to Mexico until 2025 at least. It was revealed that the championship and its owner Liberty Media had inked renewed terms with the Mexico City government and local promoter Corporacion Interamericana de Entretenimiento CIE for a further three years. Last weekends race marked F1s seventh visit to the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriquez of the modern era the venue having returned to the schedule in 2015 following a 22year layoff before the 2020 race was canned by COVID19. CIE president and CEO Alejandro Soberon said The ability to host the race in the nations capital until 2025 is the result of a coordinated effort to preserve an event that brings benefits to the city and excitement to thousands of fans. We will keep working to ensure the race continues to be a strong contributor to our citys economy. We sincerely hopes the deal leads to at least another three years of the mariachi cover of the F1 theme music being used. F1s popularity boom also continues to grow in Mexico Photo by Mark Sutton  Motorsport Images

Notably Red Bull and McLaren are first and second in DHLs ranking of the seasons fastest pit stops in which teams are awarded points on the same basis as the official F1 Championship standings. Red Bull are out in front with 501 points ahead of McLaren on 384 with Ferrari a long way back in third on 227 points.
Russell drove “too cautiously” in first lap F1 battle with Hamilton, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/russell-drove-too-cautiously-in-first-lap-f1-battle-with-hamilton/10393277/, Russell started second but after giving space to Hamilton he emerged from the opening sequence of corners on the first lap in fourth place a position he still held at the end of the race. I knew I wouldnt have been able to overtake Max Verstappen on the outside said Russell when asked by Autosport about his first lap. But having Lewis on the inside I didnt want to be too aggressive obviously him being my teammate. Id like to think it would have been the same had it been the other way around. So the soft should have been a medium the medium should have been the hard and the hard was like an ultra hard effectively., Russell started second but after giving space to Hamilton he emerged from the opening sequence of corners on the first lap in fourth place a position he still held at the end of the race. The Briton admitted that recent frustrations including his first corner collision with Carlos Sainz in Austin encouraged him to take a careful approach especially when battling with his teammate. I knew I wouldnt have been able to overtake Max Verstappen on the outside said Russell when asked by Autosport about his first lap. But having Lewis on the inside I didnt want to be too aggressive obviously him being my teammate. And ultimately that that cost me and caused me to lose two positions. So ultimately if I had managed to maintain position I probably would have finished second today. Asked if he would have given the same space to anyone other than his teammate Russell said Yeah I think it was more in Turn 1 to be honest I would have ordinarily just chopped across or in Turn 2 I would have run the driver wide. So yeah thats the way the game works sometimes. Id like to think it would have been the same had it been the other way around. Maybe maybe not Im not too sure. But Ive had a bit of a scrappy last three races on my behalf too many incidents too many mistakes. And that was probably a factor of taking it too cautiously. And theres a balance in there somewhere. George Russell Mercedes W13 Photo by Mark Sutton  Motorsport Images Russell admitted to some frustration about the strategy he ran in Mexico. Early in the race he indicated that he wanted to run long on his opening set of mediums and then switch to softs a choice used very successfully by Daniel Ricciardo. However not long after that message he mirrored Hamiltons strategy by going to hards. Lots of positives to take away from the weekend he said. It would have also been interesting to see how we performed had we started on the soft and gone to the medium or even if we extended the medium and went to the soft at the end. That was what I was pushing for in the car. Everythings easier in hindsight. Expanding on the strategy choice he said There was no real thought about starting on the soft but there was definitely a thought of extending the medium and going into the soft. Im not too sure I think we reacted to Nicholas Latifi and Lewis they both put the hard on and were setting green sectors everywhere. But the hard tyre just did not work from lap two onwards. I think generally this weekend Pirelli brought too hard a compound. So the soft should have been a medium the medium should have been the hard and the hard was like an ultra hard effectively. So seeing Ricciardos performance is a little bit disappointing as well because I really felt like I could have continued on that medium at a good pace and we would have been flying at the end on that soft. Russell made it clear on the radio that he wasnt happy with the hard tyres but there was nothing that the team could do. In the end he made a late extra stop just to secure fastest lap. I dont think there was so much frustration as such he said. Youre just trying to put your point across and when youre out there its physically demanding and theres a lot going on and youre struggling with the car and it may come across in that way. But I was trying to get my point across. I felt good on the medium. The pace was looking strong before Lewis pitted I was closing the gap. When I was in the lead I was setting personal bests. As I said its so easy in hindsight and perhaps we should have recognised that there was no way I would have been able to overtake Checo with the hard tyre and the only way would have been to put a soft.
Daniel Ricciardo calls for "maturity and respect" from Formula 1 paddock guests, https://www.planetf1.com/news/daniel-ricciardo-paddock-guests-respect/, After a number of drivers complained about the behaviour of some guests in the Mexican Grand Prix paddock Daniel Ricciardo has called for rules for those allowed into the inner circle. Pierre Gasly reported he felt mobbed by fans in the paddock and even had a stranger open his bag. I like having an atmosphere in the paddock I think it should be a fun place to be. Adults need to act like adults.Andreas Seidl warns against overreactionHowever Ricciardos team boss Andreas Seidl has warned against an overreaction. Im sure we will find solutions and we can keep enjoying this new atmosphere we have in the paddock throughout the world., After a number of drivers complained about the behaviour of some guests in the Mexican Grand Prix paddock Daniel Ricciardo has called for rules for those allowed into the inner circle. Formula 1 was racing at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez this past weekend Max Verstappen taking victory in what can only be described as an amphitheatre of excitement. Mexican fans are well known for the atmosphere they create but at times it was a bit too much. Pierre Gasly reported he felt mobbed by fans in the paddock and even had a stranger open his bag. Letting people in is fine but its true I feel like some guests sometimes are not really respecting the space we need he said. And people are coming into garages before qualifying and asking for pictures when they are not even from our team. We are working here and obviously we give time to the fans when we can. I know this weekend I didnt dare come out of the hospitality because otherwise you just know you will get mobbed. Sometimes it gets quite hectic because I arrived at the hospitality with my bag with my passport inside open and I didnt even feel it. Adults need to act like adults Ricciardos solution is for a set of guidelines to be written out and paddock guests to be made aware of the rules inside the paddock. While the Australian enjoys the atmosphere in the paddock he says there should be boundaries. To be honest this year has got more hectic he told The Race. I think there are two sides to it. The paddock used to lack atmosphere. I remember eight years ago 10 years ago the paddock was actually a pretty dull place. I like having an atmosphere in the paddock I think it should be a fun place to be. But there should also be boundaries. I think to be in the paddock and have a VIP pass its a privilege. And I think you also should act with some maturity and have respect. That hasnt always been shown this year. People lose their minds. If they set some guidelines maybe that helps because there isnt that at the moment. If its just a bit of awareness maybe they will be a little more cool. I dont want to see it change. Adults need to act like adults. Andreas Seidl warns against overreaction However Ricciardos team boss Andreas Seidl has warned against an overreaction. Formula 1 has often in the past been criticised for being out of reach for the fans the sport keeping its distance from the masses. Today under Liberty Media it is more accessible the owners trying to engage with fans wherever possible. The direction Formula 1 took is definitely the right one and a good one said the McLaren team principal. I appreciate a lot the atmosphere that is around now in the paddocks throughout the season. Here its clearly too extreme. And I think we just need to follow up and have a good discussion with Formula 1 how we can make sure that especially in countries like here in Mexico where the fans are also passionate for what we are doing and so enthusiastic we just always keep the right level of respect. Im sure we will find solutions and we can keep enjoying this new atmosphere we have in the paddock throughout the world.
Daniel Ricciardo “talking to teams” over F1 stay - George Russell opens door to Mercedes role | F1 | News, https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1016111/1/daniel-ricciardo-future-update-door-open-mercedes-role, The McLaren driver enjoyed a rare positive outing in 2022 at the F1 Mexico City Grand Prix finishing in P7 but has just two races remaining with his future unclear. Ricciardos contract with McLaren will be terminated a year early and he wont be in the F1 2023 driver lineup but has been linked to a reserve driver role at Mercedes.

Ricciardos contract with McLaren will be terminated a year early and he wont be in the F1 2023 driver lineup but has been linked to a reserve driver role at Mercedes. Daniel Ricciardo  WHERE NEXT  F1 2022 Video of Daniel Ricciardo  WHERE NEXT  F1 2022 Yeah it would be interesting Russell said to Sky about Ricciardo joining. Id like to see that. We have to see what he wants to do in the future. Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff had been spotted wearing Ricciardos merchandise but denied that it hinting towards a linkup. I am promoting his merch Honestly I just like it Wolff said. They took a photo of me and posted it online. Ricciardo teased I gave George a sweater. Toto messaged saying he really liked it so I gave him one too Vacant seats with Alpine Haas and Williams have passed without Ricciardo signing up. He said about his limited options If there was a lot Id probably be in a race seat. But there is enough to keep me interested. I want to stay active to some degree. Im aware that doing nothing for a year is not good. Ricciardo claimed I honestly dont know which team he will join in 2023 but the plan was to remain in F1 albeit not in a race seat. I am talking to teams he said. I still want to keep a foot in the door for 2024. Seeing the lights go out for race one I will have an itch Ricciardo sits 12th in the F1 standings after being comprehensively outperformed by teammate Lando Norris all year. He will be replaced by rookie Oscar Piastri next season. The last two years have been quite hard he admitted. You put a lot in and when it doesnt come back it can get you down. I know the value of a summer break. Stepping away can give you a different perspective. The season is pretty relentless you dont get a chance to rebuild. I truly believe it will be a blessing in disguise. I can confidently say that I wont be on the grid behind a wheel. But I still want to be in the sport working with a team. Still with the ambition to be back on the grid in 2024. Thats where my head is at. Time away from a race seat will do me good. Im not done. But it will look different.
'I felt fast but once again Car 14 stops' – Alonso frustrated after fifth DNF of the season in Mexico | Formula 1�, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.i-felt-fast-but-once-again-car-14-stops-alonso-frustrated-after-fifth-dnf-of.5DJ8dYBebtwT5Q05yxzDGg.html, Having seen strong points slip away on each occasion the Spaniard was left frustrated at the recurring reliability issues. Car 14 stops before the chequered flag so I think now we lost about 70 points Alonso said. Alonso frustrated after another failure I felt fast today but once again car 14 stopsWe are still happy with our strategy of pushing hard and having a car that performs. He did well to bring the car home in eighth place and score some valuable points for the team. Im confident we can rectify these issues going into the final two races of the season., The sight of Fernando Alonso punching the air in frustration alongside his stricken car is one that will stick out from the race in Mexico as his time with Alpine nears its end. Alonso was running a competitive seventh when he started to suffer from a loss of power and eventually had to retire his car at Turn 1 inside the final 10 laps to register his third retirement in five races. Having seen strong points slip away on each occasion the Spaniard was left frustrated at the recurring reliability issues. Car 14 stops before the chequered flag so I think now we lost about 70 points Alonso said. But its pointless to talk about this once more so lets see. Only two races to go and then a new chapter. MONDAY MORNING DEBRIEF How cunning strategy allowed us to see Ricciardo back at his best in Mexico I think Austin and Mexico have been the best races from a personal point of view. Pacewise I was like 20 seconds or something like that ahead of the McLarens and my team mate. I felt fast but once again Car 14 stops. Alonso was running in seventh before he stopped on track with an issue Team mate Ocon did gain a position as a result of Alonsos misfortune but then was unable to keep Daniel Ricciardo at bay late on. With a 10second time penalty hanging over the McLaren driver Ricciardo was able to pull enough of a gap to retain seventh place after his punishment was handed out leaving Ocon in eighth. I think we didnt put everything together but we fought hard the whole way Ocon said. Damage limitation I would call it. Obviously we lost Fernando we were supposed to have a doublepoints finish. READ MORE Verstappen makes F1 history as he beats Hamilton to victory in Mexico for 14th win of the season I was managing the cooling issue we were having a lot and thats mainly why we lost to Daniel. Happy for him on one side but not happy on the other side because we lost out as a team. So damage limitation well keep fighting in the last two rounds. Reliability has arguably been Alpines biggest weakness this season but Ocon is comfortable with the tradeoff of chasing performance first and foremost. Alonso frustrated after another failure I felt fast today but once again car 14 stops We are still happy with our strategy of pushing hard and having a car that performs. The pace was good when we didnt have to manage so much so it was solid in that regard. Its a stance echoed by Team Principal Otmar Szafnauer who was unhappy at losing Alonso late on but believes Alpine can find fixes for their problems ahead of the penultimate round in Brazil. FACTS AND STATS Verstappen sets new season records for points and wins Unfortunately Fernando suffered a cylinder failure on Lap 52 and he was having to manage on five cylinders  meaning a significant lack of power  to try and remain inside the points Szafnauer said. Eventually the problem was not sustainable and he had to retire the car. Esteban faced a challenge with some cooling issues from quite early on in the race where he had to liftandcoast and therefore he sacrificed significant lap time. He did well to bring the car home in eighth place and score some valuable points for the team. We know reliability is going to be the key in our championship battle and its something that has let us down after showing such a strong level of performance in recent races. Im confident we can rectify these issues going into the final two races of the season.
Alonso feels Alpine is "unprepared" after Mexico F1 reliability woes, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/alonso-feels-alpine-is-unprepared-after-latest-reliability-woe-in-mexico/10393322/, Speaking in the media pen after the race Alonso noted that for car 14 there are always reliability issues referring to his Alpine and said he thought his race had been exceptional up to that point. Fernando Alonso Alpine F1 Team Photo by Zak Mauger  Motorsport ImagesHe added The engine cannot finish the races. The retirement in Mexico marked the fifth time this season Alonso has failed to see the chequered flag. The Spaniard sits 11 points behind Alpine teammate Esteban Ocon in the standings after the Frenchman finished eighth in Mexico. Alonso has just two races remaining with Alpine in F1 before he makes the switch to Aston Martin for the 2023 season., Alonso had been in contention for a points finish at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez only to suffer a cylinder failure while running seventh before an eventual loss of power forced him to retire from the race with six laps remaining. It came as the latest reliability setback for Alonso in what has been a frustrating season that has seen him regularly lament points lost through no fault of his own claiming to have lost more than 60 points over the season. Speaking in the media pen after the race Alonso noted that for car 14 there are always reliability issues referring to his Alpine and said he thought his race had been exceptional up to that point. Its just amazing that only one or two cars retire at every race and there is always car 14 said Alonso. I blew up five engines this year I think. The problem in the qualifying in Australia in Austria I didnt even start the race because of the blackout. So I think in 19 races more or less 50 of the races we havent scored the points we deserve. But theres nothing we can do now. Asked if he thought it was simply a case of bad luck for him Alonso replied No I think we are unprepared. Fernando Alonso Alpine F1 Team Photo by Zak Mauger  Motorsport Images He added The engine cannot finish the races. It cannot be bad luck when you have to change six or seven engines as we did and still not finishing races. I think they have some job to do over the winter hopefully not too much. Renault placed a big emphasis on gaining more performance with the engine for its works F1 team over the winter having long lagged behind rivals Mercedes Ferrari and Honda. While the French manufacturer has made big gains on that front this year it has also suffered more reliability issues  something Alpine technical chief Pat Fry said was a result of a courageous development push. The retirement in Mexico marked the fifth time this season Alonso has failed to see the chequered flag. The Spaniard sits 11 points behind Alpine teammate Esteban Ocon in the standings after the Frenchman finished eighth in Mexico. My level is very high at this point of the season and the standings at the end of the year will be one of the lowest Alonso said. Its a little bit frustrating but theres nothing I can do. Alonso has just two races remaining with Alpine in F1 before he makes the switch to Aston Martin for the 2023 season.
Ricciardo "didn't plan" to overtake Tsunoda ahead of Mexico F1 clash, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/ricciardo-didnt-plan-to-overtake-tsunoda-ahead-of-mexico-f1-clash/10393312/, Tsunoda driver made it back to the pits but he was forced to retire due to damage incurred. Ricciardo said he wouldnt take full blame for the earlier incident suggesting that Tsunoda could have left him more room. I didnt lock I stayed on the apex truth is I didnt actually plan or want to overtake him there. I mean of course Id love to overtake him I wasnt set into that corner to like outbrake him and overtake him. At that point I didnt really care he said., Listen to this article The pair made contact when Ricciardo made a move on the inside of a tight righthander as they battled for 11th position on the 51st lap. Tsunoda driver made it back to the pits but he was forced to retire due to damage incurred. Ricciardo was soon handed a 10second penalty by the FIA stewards. However his recovery was helped by him being one of the few drivers to switch to soft tyres for the last part of the race. Against the odds he moved up to seventh place by the flag and was far enough ahead of Esteban Ocon that the effect of the penalty was negated. Ricciardo said he wouldnt take full blame for the earlier incident suggesting that Tsunoda could have left him more room. Ive seen a few replays he said. I mean Ill take more of the responsibility but certainly I dont feel it was 100 to zero in terms of my fault. I didnt lock I stayed on the apex truth is I didnt actually plan or want to overtake him there. I mean of course Id love to overtake him I wasnt set into that corner to like outbrake him and overtake him. I just thought if I stay there Its nothing that you probably dont know but all the grips on the inside of that corner. Its very dusty. So I thought if I could just stay there keep him a bit on the dirty line Ill get a better exit. Look we probably needed to give each other 2030 more centimetres and were fine. Probably not even that. I wish it didnt happen and Im sorry that it happened but I think 10 seconds was more than enough and somehow we kind of still came through. Ricciardo admitted that he expected a penalty. Yeah I figured they probably had to do something. But I also its so hard when youre in the heat of battle but I didnt remember locking. With Carlos Sainz in Imola Turn 1 when I went off the apex and slid into him. It didnt feel like that. So I was going to come on the radio and vent a little but I just chose to say nothing. I went pretty dark and then just decided to keep pushing and try to make up for it. Ricciardo said he felt really comfortable once he was on the soft tyre. At that point I didnt really care he said. Because I didnt have that much to lose and as soon as I got out the pits the tyre was like so much better. I could lean on it and I felt like I was in control. So I was like lets just use this tyre see what its got. And then it stayed relatively consistent. So I kind of pushed really hard then just tried to manage it and it was still giving me a lot more pace. Ricciardo also revealed that George Russell might have cost him a position by dropping him within 10 seconds on the pursuing Ocon but a late pit stop by the Mercedes driver saved him. The last few laps I was pretty nervous because George was so close to getting a blue flag for me. And I knew I would lose a couple of seconds with that. And that would have dropped me back into Ocon. So I was pushing like hell just to try and hold that twosecond gap. And then when I heard he pitted for fastest lap  he probably doesnt think it or know it but Ill buy him a beer anyways
Record-breaking Max Verstappen already an F1 great at 25, https://www.espn.com/f1/story/_/id/34916572/record-breaking-max-verstappen-already-f1-great-25, For the now double world champion Max Verstappen his first season of total dominance has come at the relatively young age of 25. With two races remaining in 2022 there is every chance Verstappen raises the bar to 16. More impressively he has won races from lowly grid positions which was rarely the case for the other Vettel and Schumacher. Vettel won all of his 13 races in 2013 from the front row of the grid while Schumacher won 11 of his 13 from the first two grid positions. Like him or not Verstappens performance this year has been truly exceptional., MEXICO CITY  Dominance by a single driver is common in Formula One but that doesnt mean its easy to attain. Many of the greats have enjoyed a season  or multiple seasons  of unbeatable form but the ease with which the victories fall always belies the hard work with which they were achieved. For the now double world champion Max Verstappen his first season of total dominance has come at the relatively young age of 25. By winning the Mexican Grand Prix on Sunday his 14th of the year Verstappen set a new record for race victories in a single season. The previous record of 13 was set in 2004 by Michael Schumacher during his dominant Ferrari years and equaled in 2013 by Sebastian Vettel while driving for Red Bull. With two races remaining in 2022 there is every chance Verstappen raises the bar to 16. Not that the man himself is interested in the numbers. I was never really interested in stats Verstappen said after securing his victory in Mexico. I just live in the moment try to do the best I can every single weekend. I try to win the races  that for me is the most important thing that when I go home I can say to myself that I maximized the performance and if Im close to that Im happy. But a lot in Formula One depends on the whole package and we have a great package right now. Im just enjoying the moment and Im not that interested in keeping in touch with every stat. But of course it has been an amazing season and of course I am very happy winning so many races. Max Verstappen has been almost unbeatable in 2022. Chris GraythenGetty Images As Verstappen has pointed out before comparing records across eras in Formula One is fraught with inconsistencies. Schumacher achieved his 13 wins in an 18race season Vettel scored his in a 19race season and Verstappen secured his first 13 wins of 2022 in 20 race period before taking No. 14 at the 21st race of the year. But while Verstappens season may be statistically less impressive with two races left to run he has arguably had a less dominant car than Schumacher and Vettel enjoyed in their record years. Whats more he has secured a number of his 14 wins in a more spectacular fashion. While the Red Bull is clearly the class of the field at this stage of the season Ferrari was a genuine threat for victories at every race in the early rounds of 2022. Looking at it one way you could argue the Italian team has gifted Verstappen additional wins  most notably in Spain when Charles Leclerc broke down and then in France when Leclerc crashed out of the lead  but the counter argument is that Verstappen has consistently been in a position to take advantage. More impressively he has won races from lowly grid positions which was rarely the case for the other Vettel and Schumacher. Vettel won all of his 13 races in 2013 from the front row of the grid while Schumacher won 11 of his 13 from the first two grid positions. Verstappen however has won six of his 14 from grid positions outside the top two and two of those were from way back in 10th and 14th on the grid in Hungary and Belgium. At a glance that could reflect negatively on his qualifying performance but his three lowliest grid positions that led to victories were all at races where he had either grid penalties for engine component changes Italy and Belgium or a power unit issue in qualifying Hungary. On top of that Ferrari has had a quicker car in qualifying at a number of races this year which was not the case among Vettels and Schumachers rivals when they were dominating. It means Verstappen has had to fight harder for the front row starting positions he has earned and to underline that point a surprising statistic from this year is that Leclerc has a higher average starting position 2.65 than Verstappens 2.70 while also securing nine poles to Verstappens seven. Again the comparison between eras is far from perfect but there is no doubt Verstappen has already put himself among the sports greatest drivers with many fruitful years of his career still to run. His team boss Christian Horner who is in a position to directly compare the newlycrowned twotime champion with fourtime champion Vettel gave a valid perspective on the two on Sunday night. They are two very different drivers two phenomenally successful drivers and I think what Sebastian has achieved in his career puts him among the greats and the most successful drivers in the sport he said on Sunday evening in Mexico. But I think Max what we are seeing today and this year we are actually witnessing something very special. I sometimes think that his achievements perhaps dont receive the plaudits that they should because what we have witnessed this year is an absolutely outstanding performance from a driver who is at the top of his game. Asked if Verstappens was the most impressive seasonlong performance from a driver Horner has seen he added Theres been years of domination with Mercedes but I think as an individual driver probably yes. He has won the most grands prix in a year now within 21 races. On top of that he has won two sprint races and he has not won all of them from pole position. Hes had to fight and race for a lot of those victories. When we look back at the end of the year it is an absolutely outstanding year that Max has driven. He hasnt put a wheel wrong. He has been perfect throughout the season and its incredible the level of consistency he has been able to achieve. Of course thats the opinion of a very proud team boss with a naturally biased viewpoint but even if Verstappen retired tomorrow it would be hard to deny his position among the top drivers in F1 history after this years performance. There will be some that point to Red Bulls breach of last years cost cap as a reason to diminish Verstappens achievement in 2022. But even the most exaggerated claims of how much performance Red Bull gained in the development of this years car by overspending last year would fall short of cancelling out his advantage over the rest of the field. Like him or not Verstappens performance this year has been truly exceptional.

Gasly wants talks with stewards after nearing F1 race ban in Mexico GP, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/gasly-close-to-one-race-f1-ban-after-reaching-10-penalty-points/10393267/, Gasly has become increasingly frustrated with officialdom in recent weeks having been penalised for speeding under the red flag at the Japanese GP and for leaving too big a gap behind the safety car in Austin. He raised the matter of the harshness of the penalty points system in Fridays drivers briefing prior to the Mexican GP. Last weekend half the grid was giving too much space behind the safety car and I was penalised. At the end of the day I try my best inside the car and the last thing I want is to get stupid penalty points and lose race time. It was not just the penalty points because obviously Im quite close to being banned for a race he said when asked by Autosport about the briefing debate., The point took his running 12month total up to 10 just two short of the figure that automatically triggers a suspension for one event. His first points were logged in the Spanish GP on 22 May  which means under the current rules he wont lose any from his total until after next years Emilia Romagna GP the seventh round of the 2023 championship. Gasly has become increasingly frustrated with officialdom in recent weeks having been penalised for speeding under the red flag at the Japanese GP and for leaving too big a gap behind the safety car in Austin. He raised the matter of the harshness of the penalty points system in Fridays drivers briefing prior to the Mexican GP. He subsequently picked up a further point in Sundays race after being deemed to have left the track and gained an advantage when battling with Lance Stroll. He received a fivesecond penalty as well as the point. Gasly was clearly frustrated after the Mexican race having fallen foul of the FIA yet again and after learning about the penalty point he even took a moment to gather his thoughts before speaking to the media. He was particularly frustrated that he wasnt told to give the position back to Stroll. Im a racing driver and if I see a gap I will go for the gap he said when asked about the Stroll incident by Autosport. And if you are not happy about it tell me to give the position back and then I will try again. I wasnt given any comments so that is a shame. He added They just need to say it on the radio and that is what they have done in the past but for some reason not this time. Pierre Gasly AlphaTauri AT03 Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images Asked if he had to change his approach Gasly said he will speak to officials at the next race in Brazil. They the stewards seem to be quite harsh lately he said. Last weekend half the grid was giving too much space behind the safety car and I was penalised. This weekend I think it was quite tight and I dont know why I wasnt really given a message to give the position back. At the end of the day I try my best inside the car and the last thing I want is to get stupid penalty points and lose race time. Apparently at the moment they are not happy with what Im doing so I will have a discussion to understand exactly what I have got to change. Earlier in the weekend Gasly indicated that the discussion he initiated in Fridays drivers briefing discussion about penalties had been a positive one even suggesting that the points system may be adjusted by the FIA  possibly in time to save him from a race ban in 2023. It was not just the penalty points because obviously Im quite close to being banned for a race he said when asked by Autosport about the briefing debate. But in my opinion I dont feel like Ive been that dangerous over the last 12 months and it would be a shame to get a race ban for slowing down a bit too much behind the safety car and a couple of track limits this year. So I think theyre working on it and probably for next year there are going to be changes. Thats good to hear. Gaslys 2022 penalty points Spain Causing a collision Lance Stroll  2 points Austria Causing a collision Sebastian Vettel  2 points Austria Leaving the track without justification multiple times  1 point Japan Speeding under red flag conditions  2 points USA Car fell more than 10 lengths behind the safety car  2 points Mexico Leaving the track and gaining an advantage Lance Stroll  1 point On 10 October Gasly lost two penalty points earned for causing a collision with Fernando Alonso at the 2021 Turkish GP. This year he also received two reprimands for bollard offences in Canada.
Red Bull boycott Sky Sports after reporter said Lewis Hamilton was 'robbed' of F1 title, https://inews.co.uk/sport/formula-one/red-bull-boycotts-sky-sports-ted-kravitz-lewis-hamilton-robbed-f1-title-1943825, Max Verstappen accused Sky Sports of being disrespectful and living in the past after Red Bull boycotted the broadcaster at the Mexican Grand Prix. Verstappen and his entire Red Bull team  including Christian Horner  refused to address Sky on Sunday. Their unprecedented stance came a week after Sky Sports pitlane reporter Ted Kravitz said Lewis Hamilton was last year robbed of an eighth world championship. It is understood Red Bull have grown increasingly frustrated with Skys coverage since the contentious Abu Dhabi finale. Initially Red Bull said the boycott would be indefinite but Horner indicated on Sunday night that their silence would end at the following round in Brazil on 13 November., Max Verstappen accused Sky Sports of being disrespectful and living in the past after Red Bull boycotted the broadcaster at the Mexican Grand Prix. Verstappen and his entire Red Bull team  including Christian Horner  refused to address Sky on Sunday. Their unprecedented stance came a week after Sky Sports pitlane reporter Ted Kravitz said Lewis Hamilton was last year robbed of an eighth world championship. It is understood Red Bull have grown increasingly frustrated with Skys coverage since the contentious Abu Dhabi finale. Sky Sports declined to comment. Confronting the subject after he won for a recordbreaking 14th time in one season on Sunday Verstappen said It had nothing to do with this weekend but this year. It has been a constant kind of digging and being disrespectful especially from one particular person. At one point it is enough and I dont accept it. You cannot live in the past and you have to move on. Social media is a very toxic place and if you are constantly being like that live on TV then you are making it worse instead of trying to make it better. You keep disrespecting me and at one point I will not tolerate it any more and that is why I decided to stop answering. Hamilton finished runnerup to Verstappen at last weekends United States Grand Prix in Austin after he was passed by the Red Bull driver with six laps remaining. Following the race Kravitz said Hamilton doesnt win a race all year and then finally comes back at a track where he could win the first race battling the same guy who won the race he was robbed in the previous year and manages to finish ahead of him. What a script and a story that would have been. But thats not the way the script turned out today was it Because the guy that beat him after being robbed actually overtook him because hes got a quicker car because of engineering and Formula One and design and pretty much because of Adrian Newey Red Bull technical chief over there. Verstappen claimed his maiden world championship after race director Michael Masi incorrectly applied the safety car rules in the closing laps of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Although Masi was removed from his position an FIA investigation said the Australian acted in good faith but made a human error. Initially Red Bull said the boycott would be indefinite but Horner indicated on Sunday night that their silence would end at the following round in Brazil on 13 November. There were some derogatory comments made so we took a break from Sky for this race he said. Max was upset. We were upset and we made the decision to stand together as a team. It wont have done Sky any harm for us to lay down a marker. Some of the commentary is fair but some pieces are sensationalist and saying we robbed anyone of the championship as was said in Austin is going too far. It is not impartial or fair or balanced. We have said our piece and will go back to normal next time. Earlier this month F1 bosses signed off a new deal with Sky which will mean the broadcaster retains exclusive UK television rights until the end of the 2029 season. Press Association

Mercedes unsure Ricciardo's F1 strategy would have changed Mexican GP result, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/mercedes-unsure-ricciardos-f1-strategy-would-have-changed-mexico-result/10393217/, Verstappen scored his 14th win of the season for Red Bull but was kept honest by Lewis Hamilton through the opening stint as Mercedes opted for a different starting tyre. While Red Bull fitted softs to both Verstappen and Sergio Perezs cars from the start Mercedes went for mediums with Hamilton and George Russell favouring a onestop strategy. Hamilton kept within two seconds of Verstappen through the opening stint before taking the lead when the Red Bull pitted stretching out his mediums to last 29 laps. Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff said after the race it was always easier to judge with hindsight but explained that the teams prerace data suggested it had gone for the right strategy. We experimented with a lot of things the engine guys have pushed the boundaries really to give us the maximum performance also., Verstappen scored his 14th win of the season for Red Bull but was kept honest by Lewis Hamilton through the opening stint as Mercedes opted for a different starting tyre. While Red Bull fitted softs to both Verstappen and Sergio Perezs cars from the start Mercedes went for mediums with Hamilton and George Russell favouring a onestop strategy. Hamilton kept within two seconds of Verstappen through the opening stint before taking the lead when the Red Bull pitted stretching out his mediums to last 29 laps. But when Hamilton switched to hard tyres the seventime world champion said he was not feeling as comfortable allowing Verstappen to extend his lead and ultimately avoid a second pitstop en route to victory ahead of the Mercedes. Russell asked Mercedes at one point during the race to go for softs in the final stint only to be told it would have required a long mediumtyre stint. That approach was successfully taken by Ricciardo and McLaren who pitted on lap 44 to switch from mediums to softs before going on a late charge that led him to seventh even after a 10second penalty was applied for a clash with Yuki Tsunoda. Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff said after the race it was always easier to judge with hindsight but explained that the teams prerace data suggested it had gone for the right strategy. I think the onestop mediumhard looked like the right strategy said Wolff. That the medium held on for so long at the end came as a surprise. But hindsight is the thing. If we were to restart the race maybe we would choose a different tyre. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes W13 Sergio Perez Red Bull Racing RB18 Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images Wolff said Mercedes could have decided to lose more time on the medium and hang it out there for another five or six laps and then try to do 30 laps on the soft like Ricciardo did but he felt it was not a given that it would hold on to the end of the race. Both Hamilton and Russells race engineers were heard during the race telling their drivers that the Red Bulls mediums were expected to drop off in pace only for them to last longer than expected and for them to finish behind Verstappen and Perez. Wolff said Mercedes had discussed using on softs in the race and felt the tyre was strong but not strong enough to go 30 laps or so. Asked by Autosport if he thought the mediumsoft strategy would have been enough to beat Red Bull today Wolff replied I dont think we could have overtaken them because with the gaps that would have been basically the reverse strategy. Even the softmedium that would have been a bit of an advantage into Turn 1. Lewis was on the outside so you never know how it would have come. But we would have been even closer on a different strategy. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes W13 in the pits Photo by Steven Tee  Motorsport Images Mercedes comfortably ran as the secondfastest team ahead of Ferrari in Mexico aided by the high altitude that meant it did not struggle with drag as much as at other tracks as well as benefitting from its high downforce strength. The team now has just two more chances to end its winless campaign but Wolff said the simulations suggested Mexico had been its best chance. On the simulations it says yes he said. But we see the tendency we see that we are able to compete. Im really proud of the team of what we did this weekend. We experimented with a lot of things the engine guys have pushed the boundaries really to give us the maximum performance also. I think it will be a mix between trying the max while trying the most for next year.
Alonso set for maiden Aston Martin F1 test in Abu Dhabi, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/alonso-maiden-aston-martin-test-abu-dhabi/10393193/, Listen to this articleThe test to be held on the Tuesday following the final race of the season will feature two cars per team. Race drivers will run the definitive 2023 Pirelli tyres in one car and rookies will drive the other. Traditionally the Abu Dhabi running sees drivers who are moving teams for the following year gain their first experience with their new outfits assuming that they have been able to negotiate a release from their previous teams. Meanwhile Felipe Drugovich is due to drive last years Aston Martin AMR21 on the full Silverstone circuit on Tuesday the same car having recently been used by Zak OSullivan for his Aston Martin Autosport BRDC Young Driver of the Year Award run.

Race drivers will run the definitive 2023 Pirelli tyres in one car and rookies will drive the other. Traditionally the Abu Dhabi running sees drivers who are moving teams for the following year gain their first experience with their new outfits assuming that they have been able to negotiate a release from their previous teams. Often part of the arrangement is that they appear in neutral or unbranded overalls. AlphaTauri boss Franz Tost revealed in Mexico on Friday that Nyck de Vries will drive for his team while Pierre Gasly is expected to make is first appearance for Alpine as part of the bigger deal that released him from the Red Bull camp for 2023. However Oscar Piastri has not yet been released by Alpine to drive for McLaren. The Enstone teams boss Otmar Szafnauer noted in Mexico I think our legal teams are discussing that now. And I dont know. Therell be more next week so ask me in Brazil. Its understood that Alonso had to gain permission himself for his release from Alpine with no direct involvement from Aston Martin and that he has been able to do so. Asked by Motorsport.com if he had cards in his hand that helped him to gain that release Alonso smiled and said Im always in charge of my own destiny Sebastian Vettel Aston Martin AMR22 Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images Alonso is expected to run half a day of tyre testing in Abu Dhabi with his new teammate Lance Stroll doing the other half. The Spaniard will be able to log further mileage with the AMR22 in Pirelli tyre testing in February prior to the launch of the new car and the sole official test session in Bahrain a week prior to the first race of the season. Meanwhile Felipe Drugovich is due to drive last years Aston Martin AMR21 on the full Silverstone circuit on Tuesday the same car having recently been used by Zak OSullivan for his Aston Martin Autosport BRDC Young Driver of the Year Award run. As well as being the first big step in Drugovichs development programme with the team it will be an important day for the Brazilian as he will have to complete 300kms in order to qualify to take part in FP1 at the Abu Dhabi GP. If he fails to do so for any reason the team will have to find someone else to do the FP1 session with De Vries the obvious candidate. Drugovich will however still be able to do the young driver test that follows the race weekend Aston Martin Ambassador Jess Hawkins is also scheduled to do some laps in the AMR21 on Tuesday after Drugovich has run. In other rookie driver news Liam Lawson is expected to replace Max Verstappen at Red Bull in FP1 in Abu Dhabi the Kiwi having already done two sessions for AlphaTauri.

In part he blames UK broadcaster Sky Sports pitlane reporter Ted Kravitz for a series of comments made live on television.

Max Verstappen broke all time records on Sunday whilst admitting that he is boycotting the Formula 1 broadcaster Sky. We are definitely enjoying it and well try to go for more said the backtoback world champion after breaking Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettels alltime record for the number of wins now 14 in a single season. In Mexico he also raced past Lewis Hamiltons record now 416 for the number of points scored in a season. But while the Dutchman and Red Bull are enjoying unprecedented success Verstappen says the environment on social media has become toxic. In part he blames UK broadcaster Sky Sports pitlane reporter Ted Kravitz for a series of comments made live on television. Kravitz said Verstappen 25 doesnt seem to be a driver capable of winning a championship in a normal way and says Hamilton  who he has called an eight time champion  was robbed of the 2021 title. He Verstappen has got a quicker car because of engineering and Formula 1 and design and pretty much because of him Adrian Newey over there Kravitz also said. As the course of the Mexican GP weekend progressed it became clear not only that Verstappen was refusing to talk to Sky UK Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland but that Red Bull as a whole team was following suit. Verstappen confirmed the boycott. This year its been a constant kind of like digging being disrespectful especially one particular person he said. And at one point its enough you know I dont accept it. At the moment social media is a very toxic place. And if you are constantly being like that live on TV you make it only worse instead of trying to make it better in the world. You keep disrespecting me and one point Im not tolerating it anymore. Thats why I decided to stop answering Verstappen added. His boss Christian Horner backed his driver and confirmed that Red Bull had also boycotted the Sky broadcasters over the Mexican GP weekend. Were disappointed with a series of derogatory comments that have been made on Sky so we felt this weekend we would take a break he said. There needs to be balance in commentary. Some of the commentary is excellent but some of the pieces there is too much sensationalism being done. Max was very upset about it and as a team we support him fully.
FIA post-race press conference - Mexico City, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.fia-post-race-press-conference-mexico-city-2022.7jLyhzROnX4I8Tmn6n1odT.html, I was so close I think in that first stint but I think the Red Bull was just clearly too fast today and ultimately maybe they had the better tyre strategy. I really really pushed hard. MV Yeah I mean another great race I think. So yeah another great race but also its just an incredible season for us as a team. So ultimately I think they were on the right tyre strategy., DRIVERS 1  Max VERSTAPPEN Red Bull Racing 2  Lewis HAMILTON Mercedes 3  Sergio PREZ Red Bull Racing PARC FERM INTERVIEWS Conducted by Marc Gen Q Hello everybody. Hola todos. Max Verstappen you are unstoppable. Tell me first on the race which was the key point because everybody spoke about the start. And you did great. You know do you think that was a very important key to win that race Max VERSTAPPEN Yeah of course that helped me out a lot for the rest of the race to stay in the lead after Turn 1. Of course we were also on a different strategy to the cars around us. But yeah again an incredible result. The pace of the car was again really nice. We had to look after our tyres because it was a very long stint on the medium but we made it work. Q Youve been to many many podiums but have you ever seen something like that with such a big crowd MV Its amazing. Its an incredible atmosphere and we love to come here. Q And finally Max. I dont know how much you look into numbers or how much you are into history. World Champion and now you are the first driver ever to win 14 grands prix in one season. How do you feel about that MV Yeah its been an incredible year so far. So yeah we are definitely enjoying it and well try to go for more. Q Well done. Enjoy. Lewis Hamilton second place. You were pushing all the way. You were pushing Max at the beginning of the race. Did you think at some point that you could win the race Lewis HAMILTON Yeah well first this has been an amazing crowd and definitely a bit awkward this time rounds boos all day but nonetheless I have so much love for Mexico and for the people here and what a great race and event they have put on this weekend. I was so close I think in that first stint but I think the Red Bull was just clearly too fast today and ultimately maybe they had the better tyre strategy. Q About the tyres and the strategy you tried the Hard compound we could hear you on the radio that it was difficult. What was the problem Do you think the Hard was not the right tyre at that moment of the race LH Yeah not sure it was the right tyre the end. I thought we should have started on the Soft but obviously we had the opposite tyre. It was OK in the first stint but that Hard was just offset so congratulations to Max and its great to be up here and separate the two. Q Still well done you kept the pressure on Checo so well done for that second place. And now Checo. Well done. What do you feel What are your emotions What are your emotions to be in front of 70000 Mexicans here in the Foro Sol Sergio PREZ Yeah I mean I gave my best you know today at the start. I really really pushed hard. Unfortunately we had a little bit of a bad stop which prevented us to undercut Lewis. Overtaking is so difficult. As soon as I got behind him it was really difficult to follow so I had to stay in third. Q But still I think a key point was the start when you overtook Russell to be on the podium. Do you think that was very important in Turn 4 SP Yeah definitely. You know given how difficult overtaking was today I think that it was key you know. I thought we were going to be a little closer but unfortunately it didnt work out for us today but still its good a good podium in front of this crowd. I really wanted more today but third place its still a good. PRESS CONFERENCE Q Well done Max that was a brilliantly controlled race and one that sees you take the record of 14 wins in a season. Another incredible milestone in an extraordinary season. MV Yeah I mean another great race I think. We knew that the first stint was going to be the crucial one for us to keep that Soft tyre alive long enough which seemed to work. I mean I did struggle a bit towards the end but luckily the gap was big enough to extend a few laps. And yeah once we put on the Medium tyres everything was working quite well. And I think quite early on we figured that we could make it to the end. So yeah another great race but also its just an incredible season for us as a team. Never thought I would be able to win 14 races in a year. But yeah of course Im incredibly proud. Q Can I throw another stat at you With 416 points youve also broken the record for the number of points scored in a single season. How high can you go MV I mean we have a sprint race in Brazil and laughs Hopefully we can score a few more but I mean its not about that. At the end of the day its all about trying to win a championship and it doesnt matter with how many points you do it but it does show that we are having an incredible year. Q Can we talk a little bit more about strategy Did you consider the Hard tyre at that pit stop MV No. I tried it in FP1 and it just didnt really feel great. So I think thats why we never really wanted to use it. Q You seemed to be managing a fair bit during the race not just looking after the tyres. We heard you talking about bouncing. We also heard you comment on the gearshifts. Just how many issues were there MV No no real issues. Its just that the kerbs here are quite aggressive and I was trying a few different lines and some worked and some didnt. And with the gears I think it was just after the pit stop I think the clutch was a bit warm. And after that it was OK. Q A final word on the podium. We can hear the music in the background now just how special is it here in the Foro Sol MV Yeah I mean they put on a great show. I mean the atmosphere in general is incredible. The fans are super passionate about Formula 1 but of course about Checo. But it also helps a lot You know you have that whole stadium and it makes it look incredible. Its a great atmosphere. Q Max many thanks and many congratulations as well. Lewis were coming to you now. Great job. Your second second place in as many weeks although you didnt seem totally happy with your strategy after the race. What would you change if you ran the race again LH Well firstly Im really happy to be up here and to be able to split the Red Bulls I think is a huge result for us. Brought an upgrade into the last race and to have kindof close the gap a little bit  they still have the edge I think  but I dont know I think it was amazing for us to be fighting in qualifying and have the second and third. I was speaking about in strategy about us taking a risk with one of the cars at least doing something different. I had a gut feeling that they will be on the Soft to start with and when everyone took their blankets off everyone around us was on the Softs and were on the Mediums. At that moment. I thought that we may be in trouble. But then again its a long long race so I thought maybe theyll be on a twostop. But that Medium tyre just had no dropoff. So ultimately I think they were on the right tyre strategy. But I am grateful I was able to just about keep up within that first stint. Thats huge to be able to keep up with a Red Bull. Q You said during the race that you werent happy with the Hard tyre. Did you consider going longer on the Medium and then going straight to Soft LH I mean I kept telling them the tyre was fine but Im assuming that they were coming into my window. Sergio had already stopped. So Im assuming they they were going much quicker than me perhaps. So if we stayed out longer I would have come out behind Sergio and it would have been all over. So I think thats the reason. Unfortunately at the beginning obviously had a good battle through Turns 1 and 2 but obviously my teammate got jumped by Sergio so I was basically tagteamed by the Red Bulls. Its very very hard in strategy when you dont have both cars there. I think Sergio was able to come in and pull me in which definitely hindered our strategy. Q Were talking a lot about strategy  but what positives do you take from this weekend I mean was this the most competitive the car has been this year LH Yeah its so so many positives to take from this weekend. And yeah this is definitely the most competitive and the best the car has felt all year  and that is truly down to the amazing work from all the women and men back at the factory who have just been doing such an amazing job. And not giving up. I think its just been a real showing of resilience and perseverance. And Im so happy to be kindof back in that fight. We saw in the last race kindof almost having a chance to win. And I dont know what the car will be like in these next races. Im hoping in Brazil something special may come of it. But well see. Q Checo coming to you now. Another third place for you at home. How sweet was the podium this time SP It was always very sweet. Unfortunately I think today we could have been a bit higher you know we had a better stop. But at the end I think second or third doesnt really matter. As long as Im on the podium. It was great to have all these people. They have been amazing the whole weekend. And it was just nice to finish off the weekend with a podium. Q Lets go through the race in chronological order. Can you describe the opening few corners How crucial was it for you to pass George Russell at that point SP Yeah it was quite important to make some progress on lap one. So I managed to get George early on and then just stay with Max and Lewis throughout that first stint. And we boxed relatively early for the Medium which was going to be an undercut on Lewis but unfortunately we had a bad stop. And we just came behind the Ferraris a bit too far and that meant that we were just we lost too much time going through them. So yeah that was I think what really prevented us getting Lewis because I could see he was struggling in the early laps with the Hard tyre and that was our opportunity. Once you get them going he seemed to pull away a bit. And yeah unfortunately there was not much I could do because every time I was getting close to him things were overheating brakes engine tyres so I have very few chances to attack him. I use a few times ERS but no more than that. Q And youve retaken second place in the Drivers Championship five points ahead of Charles Leclerc. Do you feel youve got the momentum in that battle now SP It can change racetorace. For now I just want to go into the next two and aim for the win. Theres nothing more to lose so we will try everything. Its been a very difficult weekend with far too many issues so we need to put everything together and then I believe we can do the next step.

The 25yearolds 14th victory of the season sees him pass Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel for the most race wins in a single season in Formula One history. Earlier in October Verstappen claimed his second career world championship at the Japanese Grand Prix and last week he won the US Grand Prix in Austin Texas which saw him share the record for number of season race wins. With his victory in Mexico Verstappen also broke the record for the most points accumulated in a single season previously set by Lewis Hamilton in 2019. The records confirm Verstappens dominance this season. After an inauspicious start in Bahrain back in March he has won race after race comfortably seeing off an early challenge from Ferraris Charles Leclerc. Speaking after Sundays race at Autodromo Hermanos Rodrguez in Mexico City Mexico Verstappen looked forward to more success. An incredible result. Its been an incredible year so far. Were definitely enjoying it and well try to go for more the Dutch driver said. Seventime world champion Lewis Hamilton finished in second place some 15 seconds behind the Dutchman and Red Bulls Sergio Perez came in third. Max Verstappen celebrates his 14th victory of the season. Chris GraythenGetty Images Verstappen started on pole and glided away while Hamilton behind him overtook teammate George Russell. The two teams began on different tires  Mercedes on the mediums in the hope of challenging the Dutchmans dominance with Red Bull on the softs  and for a while the cars were evenly matched. Red Bull pitted their drivers first opting for medium tires while Hamilton fitted hard tires so that he would not have to pit again. Ultimately Mercedes strategy did not pay off as Hamilton could only watch Verstappen increase his lead and team boss Toto Wolff later acknowledged over the radio that it was maybe not the right tire choice according to the BBC. But for all of Verstappen and Red Bulls achievements this year there was a shadow cast over the team on Sunday after it was sanctioned for a budget cap breach last year. Red Bull Racing RBR and the FIA agreed an Accepted Breach Agreement ABA for the teams breaking of F1s cost cap rules in 2021 the sports governing body announced on Friday. RBR were found to have breached the cost cap by 432652 501409. Max Verstappen has now won eight of the last nine F1 races. Chris GraythenGetty Images The punishment amounts to a fine of 7 million a 10 reduction in cost limits for RBRs aerodynamic testing for next year and responsibility for the costs incurred by the Cost Cap Administration who were responsible for investigating the breach. In the FIA statement the Cost Cap Administration noted that RBR acted cooperatively throughout the review process and that there is no accusation or evidence that RBR has sought at any time to act in bad faith. The more draconian part is the sporting penalty which is a 10 reduction on our ability to utilise our wind tunnel and aerodynamic tools team boss Christian Horner said in a press conference according to ESPN. That represents anywhere between 0.25 seconds and 0.5 seconds of lap time. That comes in from now it has a direct effect on next years car and it will be in place for a 12month period. Two races remain on the F1 calendar for Verstappen to add to his record tally with the Brazilian Grand Prix scheduled on November 13 and the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on November 20.
Max Verstappen sets F1 wins record with 14th victory of the 2022 season, https://motorsports.nbcsports.com/2022/10/30/max-verstappen-sets-f1-season-wins-record-with-14th-victory-mexico/, MEXICO CITY  It quickly became clear this would be the year that Max Verstappen set the record for most wins in an F1 season. Verstappen set the F1 record for wins in a season Sunday at the Mexico City Grand Prix with his 14th victory of the season. I try to win races and that is the most important thing. The team has won 16 of 21 F1 races this season with Verstappen and Sergio Perez winner at Monaco and Singapore. But the fans love their native driver and before the race Perez took a ride around the track on the back of a convertible Volkswagen., MEXICO CITY  It quickly became clear this would be the year that Max Verstappen set the record for most wins in an F1 season. It was never a question of if the Dutchman would win 14 races. It was only a question of when. And now By how much will Verstappen ultimately shatter the mark he shared with Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel Verstappen set the F1 record for wins in a season Sunday at the Mexico City Grand Prix with his 14th victory of the season. It broke the record set by Schumacher in 2004 and tied by Vettel it 2013. Unbelievable what a season and what a fantastic race To achieve 14 wins in a season is down to all the hard work by everyone in the team lets keep this going redbullracing HondaRacingGLB pic.twitter.comnG6uMggIPA  Max Verstappen Max33Verstappen October 30 2022 Verstappen only shared the mark with the Germans for all of one week following his victory last Sunday at Circuit of the Americas in Texas. Paired with wins at Miami Montreal and now Mexico City Verstappen swept the North American portion of this years F1 schedule. Just another day for Verstappen. I was never really interested in stats Verstappen said. I always just live in the moment. I try to do the best I can every single weekend. I try to win races and that is the most important thing. I am not that interested in keeping up with every stat. It is amazing season and we are happy to be winning. Verstappen retained his F1 world championship with four races remaining in the season clinched the constructors championship for Red Bull with three races remaining in the season and has two races left to thoroughly demolish the winsinaseason record. Red Bull has won nine consecutive races tying the team record set in 2013. The team has won 16 of 21 F1 races this season with Verstappen and Sergio Perez winner at Monaco and Singapore. Lewis Hamilton finished second for the second consecutive week. He might have had a shot at his first win of the season but Mercedes made the wrong call on a tire change that gave Verstappen control. We didnt choose the right tire strategy in hindsight Hamilton said. Nonetheless to be this close to Red Bull makes me very proud of my team. Were getting closer to the front and we will continue to push. The last couple of races weve taken a big step forward with the car and I hope we will continue like this for the final two. Perez finished third on his home track for the second consecutive year  earning deafening cheers even though a Mexican driver has yet to win at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez. Perez has been mobbed by adoring fans all week in his return. It began with a demonstration run in his hometown of Guadalajara before he arrived at the circuit where Perez has been swarmed by crowds as soon as he enters the paddock. He had to use a back route to get to the Red Bull garage each ontrack session as drivers and teams complained most of the weekend that the spectators who had purchased paddock access were too aggressive. But the fans love their native driver and before the race Perez took a ride around the track on the back of a convertible Volkswagen. He often held his hand to his heart to show his appreciation to the 120000plus fans. Its been incredible honestly Perez told the crowd in Spanish after the race. Thank you for all the support youve given me this weekend. Youre incredible the best fan base. Thank you. The threeday weekend sold out in two minutes earlier this year and the threeday crowd of 395902 broke the mark set last year of 371779. F1 also said ahead of the race that it had extended its contract with the race  often voted most popular among fans  through 2025. The day belonged to Verstappen who started from the pole and won for the 34th time in his career. He held the lead at the start as Hamilton passed teammate George Russell for second and Perez also made it past Russell. Hamilton might have raced for the win and was the leader when he pitted and Mercedes chose the harder more durable tire compound. Verstappen had a softer and faster tire and Hamilton lacked the speed to challenge for the victory. Hamilton has two more chances to avoid the first winless season of his career. Pierre Gassly meanwhile earned another two penalty points for running Lance Stroll wide off track and the Frenchman is now one penalty point away from a onerace suspension.

In his recordextending fourth win in Mexico City Verstappen stretched his lead over Hamilton during the second half of the race to win by more than 15 seconds. What an unbelievable season said Verstappen speaking to Sky Sports after a 14th triumph of the campaign that moved him ahead of the record set by Michael Schumacher in 2004 and matched by Sebastian Vettel in 2013. Simply unstoppableMax33Verstappen makes it an extraordinary FOURTEEN wins in 2022 breaking the record for the most wins in a season2TheMax MexicoGP pic.twitter.comTE7mOJ9o4b  Formula 1 F1 October 30 2022 Its an incredible atmosphere. We love to come here. Its been an incredible year so far. We are definitely enjoying it and we will try to go for more. Red Bulls Sergio Perez could not become the first Mexican to win the race but was enthusiastically roared on as he finished third ahead of Mercedes George Russell. Tyre troubles thwart Mercedes Hamilton reflected that Mercedes should have joined Red Bull in starting on soft rather than medium tyres after the seventime champion repeatedly struggled having started on mediums and switched to hard tyres after 25 laps. Russell wanted to be switched to soft tyres and Mercedes boss Toto Wolff whose team had told Hamilton during the race that their rivals on mediums would falter accepted that they had made the wrong choice. That should not reduce the credit afforded to Verstappen for achieving the rare feat of starting on pole in Mexico City and maintaining the lead beyond the first corner. Hamilton had been on blistering early form and the race felt in the balance before his tyre change which heralded Verstappen gradually pulling away. Russell briefly led and Hamilton was left to rue what might have been during a race lacking drama as Verstappen celebrated at the end. I would have been really intrigued to see what would have happened if we had started with the medium and gone on to the soft said Russell adding that he had felt like he was driving on ice. Mega job everyone Thanks for continuing to push. They were just too quick for us today. But lets keep pushing. Were getting closer. pic.twitter.com7JRblD6ouD  MercedesAMG PETRONAS F1 Team MercedesAMGF1 October 30 2022 Seventime champion Hamilton failed to secure his first win of the season and said Ultimately maybe they had the better tyre strategy. Im not sure it was the right tyre in the end  we should have started on the soft. Congratulations to Max. Perez pride on homecoming Perez had started in fourth with a fervent fanbase hoping the driver known as Checo would challenge in his seventh home Grand Prix. In search of a fifth race win of his career the man who comes from a motorsport family was passionately supported by relatives including his father Antonio Perez Garibay. Perez senior watched intently with headphones on during the race and showed as much pride as he did energy when he waved the Mexican flag while his son took to the podium. The atmosphere would have been sensational had Perez won but his performance in separating the Mercedes pairing was met with vigour by the crowd. Mercedes had gambled that Perezs medium tyres would cause him to fade and allow Russell through in the closing laps but he finished more than 31 seconds clear. Overtaking was so difficult so I had to stay in third Perez said afterwards. I thought we were going to be a little closer but it didnt work out. Its a good podium. In front of this crowd I wanted more  but third place is still a good day.

Poor Kevin Magnussen who was having trouble before the race is last at the moment. Mick Schumachers two places ahead of him. A forgettable one for Haas. Lap 7 The gap between Russell and the top two is widening. Its still Verstappen Hamilton Perez and Russell making up the top four with Carlos Sainz in fifth. Lap 6 Perez is pesky for Mercedes in the battle with Red Bull preventing them from ganging up on Verstappen. Lap 5 Interesting to overhear the instructions being given to Alfa Romeos Valtteri Bottas in eighth. Theyre telling the Finn that hes in a strong position and advising him to stick to whatever their original prerace plan was. Lap 3 Hamilton takes about 0.3 seconds off Verstappens lead with the fastest lap of the race so far reducing it to 1.2 seconds. Perez remains third. Fernando Alonso who didnt sound terribly optimistic before the race has moved up two places to seventh. Lap 1 Kudos to Verstappen who has the rare distinction of holding the lead from pole around Turn One in Mexico. Hamilton in second leads Russell but its all about Perez for most of the fans who respond in kind as their man makes a strong start by taking Russells spot in third 5 mins until lights out Verstappen starts on soft tyres. Russell and Hamilton are on mediums which means they should be able to last longer before taking a pit stop. Intriguing.

Verstappen whose Red Bull team opted for a softmedium tyre strategy took the chequered flag some 15 seconds clear of Hamilton who was left to question why Mercedes swapped their starting set of mediums for hards. But after experiencing technical problems throughout the qualifying hour Checo had to make do with fourth on the grid lining up behind polesitting Red Bull team mate Verstappen and the Mercedes cars of Russell and Hamilton. Alonso had been firmly in that fight behind the Red Bull Mercedes and Ferrari cars but a failure failure with just six laps to go ended his afternoon and added a fresh twist in the battle for P4 in the constructors standings. Verstappen has now achieved the most race wins in a single F1 season, Max Verstappen claimed his 14th victory of the 2022 season in the Mexico City Grand Prix ahead of Mercedes rival Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull team mate Sergio Perez after an intriguing strategic battle played out at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez. It secures another record for the Dutchman in his burgeoning career as he now boasts the most wins in a single F1 campaign moving one clear of the 13 achieved by Michael Schumacher 2004 and Sebastian Vettel 2013. Verstappen whose Red Bull team opted for a softmedium tyre strategy took the chequered flag some 15 seconds clear of Hamilton who was left to question why Mercedes swapped their starting set of mediums for hards. Perez gave the home fans something to cheer about in third having threatened to challenge Hamilton late on while Russell  who lost out to his team mate at the start  took a distant fourth. FORMULA 1 GRAN PREMIO DE LA CIUDAD DE MXICO 2022 Mexico 2022 Race results POSITION TIME POINTS 1 Max Verstappen VER Red Bull Racing 13836.729 25 2 Lewis Hamilton HAM Mercedes 15.186s 18 3 Sergio Perez PER Red Bull Racing 18.097s 15 4 George Russell RUS Mercedes 49.431s 13 5 Carlos Sainz SAI Ferrari 58.123s 10 Russell was also unhappy with his strategy repeatedly asking Mercedes to pit again and ditch the hard tyres which failed to bring the race back to the Silver Arrows in the closing stages  a stop for softs with two laps to run at least yielding the fastest lap. Ferrari endured a lacklustre race as Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc claimed lonely P5 and P6 finishes ahead of McLaren driver Daniel Ricciardo who charged his way to seventh with soft tyres late on and kept the position despite a 10second time penalty for a clash with Yuki Tsunoda. Esteban Ocon placed eighth after a painful late retirement for Alpine team mate Fernando Alonso as the other McLaren of Lando Norris and Alfa Romeos Valtteri Bottas  not quite able to repeat his qualifying performance  completed the points. Strategy played a key role throughout Sundays race in Mexico City AlphaTauri driver Pierre Gasly picked up a fivesecond penalty for an early aggressive move on Aston Martin rival Lance Stroll and ultimately missed out on a point by just half a second with Alex Albon 12th for Williams. Zhou Guanyu got his Alfa Romeo to the line ahead of Aston Martin pair Vettel  sporting a touching tribute helmet to the late Dietrich Mateschitz  and Stroll followed by the Haas cars of Mick Schumacher and Kevin Magnussen. Nicholas Latifi was the final finisher in his Williams with the aforementioned Alonso grinding to a halt with an engine issue late on and Tsunoda retiring after briefly going airborne in his collision with Ricciardo. Race Highlights 2022 Mexico City Grand Prix AS IT HAPPENED A sellout crowd delivered a party atmosphere in the build up to Sundays race with the every move of home hero Perez being enthusiastically cheered as had been the case throughout practice and qualifying earlier in the weekend. But after experiencing technical problems throughout the qualifying hour Checo had to make do with fourth on the grid lining up behind polesitting Red Bull team mate Verstappen and the Mercedes cars of Russell and Hamilton. Intriguingly Verstappen and Perez opted for soft tyres to attack the run of more than 800 metres to Turn 1 with Russell and Hamilton going for mediums  meaning there would be an array of strategic permutations to keep an eye on as the encounter developed. At the back Haas driver Magnussen started 19th with a fiveplace grid penalty for an engine change with Aston Martins Stroll in P20  having been docked three places for his clash with Alpine rival Alonso in Austin. When the lights went out and the 71lap race roared into life Verstappen made a clean getaway to defend from the Mercedes drivers off the line and down to Turn 1 before Hamilton pounced on Russell in the middle of the first chicane to take P2. As Verstappen held the lead at the start Hamilton got the jump on Russell for P2 Perez then got a run on Russell exiting the tight Turn 123 complex and having jumped out of the slipstream swept around the outside of his rival at Turn 4 sparking another deafening roar in the grandstands lining the circuit as he moved into the podium places. Sainz held fifth in his Ferrari with the Alfa Romeo of qualifying star Bottas dropping back to eighth behind the other F175 of Leclerc and between the Alpines of Alonso and Ocon  McLaren driver Norris rounding out the top 10. In the early laps Hamilton went with leader Verstappen and initially sat little more than a second adrift of his 2021 title rival before dropping back by a few tenths  engine cooling a crucial factor for consideration amid the high altitude and warm temperatures. You just need to try and break this tow. Youre doing a great job was the message to Verstappen shortly afterwards with almost two seconds separating himself and Hamilton by Lap 10 when attention started to turn to the pit stops. Verstappen edged away from Hamilton before the focus turned to the pit lane Some drama in the midfield involved Gasly forcing his way past Stroll under braking for Turn 4 on Lap 14 but the stewards quickly determined that the AlphaTauri man had forced the Aston Martin off the track and handed him a fivesecond time penalty. While Verstappen continued to edge away from Hamilton up front Perez sat around six seconds off the lead and Russell 7.5s as Sainz and Leclerc settled into a quiet race of their own  the Ferraris struggling to live with the pace of the Red Bull and Mercedes machines. As the race moved past the 20lap mark Verstappen reported some tyre concerns  at one point stating the left front doesnt want to turn  with Red Bull stretching out their opening stint on softs and the Mercedes duo biding their time on the more durable mediums. Perez was the first of the frontrunners to pit on Lap 24 swapping his softs for mediums in a tardy fivesecond stop due to a sticking rearleft tyre with Verstappen pitting two laps later releasing Hamilton and Russell into the lead. While Perez fell behind yettostop Ferrari pair Sainz and Leclerc forcing him to pull off some extra overtaking and spark further cheers from the home fans Verstappen slotted into P3 some 20 seconds off new leader Hamilton who reported that my tyres are okay. Hamilton did all he could to keep the pressure on Verstappen and Red Bull Nonetheless on Lap 30 Hamilton and Mercedes decided it was time to pit switching from mediums to hards while Russell asked to extend his stint and aim to bolt on a set of softs in the closing stages of the race. Russell temporarily led Verstappen by some 10 seconds with Hamilton six seconds further back but lighting up the timing screens on the harder tyres  giving his team mate some extra information to consider ahead of his own stop. Russells soft tyre ambitions were shortlived as he boxed on Lap 35 to follow Hamilton onto the hard tyres rejoining the action in fourth around 16 seconds off the lead before being told to lift and coast for the remainder of the race. His initially competitive pace on the hards fading Hamilton reported that they did not feel as comfortable as the mediums and Russell soon joined him on the radio to question the strategic move  but Mercedes sought to reassure both drivers that the race would come back to them. Further back Sainz and Leclerc continued their race as the best of the rest as Ocon joined Alonso in getting past Bottas with a fine move to put the Alpines in P7 and P8 respectively  Norris keeping his hands on the final point with 20 laps to run. There was plenty of midfield scrapping between Bottas and the Alpines On Lap 51 Norriss team mate Ricciardo tipped the AlphaTauri of Tsunoda into the air at Turn 6 amid a fierce wheeltowheel scrap prompting the stewards to hand the Australian a 10second time penalty  Tsunoda pitting to retire his damaged car. But the punishment appeared to fire Ricciardo up as he used his relatively fresh soft tyres to pass Norris Bottas Alonso and Ocon moving up to P7 and doing all he could to build enough of a margin and still emerge with some points. With the race entering its final 15 laps Verstappen found himself leading Hamilton by more than 10 seconds while Perez closed in on the Mercedes in a bid to bag another Red Bull onetwo finish  both Hamilton and Russell continuing to question the mediumhard strategy. Despite further reassurances from the Mercedes pit wall that the race would come their way in the form of the Red Bulls hitting late tyre trouble Verstappen had no such problems and eked out a 15second winning margin. Perez was unable to reel in Hamilton for P2 but at least made the podium in his home race while Russell pitted with two laps to run to bolt on a set of softs and score an extra point with the fastest lap. Verstappen celebrates victory number 14 of the season in front of the Mexican fans Sainz and Leclerc finished around a minute behind Verstappen while Ricciardo did just enough to build the required 10second margin over Ocon for P7 as Norris and Bottas rounded out the pointspaying positions. Alonso had been firmly in that fight behind the Red Bull Mercedes and Ferrari cars but a failure failure with just six laps to go ended his afternoon and added a fresh twist in the battle for P4 in the constructors standings. Gasly and Albon narrowly missed out on points for AlphaTauri and Williams with Zhou having to settle for P13 in the second Alfa Romeo followed by the Aston Martins of Vettel and Stroll. Haas also left emptyhanded as Schumacher led Magnussen home in P16 and P17 respectively with Latifi the last driver to take the chequered flag after Alonso and Tsunodas retirements. Verstappen has now achieved the most race wins in a single F1 season

Hamilton: Red Bull "too fast" for Mercedes to beat in F1 Mexican GP, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/hamilton-red-bull-too-fast-for-mercedes-to-beat-in-f1-mexican-gp/10393051/, I was so close I think in that first stint Hamilton said of his initial stint on the medium tyres but I think the Red Bull was just clearly too fast today. Im not sure the hard was the right tyre in the end. It was OK in the first stint but the hard tyre was just offset. Hamilton had to be content with second 15s off Verstappen by the end as the Red Bull pace showed little sign of dying down. Verstappen then made a gain of time in the pitstop phase and got his lead to over 10s as Hamilton struggled to stabilise the gap on the hard tyres., Listen to this article Both Hamilton and George Russell began the race on medium tyres with Mercedes trying to counter Red Bulls start on the soft rubber as Max Verstappen wanted to cover off the threat of a run into the first corner. Although it seemed that Mercedes was going to attempt to go long into the race on the mediums and switch to softs at the end the team instead made the jump to hards with Hamilton before halfdistance with Russell following suit. The pair could occasionally match the Red Bulls on pace but the gambit of waiting for the medium tyres on Verstappen and Sergio Perezs cars to fade away did not work as tyre wear proved low throughout the race. I was so close I think in that first stint Hamilton said of his initial stint on the medium tyres but I think the Red Bull was just clearly too fast today. Ultimately maybe they had the better tyre strategy. Im not sure the hard was the right tyre in the end. I thought we should have started on the soft obviously we had the opposite tyre. It was OK in the first stint but the hard tyre was just offset. Congratulations to Max its great to be up here and separate the two. Hamilton had to be content with second 15s off Verstappen by the end as the Red Bull pace showed little sign of dying down. The Briton had been around two seconds behind Verstappen on the opening stint as the race settled down but was unable to arrest the steady progression of the gap out in front. Verstappen then made a gain of time in the pitstop phase and got his lead to over 10s as Hamilton struggled to stabilise the gap on the hard tyres. This grew amid the virtual safety car period for Fernando Alonso as the Alpine drivers engine died in the late stages of the race. Perez had got close to Hamilton in the second phase of the race even getting to within DRS range but the Mexican was unable to find a way past at his home race. I gave my best today and really pushed hard Perez said after the race. But overtaking is so difficult. As soon as I got behind him it was really difficult to follow. I had to take third.

The two penalty points take Gasly to 10 in a 12month period. That is just two from a race ban and he will not lose any of his existing penalty points until next May. Read moreThe strict nature of the F1 penalty points system has been criticised by several drivers at various times in recent years. The stewards are supposedly limited with what they can do as there is effectively a set list of sanctions and associated licence penalty points to choose from., Pierre Gasly is on the brink of a race ban in Formula 1 after picking up another penalty in the Mexican Grand Prix. Gasly was given a fivesecond time penalty and one licence point for gaining advantage by going off track  and forcing Lance Stroll to do likewise  while making a pass in the opening stint of the race . The AlphaTauri driver locked up and ran deep into Turn 4 going beyond the white line himself with Stroll on the outside. The two penalty points take Gasly to 10 in a 12month period. That is just two from a race ban and he will not lose any of his existing penalty points until next May. It means Gasly must complete the final two races of 2022 and the first seven races of next year without any incidents that earn him two penalty points. GASLYS PENALTY SITUATION Offence Penalty points Spain Collision with Stroll 2 Austria Collision with Vettel 2 Austria Leaving the track without a justifiable reason multiple times 1 Japan Speeding under red flag conditions 2 United States Fell more than 10 car lengths behind during the safety car 2 Mexico Going off track and gaining advantage in Stroll pass 1 Gasly had acknowledged earlier in the weekend that he was quite close to being banned for a race expressed frustration to be in the position when I dont feel like Ive been that dangerous over the last 12 months. It would be a shame to get a race ban for slowing down a bit too much behind the safety car and a couple of track limits infringements this year he said. Alpine move is Gaslys shot at redemption  but will he use it Read more The strict nature of the F1 penalty points system has been criticised by several drivers at various times in recent years. Currently any penalty issued also comes with licence points by default. The stewards are supposedly limited with what they can do as there is effectively a set list of sanctions and associated licence penalty points to choose from. Gasly suggested that the FIA is working on it and claimed probably for next year theres going to be changes. At the moment youre losing points for these safetycar infringements or track limits and obviously the penalty for it is a race ban which we all agree and also the stewards agree is quite harsh said Gasly. I think theyre working on it and theres something that should be different for next year.
F1 Mexican GP: Verstappen cruises to record 14th victory of 2022, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/f1-mexican-gp-verstappen-cruises-to-record-14th-victory-of-2022/10393007/, Home hero Sergio Perez finished third ahead of George Russell with the Ferrari drivers a minute behind by the finish in fifth and sixth. Just before they braked for Turn 1 Russell moved left to the outside line but ended up just following Verstappen through the right hander and deep towards the grass runoff on the outside. As Verstappen scampered through unopposed Russell bounced over the kerbs at Turn 2 with Hamilton by this time alongside his teammate and getting ahead with better drive out of Turn 3. Leclerc the last car on the lead lap and 10s behind his teammate the drama to the finish concerned McLarens Daniel Ricciardo. In clear air from there Ricciardo charged and eventually finished 12.1s ahead of Ocon to negate his penalty., After acing the start from pole and once it became clear well ahead of the final laps that his medium tyres would hold on Verstappen dominated to take a 14th victory of 2022 and in doing so set a new record for single season wins. Home hero Sergio Perez finished third ahead of George Russell with the Ferrari drivers a minute behind by the finish in fifth and sixth. At the start Verstappen launched well in front of Russell and swung right in front of the Mercedes on the very long run down to the first corner  with Russell gaining from the Red Bulls slipstream to run ahead of Hamilton and Perez. Just before they braked for Turn 1 Russell moved left to the outside line but ended up just following Verstappen through the right hander and deep towards the grass runoff on the outside. As Verstappen scampered through unopposed Russell bounced over the kerbs at Turn 2 with Hamilton by this time alongside his teammate and getting ahead with better drive out of Turn 3. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes W13 Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images There Russell came along Hamilton but ran out of room and had to climb over the kerbs therefore losing momentum and being jumped the quickly arriving Perez into Turn 4 at the end of the second straight. Verstappen immediately moved out of DRS threat at the end of lap one of 71 with Hamilton giving chase having started on the medium tyres as did Russell compared to the used softs fitted to the two Red Bulls. Over the next phase of the race the gap between the leaders fluctuated slightly but generally held around 1.5s as Perez and Russell ran a few seconds further adrift and falling further behind over the course of the first stint. Approaching the end of the races first quarter Verstappen upped his pace in a bid to break the tow to the Mercedes but Hamilton was able to hang on just over two seconds behind before the leaders softs began to give up. From a maximum of 2.4s Verstappens advantage was down to 1.6s by the time he came in at the end of lap 25  one tour after Perez had pitted and suffered a slow leftrear change that left him stationary for 5.0s. Running the more durable tyre Mercedes left Hamilton out  his mediums showing none of the dark wear patches that had been evident on Verstappnens leftfront soft before he stopped. But Hamilton only remained out for another four laps before he was brought in to switch to the hard tyres with Mercedes instead leaving Russell out to complete a much longer first stint. He therefore led until the end of lap 34 Verstappen cycling back into the lead at halfdistance with a near seven second lead and Hamilton under more pressure from Perez running closely behind  the Mexican driver having cleared the offthepace Ferrari pair after his slow stop. Max Verstappen Red Bull Racing RB18 Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images Hamilton suggested the hards were not performing as well as the mediums he had given up with Mercedes in turn implying performance drop off logged at the end of his first stint might give him a chance to catch Verstappen late on. That looked a mighty ask 15 laps into Hamiltons second as he faced a near 10s gap to the dominant leader but at least able to keep Perez at arms length just a few seconds behind. Indeed the status quo continued to hold with Hamilton questioning whether his hard tyre set was the right compound to be on and Mercedes insisting it was due to its added durability on a onestopper. But with Verstappen continuing to edge away by a few tenths each lap as the leaders made their way through traffic with 15 laps left he had a lead of 12.1s. As it turned out Mercedes hoped for dramatic pace drop off for Red Bull never happened and Verstappen romped home to win by 15.1s having completed a mammoth 46lap final stint on the mediums. A late race stoppage for Fernando Alonso who had been running comfortably in seventh before an engine issue caused him to lose pace and eventually stop in the Turn 1 runoff did not cause much of a disruption other than a short virtual safety car activation on laps 6566. Perez ended up 2.9s behind Hamilton having fallen further behind shortly before the VSC with Russell fourth and also vocally frustrated about having to run the hards in his second stint. That ended up only being his middle stint as Mercedes pitted Russell to take the softs for a final lap shot at the fastest lap bonus point which the Briton duly secured with a 1m20.153s. Carlos Sainz Ferrari F175 Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images Carlos Sainz led Charles Leclerc home in an anonymous race for Ferrari  the Spaniard ending up 58.8s adrift of Verstappen and the only action for the pair involving Perezs poststop passing and Sainz doing likewise to Alonso after his own service to go from softs to mediums. Leclerc the last car on the lead lap and 10s behind his teammate the drama to the finish concerned McLarens Daniel Ricciardo. He had produced the second longest opening stint on the mediums in staying out until lap 45 after which he was rapid on the softs but made a bad error hitting Yuki Tsunoda at Turn 6 a few laps after his pitstop. With the AlphaTauri retiring in the pits Ricciardo was handed a 10stime addition penalty which he overcame with a sterling drive up the field after being waved by teammate Lando Norris who was completing the mediumhard strategy. Ricciardo produced pass after pass  including being part of a double move on Alonso into Turn 1 shortly before the Spaniard retired with his teammate Esteban Ocon going by ahead of Ricciardo into Turn 1 before in turn being caught and passed by the Australian. In clear air from there Ricciardo charged and eventually finished 12.1s ahead of Ocon to negate his penalty. Norris and Valtteri Bottas who had dropped back on lap one after his fine qualifying and then battled the Alpines in the first and middle phases of the race before falling back completing the top 10. Tsunoda was the races only other retirement.

Weve broken down everything you need to know in order to stream todays race and all the other F1 races this season. Dan IstiteneFormula 1Getty Images What is F1 and how is it different from IndyCar Both IndyCar and F1 are openwheeled singleseater racing formats. This means that the cars can only fit one person and have uncovered wheels that protrude from the body of the vehicle. Despite their basic similarities F1 and IndyCar offer very different experiences. In F1 there are only 10 teams with two drivers apiece for a total of 20 drivers. Most races must go for 305 km which is about 190 miles. Each driver needs to use two different tires in the race so a pit stop is mandatory though cars are not allowed to refuel. Races average around two hours in length and are held at venues all over the world. Teams spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year developing their cars. All cars must have certain elements  for example gearboxes must have eight gears plus a reverse and last for six consecutive races  but teams have leeway to tweak and change some parts of their car including their engines in the pursuit of speed. In contrast the cars featured in IndyCar are more standardized. They all have the same aerodynamic kit and chassis and can only be powered by one of two engines  either a Honda or a Chevrolet. That said teams are allowed to develop some of their own parts like dampers and some of their suspensions. IndyCar races occur on a wide range of tracks from fast ovals to road and street courses. The length of the races also varies with some like the Indianapolis 500 lasting 500 laps and taking over three hours to complete. Not surprisingly refueling during pit stops is a big part of the strategy during IndyCar races. Teams can field more than two cars meaning that the amount of drivers on the grid fluctuates from race to race. IndyCar is mostly considered an American sport and does not have the same level of money and glamour associated with it compared to the globehopping F1 circuit. Why should I care about F1 F1 races might best be described as a sort of actionpacked chess match that takes place while drivers are throttling around a track at close to 200 mph. Teams need both strategy and skill to compete against some of the best minds in motorsports. F1 is also full of strong personalities. The Netflix documentary series F1 Drive to Survive follows many of the teams and drivers over the course of a year and has helped raise the profile of the sport in the US. Released in March season four of the series chronicles last years tight championship race between rivals Verstappen and Hamilton. It also focuses on the internal battles between drivers on the same team while giving viewers a peek into the tense pressurized world of elite racing. Does F1 stream on ESPN Plus ESPN does not air any F1 coverage on its ESPN Plus streaming service. If you want to watch the practices or races you will need a television provider of some kind or to pay for F1s 80 per season TV Pro subscription.

Wolff: Mexico is Mercedes’ best F1 chance yet of winning this season, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/wolff-mexico-mercedes-best-f1-chance-win/10392576/, Mercedes has typically performed better in race pace than through qualifying but team principal Wolff was uneasy about expressing confidence it had the car to win on Sunday. I think in all my life theres only a handful of occasions that Ive been confident and never in Formula 1 said Wolff. Asked if this was Mercedes best shot of winning a race so far this year Wolff replied Yeah I think so. The good thing is that in our simulations we had Mexico in a way on the radar as being the best race. For many years Mexico wasnt a good place for us because of the altitude said Wolff., Listen to this article George Russell and Lewis Hamilton fell threetenths of a second short of Max Verstappens pole position lap for Red Bull but struggled on their last run in Q3. Russell called his final lap terrible while Hamilton had an engine oscillation problem that impacted his last effort as he reported feeling power drop outs. Both Mercedes cars may benefit from getting a tow from Verstappen on the run from the starting grid to Turn 1 which is one of the longest of the season. Mercedes has typically performed better in race pace than through qualifying but team principal Wolff was uneasy about expressing confidence it had the car to win on Sunday. I think in all my life theres only a handful of occasions that Ive been confident and never in Formula 1 said Wolff. So the truth is I dont know. Im annoyed about not being on pole because it would have ticked a box but equally having Max with his top speed advantage behind us would have been a problem tomorrow. Starting second and third can be advantageous and I hope we can stick our nose or both noses into Turn 1 and disappear into the distance. But definitely thats going to be difficult. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes AMG on the grid after Qualifying Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images Mercedes has three races left to avoid its first winless campaign since 2011 having struggled to match the pace of Red Bull and Ferrari through much of the season. Asked if this was Mercedes best shot of winning a race so far this year Wolff replied Yeah I think so. The good thing is that in our simulations we had Mexico in a way on the radar as being the best race. So that is good that it correlates the virtual world correlates with the real world. The most important thing is that we really have the pace and slowly but surely we are going forward and learning the lessons for next year. One of the biggest boosts for Mercedes in Mexico came with the highaltitude conditions leading to reduced levels of drag in the thin air as well as allowing for high downforce packages to be used. For many years Mexico wasnt a good place for us because of the altitude said Wolff. But the power unit guys have really given us a super strong engine here. We suffered less from our draggy car here whilst running high downforce like all the others. Generally that has been better for us in the past.
Bottas aiming high from “surprising” sixth on Mexico F1 grid, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/bottas-aiming-high-from-surprising-sixth-on-mexico-f1-grid/10392717/, Yeah then its a pretty good day he said when asked by Motorsport.com about beating Leclercs works car. I mean weve seen from the beginning of the weekend that we seem pretty strong and I felt comfortable. But I think the layout  I was thinking about it before the weekend that it could be good for our car. I think all those slow speed corners we seem pretty strong. If you can gain obviously yes but without huge risk.Alfa Romeo team principal Fred Vasseur said that the car has been quick in recent races even if grid positions didnt fully reflect that., Listen to this article The Alfa Romeo driver split the two works Ferraris in qualifying outpacing the troubled Charles Leclerc for a spot on the third row of the grid. A good result on Sunday would be hugely valuable in his teams fight with Aston Martin for sixth in the championship which the Hinwil outfit leads by just three points. Bottas showed good pace from the start of the Mexican weekend taking seventh in FP1 and eighth in FP3 the two sessions not compromised by Pirelli 2023 tyre testing. However even he hadnt anticipated doing even better when it mattered in qualifying. Yeah then its a pretty good day he said when asked by Motorsport.com about beating Leclercs works car. And surprising. I mean weve seen from the beginning of the weekend that we seem pretty strong and I felt comfortable. So we thought with a good quali should be able to fight for seventh place but to split the Ferraris is an added bonus. Valtteri Bottas Alfa Romeo C42 Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images Bottas had no definitive explanation for why the Alfa is so strong in Mexico City especially given that the works Ferraris have experienced a loss of power at the highaltitude venue. Its a good question he said. We didnt add anything from Austin to this track. But I think the layout  I was thinking about it before the weekend that it could be good for our car. And it seems to be really good for our car. I think all those slow speed corners we seem pretty strong. Even over the kerbs through the chicanes we seem good and the car feels quite nice over the kerbs. So I think it just suits this track and then with the starting setup we had for the weekend weve only had to do small fine tuning. So we really started the weekend on the right foot with a setup and been able to build on that. Bottas acknowledged that he always goes well at the track It feels like its been normally good track for me overall. I think I had a pole last year. So naturally that just tells that its one of those tracks that some drivers like. I like this one smooth surfaces low grip. So its definitely a bit different way of driving which I dont mind. Bottas believes he can maintain position on Sunday given that there are no obviously quicker cars behind  other than Leclercs Ferrari which may be compromised by ongoing engine issues. Asked if he can stay sixth he said I think so thats the target.And it seems like from all the long runs this this weekend and even the Pirelli tests that we seem to be on the good end of the midfield in terms of race pace. So its good to see. So hopefully we can more or less maintain the position. Thats important because its a good opportunity as Aston is now way back. Given how important the points are for his team Bottas agreed that he cant be too aggressive on the first lap. Yeah its a calculated risk. Ive had many bad luck lap ones this this year. So even for my confidence would be good to have a good start and lap one so I think target is at least try and maintain the position. If you can gain obviously yes but without huge risk. Alfa Romeo team principal Fred Vasseur said that the car has been quick in recent races even if grid positions didnt fully reflect that. I think it was already the case the last two or three events the Frenchman told Motorsport.com. But between having the potential and being P6 there is a margin. And the last two or three events were wet sessions or we missed Q3 for nothing. I think the pace was okay in Austin and Suzuka. And I think from the beginning of this weekend we were on it. From FP1 we are doing a good job and then you can fine tune the situation. Vasseur said the result was a boost for the Swiss team just days after the 2026 Audi deal was announced Its encouraging for the people at home and on track. Its a mega huge push. They worked a lot. We are still 250 less people than our competitors and it means that when we have to bring updates they are pushing like hell and Im more than pleased for everybody.

Schumacher calls for F1 bollard change after track limits frustration, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/schumacher-calls-for-bollard-change-after-track-limits-frustration/10392729/, Had it stood until the end of the session it would still have been good enough for seventh. However the time was quickly deleted by the stewards for cutting track limits on the apex of Turn 2. At the end of the session Schumacher was left stranded in 16th. If we have a bollard it would be great if the bollard was positioned in such a manner that youre not able to go over track limits. We changed rear wing changed floor changed front wing because weve had some suspicions about what we were running., Listen to this article The Haas driver logged a lap of 1m19.965s towards the end of Q1 which at the time put him in sixth place. Had it stood until the end of the session it would still have been good enough for seventh. However the time was quickly deleted by the stewards for cutting track limits on the apex of Turn 2. At the end of the session Schumacher was left stranded in 16th. Schumacher admitted that he had been aggressive in taking a lot of kerb but said hed used the bollard on the apex as a reference  and suggested that it should have been placed in such a way that drivers couldnt be deemed to cut the corner if they aimed to brush past it. Well I knew it was aggressive he said when asked by Motorsport.com about the incident. But in my eyes it was going to be enough. If the bollard is there its there for a reason. I took reference off that. Unfortunately I think thats a point that well probably have to address because with these cars obviously these days its hard to see. If we have a bollard it would be great if the bollard was positioned in such a manner that youre not able to go over track limits. That would definitely help a lot all of us for sure. So yeah quite unfortunate. The difference of cutting it that much or not its probably less than a tenth. When Schumacher made a final attempt on used tyres he was also compromised when other drivers passed him before he could start the lap. He said that violated the gentlemans agreement about not passing other cars on preparation laps. It was always going to be tough he said. But I think more than that it was also the gentlemans agreement that wasnt kept by like three or four cars. Which was silly really. But its the way it is. It definitely hurt the preparation of the lap which meant I couldnt warm up the brakes just as much as I wanted it to and going to Turn 1 with the question mark. Kevin Magnussen Haas VF22 Photo by Mark Sutton  Motorsport Images Meanwhile Schumachers teammate Kevin Magnussen earned 15th in Q2 and then dropped back to 19th thanks to a grid penalty for a taking a new V6 engine. The team made significant changes to his car for qualifying. We treated qualifying a little bit like a test said the Dane when asked by Motorsport.com about the session. We changed rear wing changed floor changed front wing because weve had some suspicions about what we were running. So the car did change around a lot. And we had to really go a completely different direction on the front flap to get the balance to be similar. So theres some stuff to look at tonight for sure. Asked if the car was better in its revised form he conceded that it was hard to tell. It might be but we were just so far off that we never really got back into the right spot he explained. You only get so many chances in qualifying. He also admitted that the team may now decide to make further changes that would oblige him to sacrifice 19th on the grid and start from the pitlane For sure were thinking about that.

Leclerc fears “nightmare” Mexican GP after Ferrari F1 qualifying woes, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/leclerc-fears-nightmare-mexico-f1-race-after-ferrari-qualifying-woes/10392704/, Telemetry indicated to the pit that the DRS had operated correctly but the aero engineers could see that Leclerc still had full load. There was something strange or wrong with the engine he said when asked by Autosport about his qualifying session. And also the engine was not really responding to the throttle input I was having in the high speed. And Red Bull and Mercedes seems to be stronger than that for the whole weekend. But for me FP3 and qualifying there was something more specific that I dont know yet what the problem was., Both Leclerc and teammate Carlos Sainz have experienced a lack of power at the highaltitude circuit with some rivals suspecting that the team may have detuned its power units in a search for reliability. Earlier this year Sainz suffered a fiery engine failure at the Red Bull Ring another venue where altitude is an issue and a nonfinish in Mexico could be costly in the teams battle for second place in the championship. Leclerc suffered more than his teammate on Saturday and he also had a DRS issue on the back straight in his final run in Q3 leaving him only seventh on the grid. Telemetry indicated to the pit that the DRS had operated correctly but the aero engineers could see that Leclerc still had full load. Leclercs weekend had already been compromised by a heavy crash in FP2 which damaged his gearbox. There was something strange or wrong with the engine he said when asked by Autosport about his qualifying session. I was losing quite a lot of time down the straights from FP3 to Q3 not compared to the Red Bull or Mercedes because this has been the case since day one and we knew it. There was something strange. And also the engine was not really responding to the throttle input I was having in the high speed. So I really hope we can fix those issues for tomorrow. Otherwise its going to be an extremely difficult race to be to be consistent. Carlos Sainz Ferrari F175 Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images Both Ferraris looked tricky in the highspeed corners but Leclerc admitted that it was hard for him to judge Its very difficult to comment on the balance because there was really a lot of inconsistency in the highspeed and it would not do exactly what I wanted with the engine. So I will get surprised and then get a snap. So yeah its difficult to compare the balance because it felt quite good when the engine was responding to what I was doing. But it was just very inconsistent. He added It was quite tricky on the kerbs. Unfortunately also on the bumps there were things that were happening that were very weird. Sainz who qualified in fifth indicated that he felt that unusually the Ferrari will be stronger in Sundays race than it was in qualifying. However Leclerc was not so optimistic. Again unfortunately I cannot comment on my side. If I still have the same issues then the race will be a nightmare. So I hope we can fix that. Leclerc insisted that his engine problem wasnt just down to the circuits altitude This this is the case since the beginning of FP1 with the altitude you lose a bit of performance. And Red Bull and Mercedes seems to be stronger than that for the whole weekend. But for me FP3 and qualifying there was something more specific that I dont know yet what the problem was.
Mercedes: F1 engine issue "definitely affected" Hamilton’s Mexico Q3 lap, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/mercedes-f1-hamilton-engine-issue-mexico-q3-lap/10392581/, Verstappen beat Russell and Hamilton to pole by three tenths of a second as both Mercedes drivers struggled in their final Q3 runs. Russell called his last lap terrible after running wide at Turn 12 and failing to improve his time while Hamilton revealed after the session that he felt an engine issue in Q3. We had some problem with the engine towards the end and in Q3 he said. But Ill find out from the team.Toto Wolff Team Principal and CEO Mercedes AMG Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport ImagesAsked by Motorsport.com about the issue Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff said there was an oscillation that had been spotted on Hamiltons engine. Nevertheless I think its a good result for the team second and third., Listen to this article Mercedes entered qualifying chasing only its second pole of the season after finishing 12 in FP3 but ultimately lost out to Red Bulls Max Verstappen in Q3 at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez. Verstappen beat Russell and Hamilton to pole by three tenths of a second as both Mercedes drivers struggled in their final Q3 runs. Russell called his last lap terrible after running wide at Turn 12 and failing to improve his time while Hamilton revealed after the session that he felt an engine issue in Q3. He qualified third five thousandths of a second off Russells time. Hamilton said it was generally a good qualifying session with no major issues but he felt the engine problem did cost him a bit of performance. We had some problem with the engine towards the end and in Q3 he said. So I definitely think there was performance left on the table. I did the best I could. Hamilton explained that the issue started to appear in Q2 and was then occurring on every run in Q3 basically dropping out of power on exits from corners. He added I do think we were losing quite a bit of time I think out of the last corner and basically out of most of the corners. It felt like an ignition issue. But Ill find out from the team. Toto Wolff Team Principal and CEO Mercedes AMG Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images Asked by Motorsport.com about the issue Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff said there was an oscillation that had been spotted on Hamiltons engine. That badly affects drivability said Wolff. So it definitely affected his lap. Hamiltons only valid time of Q3 was set on his final lap after his first effort earlier in the session was deleted due to exceeding track limits at Turn 2 setting a time that would have been onehundredth of a second slower than his second effect. Hamilton explained that losing the first lap made his second one very hard as he ensured he did not breach track limits again and risk setting no time at all which would have left him 10th. I had to be very reserved on that last lap just to make sure that it was clean because I was a tenth up to that point said Hamilton. Unfortunately I was not able to push as hard as Id have liked. Nevertheless I think its a good result for the team second and third. Its no bad position to start. I hope we can fix the problem on Sunday.
Alonso: We need to stop putting F1 fans against each other on social media, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/alonso-we-need-to-stop-putting-f1-fans-against-each-other-on-social-media/10392682/, In an interview with Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf that was published on Saturday twotime F1 world champion Alonso discussed former teammate Hamilton and current world champion Max Verstappen when reflecting on last years podium in Qatar. Alonso said he thought Verstappen had performed better than Hamilton last year and was a worthy champion in 2021 adding I also have a lot of respect for Lewis. Still it is different when you win seven world titles when you only had to fight with your teammate. Lets enjoy them.The quotes and tweet led to fierce discussion among fans on social media but Alonso said he wanted to try to help and make social media a better place by clearing up his comments. We need to stop putting the fans against each other., In an interview with Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf that was published on Saturday twotime F1 world champion Alonso discussed former teammate Hamilton and current world champion Max Verstappen when reflecting on last years podium in Qatar. Alonso said he thought Verstappen had performed better than Hamilton last year and was a worthy champion in 2021 adding I also have a lot of respect for Lewis. Still it is different when you win seven world titles when you only had to fight with your teammate. Then I think a championship has less value than when you have fewer titles but have had to fight against other drivers with equal or even better material. But after the quotes were picked up and started to circulate on more outlets stating that Alpine driver Alonso considered Verstappens championships to be more valuable than Hamiltons titles the Spaniard took to Twitter to clarify his comments. He wrote And again Please all the titles are amazing well deserved and inspiring. Incomparable to each other and lets enjoy champions and legends of our current time. Tired of the continuous search for headlines. Lets enjoy them. The quotes and tweet led to fierce discussion among fans on social media but Alonso said he wanted to try to help and make social media a better place by clearing up his comments. We need to all collaborate on that said Alonso. We need to stop putting the fans against each other. We are all in the same thing. Great champions great sportsmen and we try to enjoy this beautiful time. Alonso noted in the original interview that he did not fight against Renault teammate Giancarlo Fisichella for his titles in 2005 and 2006 nor did Verstappen battle against Sergio Perez or former teammate Alex Albon to win races. Fernando Alonso and Giancarlo Fisichella Renault celebrate in Parc Ferme Photo by Mark Sutton  Motorsport Images But Michael Schumacher in particular fought with his teammate Rubens Barrichello to become champion five times in a row and Hamilton with Nico Rosberg and Valtteri Bottas Alonso added. Thats different I think. But seemingly in response to Alonsos comments Hamilton posted a picture of them together on the podium from the 2007 United States Grand Prix when they were teammates at McLaren. The race saw Alonso fume at McLaren as he lost to Hamilton  then in his rookie season  amid an acrimonious season that ended with Alonso leaving after just a single year. Hamilton posted the picture of him standing on the top step of the podium with his hand on Alonsos shoulder simply with a thumbs up emoji. Additional reporting by Erwin Jaeggi

Max Verstappen Takes Mexico Grand Prix Pole Position, https://sports.ndtv.com/formula-1/max-verstappen-takes-mexico-grand-prix-pole-position-3473408, Twotime world champion Max Verstappen gave Red Bull reason to smile again on Saturday when he secured pole position for Sundays Mexico City Grand Prix with an authoritative late qualifying lap. Verstappen took control on his first run in Q3 and then trimmed his time to resist the threat from the muchimproved Mercedes team. The passion of the fans here is really incredible and in the stadium it is just amazing to drive there. The opening Q1 period saw Hamilton maintain Mercedes muchimproved form in the rarefied atmosphere at 2200 metres altitude by topping the times ahead of Verstappen and Leclerc. On his second run Verstappen regained third but was relegated a place by Sainz seizing second and splitting the silver arrows for Ferrari., Twotime world champion Max Verstappen gave Red Bull reason to smile again on Saturday when he secured pole position for Sundays Mexico City Grand Prix with an authoritative late qualifying lap. After 24 hours of arguments and derision following the announcement of Red Bulls penalty for breaching Formula Ones 145 million cost cap last year it was a sweet return to success with his sixth pole this year and the 17th of his career. The 25yearold Dutchman clocked a best lap of 1min 17.775sec to finish 0.304 seconds ahead of George Russell and his Mercedes teammate seventime champion Lewis Hamilton. Verstappen took control on his first run in Q3 and then trimmed his time to resist the threat from the muchimproved Mercedes team. He will be hunting a record 14th win in a single season on Sunday. That was a good qualifying the Dutchman said. It was a close one but we made a few adjustments to the car and got into a better rhythm so to be on pole here is of course amazing. Its a very long run down to Turn One here so we need a good start but I think we have a quick car and thats what is most important. The passion of the fans here is really incredible and in the stadium it is just amazing to drive there. His Red Bull teammate and local hero Sergio Perez was fourth ahead of Ferraris Carlos Sainz and a resurgent Valtteri Bottas of Alfa Romeo. Verstappen said he was sure Perez will be there in the fight tomorrow. Charles Leclerc who crashed heavily on Friday was seventh in the second Ferrari ahead of McLarens Lando Norris and the Alpines of twotime champion Fernando Alonso and Esteban Ocon. Russell was disappointed. Sorry sorry sorry he said on his team radio after running wide on his final lap. The team deserved more today. Theyve produced a really great car this weekend and it felt like our pole to have and I did a terrible lap at the end. Hamilton who had harboured hopes of doing better was philosophical. This is the best qualifying weve had all year. It just shows that perseverance and never giving up can pay off. Im quite happy with that position  its a along way to Turn One. The session came after many leading teams reacted negatively to Red Bulls 7 milliion fine and 10 percent reduction in permitted aerodynamic research for overspending last year. Ferrari said they were deeply unhappy and Mercedes said Christian Horners description of his teams punishment as draconian was an exaggeration while McLaren said it was not harsh enough.  Home hero Perez  All that was set aside when qualifying started at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez where the air temperature was 25 degrees Celsius and the track 49 near perfect conditions. The opening Q1 period saw Hamilton maintain Mercedes muchimproved form in the rarefied atmosphere at 2200 metres altitude by topping the times ahead of Verstappen and Leclerc. Fourtime champion Sebastian Vettel was among those eliminated. After a turbulent start to the season when they were beset by porpoising problems Mercedes had made steady progress and the RussellHamilton onetwo was their best session result of the year. Hamilton in 118.552 took command ahead of Russell by 0.013 seconds the pair heading Bottas and Verstappen on their first runs before Perez emerged alone to a roar from the sellout crowd. Checo Checo they chanted as he took third on a set of new soft tyres. On his second run Verstappen regained third but was relegated a place by Sainz seizing second and splitting the silver arrows for Ferrari. At the flag it was Daniel Ricciardo of McLaren Zhou Guayyu of Alfa Romeo Alpha Tauris Yuki Tsunoda and Pierre Gasly and Kevin Magnussen who missed out on the topten shootout. Promoted The top five were separated by less than onetenth of a second the top four by just 0.014 seconds  a clear signal of a close tussle for pole position to come as Perez went early into Q3. His 118.153 was swiftly beaten by Verstappen in 117.947 with a sensational lap that was unmatched on the first runs as Hamiltons best lap in 118.094 was deleted for exceeding track limits on the kerb at Turn Three.

The long run to Turn 1 Crucial to any drivers hopes of a good race is the start in Mexico City and weve often seen it impact matters at the front. Bottas between the Ferraris For another driver just having a quiet start appears to be the target with Valtteri Bottas finding himself on the third row., From Mercedes going for their first win of the year to the home favourite in the mix and from Valtteri Bottas threatening the frontrunners to the unique challenge of the circuits altitude we pick out some key areas to keep an eye on when the lights go out at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez 1. Can Mercedes finally win in 2022 It has been over a decade since Mercedes last endured a winless season in Formula 1 with 2011 the last time they failed to get at least one driver on the top step of the podium over the course of the year. They are in real danger of suffering the same fate this year but in Mexico City the team look as competitive as they have all season. READ MORE Verstappen fends off Mercedes pair for maiden Mexico City pole The challenge ahead of them is a clear one beat Max Verstappen. The double world champion spoiled Mercedes party on Saturday when he took pole position beating George Russell  who had been fastest in FP2 and FP3  and Lewis Hamilton who had topped Q1 and Q2. Verstappen has to be the favourite given his form and the pace of the Red Bull all year but this is certainly a circuit that has suited Mercedes because the high altitude means they suffer less from their high levels of drag even when keeping the cars high downforce level. Hamilton so nearly won in Austin and Mercedes showed they are getting closer to the front with an upgraded car so Mexico is probably their best chance to date. 2022 Mexico City GP Qualifying Max Verstappen seals pole position ahead of Mercedes pair 2. The long run to Turn 1 Crucial to any drivers hopes of a good race is the start in Mexico City and weve often seen it impact matters at the front. In each of the past four races the polesitter has failed to win the race and that is in no small part to the slipstream effect that leaves you vulnerable off the line. With the 2022 cars the tow has been reduced because the car in front is not punching the same type of hole in the air as in the past but it still has its benefits and with over 800 metres between pole position and the first braking zone there is plenty of opportunity for a following car to gain. READ MORE It was our pole to have says Russell as he and Hamilton rue Q3 mistakes in Mexico City While admitting its going to be difficult Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff says Starting second and third can be advantageous and I hope we can stick our nose or both noses into Turn 1 and then disappear into the distance. Russell and Hamilton wont be the only drivers aiming to make gains though as home hero Sergio Perez has a chance of making moves from fourth on the grid as he goes in search of what would be a massively popular victory among the passionate Mexican crowd. Could Mercedes pick up their first win of the year this weekend 3. Bottas between the Ferraris For another driver just having a quiet start appears to be the target with Valtteri Bottas finding himself on the third row. Bottas has seen his brilliant earlyseason form hit by a less competitive Alfa Romeo as the year has gone on but his onelap pace was clear to see as he was regularly near the top of the timing screens throughout qualifying. The Finn believed seventh place was the best he could target  behind the Red Bull Mercedes and Ferrari cars  but instead he managed to get the better of Charles Leclerc to secure sixth on the grid. READ MORE Its really uplifting for the whole team  Bottas revels in P6 performance at Mexico City qualifying Its a crucial time for Alfa Romeo too as they have seen their advantage in sixth place in the constructors championship whittled away by Aston Martin to the point they now sit just three points ahead Mike Kracks team. But with Sebastian Vettel starting from 16th place and Lance Stroll 20th theres a big opportunity for Bottas to earn them a little bit more breathing room. All smiles for Bottas who was in top form in qualifying 4. Alpine and McLaren resuming battle Its a similar story when it comes to Alpine and McLaren who appear to be intent on ensuring their fight for fourth overall goes down to the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi. Every time one team appears to have got the upper hand the other soon pegs them back and McLaren just chipped away at the Alpine advantage in Austin when Lando Norris overtook Fernando Alonso late on to close the gap to 11 points. FACTS AND STATS Verstappen starting P1 but no polesitter has finished on the podium here since 2016 Norris is again leading the way in the battle this weekend in Mexico starting from eighth ahead of Alonso in ninth and Esteban Ocon in tenth but Daniel Ricciardo is also right in the fight at this stage as well as he lines up directly behind the Alpine pair in 11th. Strategies are likely to come into play in a race where the Alpine straight line speed advantage is lessened and the French constructor could be the more nervous of the two teams when it comes to reliability having seen both cars retire in Singapore to provide McLaren with a big chance to close the gap a few races ago. The McLarenAlpine fight will continue here in Mexico
Ricciardo cops brutal miss but still lands best quali result in five races, https://www.foxsports.com.au/motorsport/formula-one/formula-1-2022-mexican-grand-prix-qualifying-results-times-blog-live-updates-stream-start-time-practice/news-story/83264ad786e849bf983e29b40888fc77, Daniel Ricciardo secured his best qualifying result in five races but narrowly missed out on an appearance in the third qualifying session for topten drivers at the Mexican Grand Prix.

I generally had a really good session today., Daniel Ricciardo secured his best qualifying result in five races but narrowly missed out on an appearance in the third qualifying session for topten drivers at the Mexican Grand Prix. It comes after the Australian opened up on the most challenging year ahead of qualifying. In an incredibly close and dramatic session Ricciardo made it out of Q1 for the first time in five races only to be dumped out as the 11thfastest driver in Q2 by just 0.053s.

New to Kayo Start your free trial now  But Max Verstappen already confirmed as the World Champion this season soared to pole ahead of the Mercedes duo George Russell and Lewis Hamilton. His 1m 17.775s left Russell second by 0.304s  after he had his final run rubbed off for exceeding track limits  and Hamilton a marginal 0.005s off in P3. Verstappen took control on his first run in Q3 and then trimmed his time to resist the threat from the muchimproved Mercedes team. He will be hunting a record 14th win in a single season on Sunday. That was a good qualifying the Dutchman said. It was a close one but we made a few adjustments to the car and got into a better rhythm so to be on pole here is of course amazing. Its a very long run down to Turn One here so we need a good start but I think we have a quick car and thats what is most important. The passion of the fans here is really incredible and in the stadium it is just amazing to drive there. Sergio Perez was fourth in the other Red Bull for his home Grand Prix. Ricciardo finished the third and final practice session in P14 the same result as the second practice session as the Australians struggles at McLaren continued. But he found pace in qualifying and will be disappointed not to have reached Q3 as one of the top 10 drivers. Audi get partner for 2026 F1 play  0027 It has been a tough year for Ricciardo who admitted in an interview with The Daily Mail ahead of this weeks race that he was not his normal bubbly self as results slipped. My confidence was being eaten away driving a car that wouldnt dance with me and would bite back Ricciardo said. Whenever we thought we found a solution along would come another set of challenges. When you put so much into something and it doesnt work out there is sadness. It gets to you. Last year it affected me a little bit too much. I wouldnt be my usual bubbly self. I would be reluctant if someone said lets go out for dinner. I would need some cajoling. I let it get to me. I started to speak to a psychologist last year the most challenging year I have had. Ricciardo will have a fresh start next year with the Australian expected to take up a reserve driver role either at Mercedes or Red Bull. It comes after McLarens decision to axe Ricciardo earlier this year something which the 33yearold admits came as a surprise. It is fair to say it was unexpected given I was on a threeyear deal that had a year to run he said. It is not something you can prepare for. But Id already had some honest discussions with Andreas Seidel team principal and Zak Brown chief executive earlier in the year to see what we could do to improve things. It was a concern on both sides. Qualifying disappointment for Ricciardo  0124 In other news having set the pace with a leading time of 1.19.970 Mercedes George Russell is hoping he and teammate Lewis Hamilton can continue their success in qualifying. Id like to think its definitely a podium thats possible at least. Its probably one of if not our best Friday of the year Russell told the Formula 1s official website when asked of his expectations for the weekend. Between the two of us Russell and team mate Lewis Hamilton weve got 14 podiums so far this season so thats absolutely what well be going for. But not having the normal FP2 running where you get to understand the long run the consecutive laps of your rivals its going to be difficult to know. Hamilton finished the day in fourth and having settled for second place at the United States Grand Prix he too is also keen to potentially shoot for top spot this weekend. I feel good I feel really really good he said. I generally had a really good session today. I really enjoyed driving around the track. The car is feeling better and better as we work more through it and we understand it more. George Russell is pretty confident. Photo by Jared C.

Leclerc though did not seem too worried about the damage impacting his chances ahead of qualifying and Monday mornings race. I dont think any of it will compromise us he said. I think we have enough parts now with all the penalties weve had in the past so it should be fine. Follow all the action with the live blog below Cant see it Click here

Qualifying Highlights 2022 Mexico City Grand Prix Q1  Hamilton fastest over Verstappen Though there was a 60 risk of rain for qualifying temperatures were high and the clouds were scattered above Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez in Q1. Williams and Haas  whose driver Magnussen has a fiveplace grid penalty having taken his sixth engine  began their runs first the rest of the field waiting a minute or two to hit the track. Verstappens first run was compromised by oversteer into Turns 1 and 2 but he set the early benchmark with a time of 1m 19.222s fastest in Sector 3 to go 0.283s faster than Leclerc who was another 0.018s faster than Bottas  the Finn in turn 0.004s faster than Hamilton who lost time in Sector 3. In the provisional drop zone was Schumacher in 16th leading Albon then Vettel Magnussen and Latifi. Schumacher improved with three minutes left but his lap was chalked off for track limits at Turn 2. There was plenty of margin left on the table but neither Ferrari emerged for a final run while Verstappen and Perez  who had to set a second flying lap with four minutes remaining  also declined another go. Hamilton shot to the top thereafter bumping Verstappen to second by 0.053s while Leclerc ended up third ahead of Bottas. Sainz rounded out the top five ahead of Russell and Perez settled for seventh almost half a second off his team mate. Hamiltons final run saw him go top in Q1 With a big hit of the kerbs at Turn 10 Norris took eighth Tsunoda ninth and then Ocon rounded out the top 10 ahead of Alpine team mate Alonso. Gasly Ricciardo Zhou and Magnussen made it to Q2  but Schumacher missed out on his 15thplace team mate by 0.126s. Vettel set the same time as Schumacher just later than his compatriot for 17th while Aston Martin team mate Stroll  who has a threeplace penalty for his Austin collision with Alonso  took 18th.

With a time of 1m 18.552s Hamilton set the fastest time early on with Russell  who relayed on the radio that he was worried about his brakes  0.013s behind and Bottas another twotenths off in P3. Verstappen meanwhile was 0.382s off the pace with his first run taking P4 ahead of Ocon. A huge tow on the front straight saw Leclerc begin his lap with an advantage but he lost time in Sector 2 and ended up 0.557s off the pace in P6. With three minutes left Perez  who was sitting 12th  once again emerged on a clear track and this time he found more than a second. Ricciardo Tsunoda Zhou Gasly and Magnussen were in the drop zone but the final runs were incoming. Hamilton retained top spot but Sainz improved to go 0.008s off the Mercedes Russell keeping third as he suffered a frontright lockup on his final run and Verstappen going 0.001s behind the Briton in P4 leaving Perez fifth  just 0.063s off the pace.

Perez began the shootout packedout Foro Sol grandstands emitting a goosebumpinducing roar for their home driver as he set a time of 1m 18.153s. Perez would drop down to third after Verstappen eclipsed him by twotenths Russell going a provisional second by 0.132s and Hamilton P3 by 0.147s  before track limits at Turn 3 cost him that flying lap. Worries compounded for Hamilton as he reported drivability issues soon after. Sainz then Bottas rounded out the top five.

Verstappen meanwhile improved to a 1m 17.775s and Russell had his final time chalked off to finish 0.304s off the champions pace. Hamilton couldnt sweep the sessions and for the 11thstraight year there would be a different polesitter at the Mexican Grand Prix Verstappens time would not be toppled. Later admitting his final effort was a terrible lap Russell ended up second on the grid however and Hamilton third  just 0.005s off his team mate. Bottas starred throughout qualifying Perez settled for fourth but was backed to recover by his team mate as the crowd cheered for the Mexican long after the chequered flag flew while Sainz rounded out the top five more than half a second off the pace. Bottas took P6 to split the Ferraris in a stunning performance for Alfa Romeo while Leclerc settled for seventh 0.780s off pole. That left Norris in eighth with Alpines Alonso ninth and Ocon rounding out the top 10. Verstappen now holds the advantage but not since 2016 has the polesitter won in Mexico City.

Leclerc did improve but not by enough to trouble the top positions which left the focus on the Mercedes drivers after Verstappen then flashed through to improve the best time to a 1m17.775s. Daniel Ricciardo was the highestplaced faller in Q2  the Australian the only driver not to set a personal best on their final flier missing out behind Alonso in the middle segment by just 0.053s. In Q1 Zhous lastgasp improvement knocked out Mick Schumacher  the Haas driver losing his penultimate lap that would have easily been fast enough to get through for cutting the kerbs at Turn 2. Sebastian Vettel ended 17th but behind Schumacher because the younger German driver set his identical 1m20.491s first with Lance Stroll just behind in the other Aston Martin., Home hero Sergio Perez took fourth while Alfa Romeos Valtteri Bottas was a surprise star of qualifying to split the Ferrari drivers and secure sixth on the grid for Sundays race at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez. After Hamilton topped Q1 and Q2 he lost his opening time in Q3 for cutting Turn 3 with Verstappen leading at the head of the times after those first runs in the final segment  his 1m17.947s breaking into the 1m17s bracket for the first time all session. Perez like he had in the first runs led the pack around for the final fliers and he improved with his last go but not by enough to topple his teammate nor Russell who trailed by 0.132 seconds after the opening attempts.

Leclerc did improve but not by enough to trouble the top positions which left the focus on the Mercedes drivers after Verstappen then flashed through to improve the best time to a 1m17.775s. That became the pole lap when Hamilton finally registered a Q3 time that was 0.309s behind Verstappens new best and still not quicker than Russell who lost his final time for sliding off track beyond the Turn 12 exit kerbs entering the stadium but had done enough already to secure second. Valtteri Bottas Alfa Romeo C42 Photo by Mark Sutton  Motorsport Images While the focus was on the frontrunners Bottas slipped in a 1m18.401s having been in the top six in both Q1 and Q2 in a strong showing for Alfa. Behind Leclerc came Lando Norris and Fernando Alonso who completed just a single run in Q3 during the lull between the two efforts completed by all the rest with Esteban Ocon rounding out the top 10 in the other Alpine. Daniel Ricciardo was the highestplaced faller in Q2  the Australian the only driver not to set a personal best on their final flier missing out behind Alonso in the middle segment by just 0.053s. Behind Ricciardo came Zhou Guanyu then the AlphaTauri pair of Yuki Tsunoda and Pierre Gasly  both frustrated by their lack of grip and the latter particularly annoyed to end up out after completing a clean final run. The final driver eliminated in Q2 was Kevin Magnussen who will drop five places on the grid for Sundays race for Haas having to fit a sixth internal combustion engine of the year to his car after it ground to a halt during FP1 with Pietro Fittipaldi aboard. In Q1 Zhous lastgasp improvement knocked out Mick Schumacher  the Haas driver losing his penultimate lap that would have easily been fast enough to get through for cutting the kerbs at Turn 2. Although Schumacher who ended up just behind his gridpenaltyaddled teammate at the end of Q1 set a personal best on his final flier it was 0.8s slower than his deleted previous time and left him vulnerable as the final laps in the opening segment were completed. Sebastian Vettel ended 17th but behind Schumacher because the younger German driver set his identical 1m20.491s first with Lance Stroll just behind in the other Aston Martin. The Williams pair of Alex Albon and Nicholas Latifi brought up the rear of the field with the former the only driver knocked out in Q1 not to set a personal best on his final lap  thanks to an offtrack moment at Turn 8 having had to catch a rear axle slide in the preceding corner.

Mexican Grand Prix Hamilton plays down Mexico GP boos after coming so close to first win of season 30102022 AT 2246 Horner has claimed it will cost Red Bull between 0.25 and 0.5 seconds. The scale of that penalty isnt much more than what you would lose if you were just one place higher up in the championship Mercedes head of trackside engineering Andrew Shovlin told the press. I think describing it as draconian is an exaggeration. Reducing the number of runs does limit your freedom when youre developing your concept but were in reasonably wellexplored regulations now. But you definitely have to be more efficient about it. If it were half a second which Ive heard mentioned then the team at the back of the grid would have a threeseconds advantage to one at the front and that simply isnt the case. But it depends on how well you make decisions during the year. I would have thought a tenth or a bit more than a tenth maybe twotenths is realistically what that will cost you. McLaren team principal Andreas Seidl has also expressed his displeasure at the penalty stating that Red Bull should stop telling fairytales. Ferrari racing director Laurent Mekies feels the punishment is on the lenient side and was particularly unhappy that the 6.07m fine is separate to Red Bulls budget cap spend. We certainly think its low said Mekies. We dont see it on the same scale as to be able to compensate the overspending that was done. Especially combined with the fact that the penalty is not combined with any budget cap reductions for them. So we say altogether what will remain of the real impact of the penalty will probably be very small.

FIA will not deem F1 cars that lose mirrors unsafe after all, https://the-race.com/formula-1/fia-will-not-deem-f1-cars-that-lose-mirrors-unsafe-after-all/, The FIA will not deem Formula 1 cars unsafe if they lose a wing mirror or take action against teams in such circumstances despite the original penalty applied to Fernando Alonso last week. Alonso lost seventh place in the United States Grand Prix after Haas successfully protested his car for being raced in an unsafe condition. Alonso gets US GP seventh place back as penalty overturned Read moreThis was because the Alpine had been driven with its right wing mirror flapping after an airborne crash until the mirror broke off completely. Ahead of the Mexican Grand Prix though the FIA has held talks with the teams and appears to have been convinced that this should not be considered unsafe. They are optimistic that minor damage will be accepted while continuing to assess damaged cars and then apply the blackandorange flag if required., The FIA will not deem Formula 1 cars unsafe if they lose a wing mirror or take action against teams in such circumstances despite the original penalty applied to Fernando Alonso last week. Alonso lost seventh place in the United States Grand Prix after Haas successfully protested his car for being raced in an unsafe condition. Alonso gets US GP seventh place back as penalty overturned Read more This was because the Alpine had been driven with its right wing mirror flapping after an airborne crash until the mirror broke off completely. When the stewards made their judgement they cited FIA technical delegate Jo Bauer calling a flapping mirror unsafe and that the car was unsafe to be driven with a mirror missing while the FIAs head of singleseater matters Nikolas Tombazis was said to have agreed that the car was not safe in that condition. Alonsos penalty was eventually overturned as after an initially unsuccessful protest of its own Alpine successfully petitioned a review of the Haas protest and the stewards said it should not have been admitted as it missed a deadline to be filed. However this was effectively a technicality and the original stewards decision appeared to stand  indicating that in the future cars with broken mirrors would either need to retire or pit until they could be fully repaired. Ahead of the Mexican Grand Prix though the FIA has held talks with the teams and appears to have been convinced that this should not be considered unsafe. The original Haas protest against Alpine was triggered by frustration with inconsistent application of the blackandorange flag as Haas felt it had been unfairly forced to pit in three races this year for minor front wing endplate whereas Alonso  and Red Bulls Sergio Perez  were able to race on in the United States Grand Prix with damage. Teams have been told that the FIA will be more selective with the use of that flag and The Race understands that after discussions it has been agreed that damage like the front wing endplate or indeed the mirror does not meet the threshold to be a safety concern. The failings exposed yet again in FIAs F1 penalty Uturn Read more Alpine sporting director Alan Permane said there had been very positive discussions with the FIA technical department and that they agreed things have gone too far. From here onwards small damages like the mirror like the front wing endplate if its nonstructural like a brake duct  something like that will not be considered to be a black and orange flag offence said Permane. This is still ongoing and Im sure at the technical advisory committee and the sporting advisory committee well discuss it more but a line in the sand has been drawn. This means while Haas ultimately lost its protest it has succeeded in forcing a reckoning on what constitutes an unsafe car. Asked by The Race about the difference between the new position and what the stewards reported from the FIA officials in Austin Permane said I dont want to speak for Jo or Nikolas but what our discussion yesterday was and weve had some texts from them this morning specifically saying the loss of a mirror wouldnt be considered a black and orange flag. I think if we adopt these guidelines from Mexico onwards weve got a sensible place. Gary Anderson F1 should have more penalties like Alonsos Read more Other teams have indicated that the talks since Austin have provided clarity on the matter. They are optimistic that minor damage will be accepted while continuing to assess damaged cars and then apply the blackandorange flag if required. Ferraris sporting director Laurent Mekies said What matters is that we have an understanding of what is and isnt OK. We move on with that understanding and we can have a consistent application of the regulations and everybody knows what the limit is. Hopefully its a clearer situation which has been defined yesterday which is good news. The overarching element is for the FIA for whenever they see something unsafe still dont want to have parts flying off the car and hitting somebody else we are sure they will keep their finger on the button in that case to keep us at bay. Mercedes trackside engineering director Andrew Shovlin said We dont want black and orange flags every race because weve survived a lot of years where they were used correctly and infrequently and we do need to just let the drivers get on with driving and not be too afraid of getting near another car.

Verstappen expects “a lot of crashes” when F1 ditches tyre blankets, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/verstappen-expects-a-lot-of-crashes-when-f1-ditches-tyre-blankets/10391253/, Of course I also had the hardest compound but I think theres a lot more to it. If we have the tyre blankets anyway why dont we just use them to the fullest because theyre there Max Verstappen Red Bull Racing talks to the press Photo by Mark Sutton  Motorsport ImagesYou either go just full blankets or zero not middle way because we have them already. I think were going to have a lot of crashes. Your tyre pressures are going to go through the roof so your tyres are going to degrade a lot more., F1 has been toying with the idea of outlawing tyre blankets since the switch to 18 inch wheels was finalised with that originally set to go ahead in 2021 before the COVID19 pandemic forced the new car regulations to be delayed until 2022. The series had already elected against a complete tyre blanket ban for 2021 back in 2019 with the phasing out of the warmers taking place gradually. Teams are currently permitted to a maximum tyre warmer temperature of 70 degrees Celsius this year down from 100 last year with that maximum level dropping to 50 in 2023 before a full ban in 2024. Two 2023 Pirelli tyre tests have taken place in the FP2 sessions at the United States and Mexican GPs when teams ran to the 50degree setting which Verstappen said was not enjoyable. Asked ahead of this weekends Mexican Grand Prix what his thoughts are on the incoming tyre blanket ban in 2024 the Red Bull driver expects the rule change to cause chaos on track. Yes it was not enjoyable Verstappen said of the Austin tyre test. I drove on tyres that were warmed to 50 degrees I think it was and I almost spun in the pitlane already. Of course I also had the hardest compound but I think theres a lot more to it. If we have the tyre blankets anyway why dont we just use them to the fullest because theyre there Max Verstappen Red Bull Racing talks to the press Photo by Mark Sutton  Motorsport Images You either go just full blankets or zero not middle way because we have them already. We dont need to buy new ones. I think were going to have a lot of crashes. That I know already compared to what we have at the moment. But yeah its tough. Also your tyre degradation is going to be completely different because your tyres are very cold. You are sliding around a lot in the first few laps. Your tyre pressures are going to go through the roof so your tyres are going to degrade a lot more. At the moment I dont really enjoy it but a lot of drivers say the same and we have to find a solution to that. Austin is still a track where you can easily switch on the tyres because of the high speed cornering. But if you go to like a track like a street circuit or Monaco can imagine you on like halfhalf conditions. I think is going to take like half of the race before you have like temperature on your tyres. Verstappen also hit back at suggestions outlawing tyre blankets could make the overcut pitstop strategy in races more powerful as is the case in GT racing. You have a lot less power in a GT car the Red Bull driver added. I think with these F1 cars they are very heavy as well. I mean Ive tried it and its just really almost impossible to drive. And I also drive still in my private time. I drive a GT3 car with no tyre blankets but these cars are a lot more forgiving and its a lot easier to manage than these kind of F1 cars because if you go on power a little bit too much with the power you have from the engine it can be a big big crash.

Ahead of the Mexican Grand Prix the 33yearold West Aussie opened up about the mental turmoil he has endured while failing to find form at McLaren where he has been dropped for 2023 and talks of how revealed he now needs a break from the sport next year to rebuild himself. Ricciardo who will be replaced at McLaren by countryman Oscar Piastri next season said last years trying circumstances and poor results had forced him to retreat into his shell. My confidence was being eaten away driving a car that wouldnt dance with me and would bite back Ricciardo said. Whenever we thought we found a solution along would come another set of challenges. When you put so much into something and it doesnt work out there is sadness. It gets to you. Last year it affected me a little bit too much. I wouldnt be my usual bubbly self. I would be reluctant if someone said lets go out for dinner. I would need some cajoling. I let it get to me. I started to speak to a psychologist last year  the most challenging year I have had. Racing is very much resultsdriven and dictates your Sunday happiness. I was neglecting friendships and thought it would be good to talk to someone to make sure the two sides of my life didnt cross over. Its like all things you need perspective. And with the calendar being so long it was hard to remove yourself from what was happening in the racing.

It is fair to say it was unexpected given I was on a threeyear deal that had a year to run he said. It is not something you can prepare for. But Id already had some honest discussions with Andreas Seidel team principal and Zak Brown chief executive earlier in the year to see what we could do to improve things. It was a concern on both sides. I didnt want to keep coming 14th or 15th. I kept the faith that something would click. But it hadnt happened by midseason and they took the decision they did. It put me in a tough position of thinking what next Ricciardo said he was looking forward to the chance to come back in 2024 with a spring in my step after what looms as a hiatus year next season.

But as time has gone on it has become clearer I do want a little distance from the sport though I do want to stay in touch. Its about getting enough space to rebuild myself. I dont want to get too deep. I am not on a voyage of selfdiscovery. But taking some time off going on some journeys and adventures will help. Ricciardo has welcomed plenty of support starting with Heidi Berger left his girlfriend of three years. She is the daughter of former Formula One driver Gerhard Berger. Some of the older drivers were helpful when McLaren decided I was going and made kind comments privately or publicly he said. Sebastian Vettel was outstanding. We had a lot of chats oneonone. Lewis Hamilton was good too.

Sky Sports News F1 reporter Craig Slater explains the extent of Red Bulls punishment after accepting a breach of the cost cap rules. Red Bull have been handed a 7 million fine and restrictions on car development time for breaching last seasons Formula 1 cost cap. Following over two weeks of speculation and criticism from rivals after a minor breach of the 145m limit in Max Verstappens maiden titlewinning campaign Red Bull were given their punishments on Friday at the Mexico City GP after reaching an accepted breach agreement ABA with the FIA. The ABA meant Red Bull had to admit their wrongdoing  with the team 2.2m over the cap after inaccurately excluding or adjusting a number of costs  but crucially brought with it an end to an F1 saga and less severe punishments. The FIA acknowledged if a tax credit had been correctly applied Red Bull would have only been 0.5m over. There is no accusation or evidence that Red Bull has sought at any time to act in bad faith dishonestly or in a fraudulent manner nor has it wilfully concealed any information from the Cost Cap Administration read an FIA statement. Red Bull have received both a financial and a minor sporting penalty with a 10 per cent reduction in wind tunnel time over the next 12 months most damaging.

Christian Horner claims that for Red Bull to be accused of fraudulent activity is shocking as he responds to Zak Browns letter. Red Bull were already set to have less time in their wind tunnel  where F1 teams test and perfect aerodynamics on their car  than their rivals due to winning this years constructors championship which they wrapped up last weekend in the USA to follow up Verstappens second drivers title. There is a sliding scale of wind tunnel runs in F1 depending on where a team finishes. With their penalty Red Bull are set to have 25 runs in their wind tunnel next season instead of 28. Ferrari by reference will have 30 runs if they finish second in the championship and Mercedes 32 should they end up third as expected. The constructor in last place has 46 runs. Sky Sports F1 pundit Martin Brundle however said earlier this week that Red Bull could be hit with a 25 per cent reduction in wind tunnel time so some may believe they have got away lightly. The 7m fine is not a reduction in their budget cap for next year which is 135m. Aston Martin meanwhile were also given their punishment on Friday for their procedural breach. The team have been handed a 450000 fine for failing to file accurate full year reporting documentation in respect of 2021. Williams took a fine for a similar breach earlier this year. How did Red Bull go over the limit Red Bull were first accused of a minor breach  an overspend of less than five per cent 7.25m  of F1s newfor2021 cost cap on October 10 and had been in discussions with the FIA since that revelation. The team  amid cheating accusations from McLaren boss Zak Brown and fierce criticism from other rivals  have protested their innocence throughout. Red Bull drivers Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez left and right and team boss Christian Horner 1.7m of their 2.2m overspend has been revealed to be owing to tax issues. It has now been confirmed by the FIA that Red Bull made errors on budget cap costs such as catering social security contributions apprenticeship levies unused spare parts for the car and charging certain costs to Red Bull Power Trains. The FIA pursued an ABA first as per the financial regulations and Red Bull effectively entering a plea bargain ruled out the more severe punishments for a minor breach such as points deductions or a reduction of future caps. In already hugely controversial circumstances Verstappen only beat Lewis Hamilton by eight points for last years drivers crown.

Christian Horner denies that Red Bull have gained any advantage from any cost cap breach and believes the relevant costs are within the cap. If Red Bull had rejected the FIAs terms the case would have gone to the cost cap adjudication panel and the full range of penalties would have been back on the table. After that it could have even escalated to the International Court of Appeals a dragging out of the scandal no one wanted. Analysis Red Bull still feel this is a tough sanction Sky Sports News Craig Slater This is Red Bull saying We accept we are in error we overspent and the FIA have delivered the sanction. Its less of a sanction than a lot of people have been talking about. The wind tunnel reduction of 10 per cent is a lot less than a lot of people were speculating it could have been 25 per cent. My understanding from some soundings within the team is that Red Bull still feel this is quite a tough sanction given they were only slightly over the cap. In the runup to all of this there has been some quite strong words exchanged behind the leading teams  we had Toto Wolff Ferrari and then Zak Brown weighing in on this. In a leaked letter Brown equated breaking the cost cap with cheating. But the FIA statement addresses talk of cheating by saying There is no accusation or evidence that RBR has sought at any time to act in bad faith dishonestly or in a fraudulent manner nor has it concealed wilfully any information from the cost cap administration. And that has been pretty consistent throughout as far as the FIA is concerned. Lets see what the other teams make of this. They cannot appeal this but it wont stop them talking about it.

Regarding the Red Bull penalties Wolff added I think any reduction in windtunnel time is going to be detrimental. Wolff agreed that todays outcome will serve as a suitable deterrent for other teams and help to ensure that the cost cap will be respected in future. Toto Wolff Team Principal and CEO Mercedes AMG Photo by Simon Galloway  Motorsport ImagesAsked for his thoughts on Christian Horners explanation of why Red Bull was over the cap Wolff said Nine teams complied with the regulations and stayed below the cap. Wolff praised the FIA for overseeing the cost cap process and ensuring that Red Bull received a stiff penalty suggesting that the outcome showed that nothing was brushed under the carpet., It was announced today that Red Bull had signed an Accepted Breach Agreement with the governing body. As a result it has been docked 10 of its aero testing for 12 months from now and fined 7 million. I think as for any penalty for us its too little Wolff told Autosport. For them it will be too much. Regarding the Red Bull penalties Wolff added I think any reduction in windtunnel time is going to be detrimental. How detrimental is difficult to judge at this stage. I think in absolute terms 7m is a lot of money. But maybe in the bigger scheme of things for Red Bull considering the investment they do on the power unit side and on the team its not. Wolff agreed that todays outcome will serve as a suitable deterrent for other teams and help to ensure that the cost cap will be respected in future. I think that the sum of the penalties is a deterrent the sporting penalty and to a lesser degree the financial fine. But reputational damage that is happening is probably the biggest thing and no team will want to come anywhere near that because obviously we are living in a transparent and compliant world. Our shareholders or our partners demand compliance and in that respect thats just not on anymore. Toto Wolff Team Principal and CEO Mercedes AMG Photo by Simon Galloway  Motorsport Images Asked for his thoughts on Christian Horners explanation of why Red Bull was over the cap Wolff said Nine teams complied with the regulations and stayed below the cap. This is a sport of marginal gains and everything else is just chatter. Theres no mitigating factor. Wolff praised the FIA for overseeing the cost cap process and ensuring that Red Bull received a stiff penalty suggesting that the outcome showed that nothing was brushed under the carpet. What I take as a positive is the strong governance he added. Nothing was brushed under the carpet. The FIA stood by the process. And I think that although the administration has only been in place for 10 months its very encouraging to see things executed. Thats the really positive of the process. Mohammed Ben Sulayem with a strong group of individuals Federico Lodi head of financial regs Shaila Ann Rao interim secretary general for sport and Nikolas Tombazis singleseater technical head ensured that the assessment and the policing of the cost cap was robust. And that is what I take as a positive out of the whole process. What we need to tidy up is the minor and major breaches. I think a breach is a breach. And thats how it should be handled.
Aussie Formula 1 prodigy Jack Doohan laments loss of Daniel Ricciardo for 2023 season, https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/f1/aussie-formula-1-prodigy-jack-doohan-laments-loss-of-daniel-ricciardo-for-2023-season-c-8695234, Daniel Ricciardos McLaren exit may have offered another young Aussie speed demon a golden Formula 1 opportunity but another rising racing prodigy has lamented the loss of one of the sports role models. By the time Ricciardo attempts to make a return to the grid in 2024 there may well be three Aussies in the field after Jack Doohan continued his remarkable rise through the ranks.

By the time Ricciardo attempts to make a return to the grid in 2024 there may well be three Aussies in the field after Jack Doohan continued his remarkable rise through the ranks. The 19yearold made his practice debut in Mexico behind the wheel for Alpine where he is an Academy driver on Saturday morning. Son of fivetime legendary MotoGP champion Mick Doohan slotted into Esteban Ocons seat for the opening practice session of the Mexico City Grand Prix as the paddock took a gander at the rising stars of racing. Doohan recorded the 19th fastest time and put himself in a prime position to take the reserve driver spot previously occupied by fellow countryman Oscar Piastri. Doohans rise through the ranks has been inspired by legends such as his father and Michael Schumacher who kickstarted his karting career but he also told Sky Sports he was disappointed Ricciardo did not have a seat for next season. Theres a lot of sadness for Daniel. Hes been the sole Australian on the grid for many years now since Mark left he said. A lot of people are devastated. Theyre really behind Daniel his character inside and outside the car and the enthusiasm he brings to the paddock and the fans is really good for our sport. Hopefully Ricciardos time off is for the right reasons and he can come back in a year or two and it will be for the better. Doohan revealed he attempted to follow in his fathers footsteps but a broken leg convinced him to stick to four wheels.

Credit Chris Graythen  Getty Images I broke my leg when I was five riding bikes  I think that scared me Doohan said. So I kind of stepped aside from the bike and went towards four wheels for a couple of years because one of my buddies was driving a kart. Id had a kart luckily gifted to me by Michael Schumacher because he and dad were quite close friends they were neighbours in Monaco. He came one time to our home in Australia and we had a kart track there so he gifted myself and my sister a gokart for I think  my third birthday it was quite cool. Once I was seven I got back on the four wheels and Im quite thankful for it obviously because Im way too big and wide to be on two wheels. Ricciardos practice sessions continued the disappointing trend of the season finishing 11th fastest in FP1 fifth slowest of the regular drivers. FP2 was not much better with both McLarens outside the top 12.
Alpine’s protest regarding Alonso penalty ruled inadmissible, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.alpines-protest-regarding-alonso-penalty-ruled-inadmissible.513rj0hWXR5ZqlAUHFrCo5.html, The FIA Stewards have ruled that Alpines protest over Haass postrace dispute in Austin is not admissible  but the French manufacturers have requested a right of review over the case. On Sunday night in the United States Haas lodged a protest on the grounds that Alonso and Sergio Perezs cars were in an unsafe condition after separate incidents for those drivers. Perez was not sanctioned but Alonso was given a 30second postrace penalty in Austin as his car was not deemed to be in a safe condition after he had collided with Lance Stroll. The twotime champion was therefore demoted from seventh to 15th. Alpine then disputed Haass protests on the grounds that they had been lodged too late  24 minutes past the specified deadline  but the FIA concluded in Mexico City that there is no ability or right for any party to protest a decision of the Stewards nor against a summons to a hearing., The FIA Stewards have ruled that Alpines protest over Haass postrace dispute in Austin is not admissible  but the French manufacturers have requested a right of review over the case.

Mercedes have endured a hugelydisappointing campaign following the introduction of new design regulations and saw their eightyear streak of constructors championships officially ended on Sunday as Red Bull added the title to Max Verstappens second successive drivers crown. After an encouraging display in Austin whether or not Mercedes can win one of the final three races  starting in Mexico this weekend  has been a hot topic of discussion but the seventime world champion is not confident. Hamilton pointed to the fact that his strong race performance was aided by being boosted to third on the grid because of penalties for Ferraris Charles Leclerc and Red Bulls Sergio Perez. I think we really need to be realistic Hamilton said. The Red Bull car has been the fastest car by far all year and it is still the fastest car.

It was great to start third and be in a position to fight but on true pace they were ahead of us today and they will be the next three races.

Hamilton is aiming to break the tie with Michael Schumacher in his 16th campaign this year. His hopes of victory in Austin were further boosted when Verstappen was held stationary for 11 seconds during his second and final pit stop which saw the Red Bull driver drop around seven seconds behind the Brit with Leclerc also between them.

The porpoising the breaking the floors because they were hitting the ground and to figure that out during the year when you also have very limited testing was super difficult. Also to do it within the budget cap such a big challenge and theyve really made great progress.

I have not a put a limit on it to be honest he said on Thursday when asked how long he would stay in F1. There are a lot of great things that are being put in place like I just launched the production company this week but I feel great in my body and mind. So I think Im just in a happy place in my life a lot more grounded. So its just a lot better setup allround and I feel like I can take the team to more championships., MEXICO CITY  Lewis Hamilton is planning to stay on the Formula One grid until at least 2025 after opening talks with Mercedes about a contract extension. Hamiltons current deal is due to expire at the end of next season but he has made clear that he has no plans to retire at the end of 2023. Instead the seventime world champion is looking to sign a new multiyear deal which would keep him in Formula One until at least 2025 and possibly beyond. I have not a put a limit on it to be honest he said on Thursday when asked how long he would stay in F1. Im planning to do a multiyear deal with my team. I really dont know what the next five years ... I think were still trying to work on that. There are a lot of great things that are being put in place like I just launched the production company this week but I feel great in my body and mind. So I want to continue I think theres more stuff for us to achieve together so I want to be here longer I just dont know. If Fernando leaves maybe Ill have to think about it twice because Ill be the oldest driver then Hamilton now 37 previously said he had no plans to race into his 40s but now points to various projects outside of F1 including his charitable foundation Mission 44 as added impetus for staying in the sport. Its been lingering around this narrative of me winding towards the end of my career he added. Im sure for all of you in your careers and your jobs you probably have to analyze whats next Is there someone else you want to go Is there somewhere higher you want to be Is there room for growth in that role I think that was perhaps something for me. Being a racing driver is a great thing but I was trying to see How am I going to grow beyond this role And I think youre seeing that with the work were doing with Ignite Ive got Mission 44 now Toto Wolff has been a great leader and enabled me to do things. He said to me in the past when Niki Lauda would say to him How do you let him do this and then eventually theyre all coming round to the idea that supporting and enabling people to be their best is better for everybodys interest. So I think Im just in a happy place in my life a lot more grounded. Ive got my home that I get to spend time in in the UK when I come to see the team for example and the family come down. So its just a lot better setup allround and I feel like I can take the team to more championships.

The Constructors Cup was clinched by Verstappens Red Bull Racing team at Circuit of the Americas outside Austin Texas this past weekend. Now comes Sundays Mexican Grand Prix and it seems theres not much left to race for except bragging rights. Well actually theres a lot left to race for at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez such as can Charles Leclerc and Ferrari salvage some pride and finish second in the driver standings or can Sergio Perez make it a Red Bull 12 on the season. Perez is out to become the first home driver to win the Mexican Grand Prix while his illustrious teammate is also in search of his 14th win on the season which no F1 driver has ever accomplished Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel hold the record at 13. Obviously a win at his home Grand Prix would go a long way for Perez  known as Checo to his friends and fans  clinching the first runnerup position to Verstappen. Leclerc currently holds a twopoint advantage on Perez. And while it is a case of too little too late the upgrades Mercedes unleashed at the COTA made them very racy indeed so expect Lewis Hamilton and teammate George Russell to not go quietly into the night in these final three races of the calendar.

It is by far the highest elevation the F1 circus will compete at on the 2022 calendar year Interlagos Brazil is the next highest at 4921 feet and as can be imagined the thin air causes issues for not just the drivers but also the cars. It should be a track the Ferraris excel at considering the thinner air means that cars carrying more downforce will suffer less of a penalty and cars with a horsepower advantage may find it harder to breath in that thin air. The signature feature of the track is Turn 17 the Peraltada a banked extremely fast corner that brings the field back to the extremely long front straight. This is also the second of the two DRS zones on the track setting up for dragrace finishes to Turn 1. The first DRS zone is at the exit of the Turn 11 chicane to Turn 12 which is very short. Strategies in the past have seen a onestopper be the winning formula with cars starting on the hardest compound being good 50 laps or more then switching to a softer compound for the sprint to the finish. Whether that compound will be the intermediate or the super soft remains to be discovered by the teams during open practices on Friday and Saturday ahead of Saturdays qualifying. Past races has seen the intermediate last up to 30 laps so that would mean a pit window strategy somewhere in the 20s with the hard compounds then being slipped on for the remainder of the scheduled 71 laps. Or do you go with the super softs hope to get at least 20 laps then go to the hard compounds Red Bull Racing has proven to be adept at saving its tires most likely due to the fact that the cars seem to be running far less downforce than Ferrari and other challengers so perhaps this will be the roll of the dice team principal Christian Horner takes at Mexico City.

The intent of pursuing legal action through the UK NCP is to force the issue to the OECD which then may take action against F1. Part of the impetus behind the sport implementing a human rights policy was because of a previous complaint made by the NCP and Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei director of advocacy at Bird hoped this too would provoke action from F1.

It appears that Formula One has taken the decision to disengage with any stakeholders in violation of their own policy and has estranged themselves from all experts who attempt to warn them about the serious human rights risks posed by their activities in Bahrain he said. Our repeated attempts to engage with F1 have fallen on deaf ears particularly since 2021 only to later learn that in the wake of Bahrains horrific human rights abuses they had been busy awarding the regime with the longest contract in motor racing history. We are now escalating the matter by taking it before the UK NCP. Next year Bahrain is set to hold the opening race of next season and its only preseason test but criticism of the regime is intensifying. The Human Rights Watch group is to publish a report next week entitled You Cant Call Bahrain a Democracy Bahrains Political Isolation Laws. It will document the Bahraini governments use of political isolation laws and other tactics to keep activists and opposition members out of public office and public life in what are described as further human rights abuses. Bahrain has spent the last decade cracking down on peaceful opposition and the political isolation laws are yet another example of the governments repression expanding into new spheres said Joey Shea Middle East and North Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch. These draconian laws have made a mockery of Bahrains upcoming parliamentary elections which can neither be free nor fair when you make any political opposition essentially illegal.

We have always been clear with all race promoters and governments with which we deal worldwide that we take violence abuse of human rights and repression very seriously.

A protest by Alonsos Alpine team against the decision to demote him out of the points after he finished seventh in a damaged car will be heard on Thursday. Alonso wrote on Instagram It is an important day for the sport as this decision will dictate if we are going in the right direction. Alonso said his post was in response to messages of support since the penalty. He thanked those who had contacted him on social media adding Its one of those rare times in sport that I feel we are all on the same page and share the same opinion towards rules and regulations. Alonso said after the race that he considered his drive one of the best of his career after he crashed at 180mph his car did a wheelie hit a wall he pitted for a new front wing resumed at the back and climbed to seventh despite damaged aerodynamic parts. The twotime champion has questioned the decisionmaking of officials on a number of occasions this year and his frustrations about the inconsistency of policing of action on track are shared by the majority of his fellow drivers. At the Spanish Grand Prix he accused the FIA of incompetence and lacking knowledge of racing. Criticism of the FIAs running of F1 has been a theme this year and the US Grand Prix was the race after the governing body angered drivers by allowing a recovery vehicle on track in conditions of poor visibility during heavy rain. Alpines appeal will be heard at 1800 Mexico City time 1200 BST on 27 October before this weekends Mexican Grand Prix. The team have questioned the US GP stewards decision to allow a protest by the Haas team despite it being posted after the permitted time limit had expired. The stewards said in their decision to hand Alonso a 30second penalty on Sunday that the Spaniards car was in an unsafe condition because he drove it for some time with a damaged wing mirror and then without one when it fell off. Haas pointed out their cars have previously been given the blackandorange warning flag  demanding a car is pitted for repairs  on three occasions in similar situations this season. At no point during the race were Alpine asked by officials to pit the car and remove the mirror despite calls from Haas to race control. The stewards ruling suggests that any car missing a rearview mirror after an incident will be forced to retire in future. There are also questions about the consistency of decisionmaking after stewards rejected a similar protest by Haas against Sergio Perezs Red Bull. Perez drove some laps with a damaged front wing part of which then fell off the car while he was running.

Ricciardo gives update on 2023 F1 reserve role chances, https://the-race.com/formula-1/ricciardo-gives-update-on-2023-f1-reserve-role-chances/, Daniel Ricciardo says talks are ongoing about a potential Formula 1 reserve driver role in 2023 as he works to lay the foundations for a racing return in 2024. But Ricciardo says emphatically that he does not have a deal in place even though he is working on the possibility. I dont he said when asked by The Race if he has a reserve driver role lined up for next season. This would fit in with a reserve role is it would allow him to attend some races and potentially take what limited testing opportunities are available. Ovals scare me said Ricciardo when asked why he does not plan to race in IndyCar if he cant get an F1 seat., Daniel Ricciardo says talks are ongoing about a potential Formula 1 reserve driver role in 2023 as he works to lay the foundations for a racing return in 2024. The McLaren driver admitted at Suzuka earlier this month that he wont be on the grid next year but remains determined to continue his F1 career the following season. There were suggestions on Saturday at Austin that he had agreed a reserve deal for next year with one of F1s bigger teams potentially his former employer Red Bull. But Ricciardo says emphatically that he does not have a deal in place even though he is working on the possibility. I dont he said when asked by The Race if he has a reserve driver role lined up for next season. For now everythings just rumours. Am I talking Yes but theres no pen on paper or anything like that. Any reserve role Ricciardo takes would likely have to be with one of F1s big three teams especially given F1s fourth and fifth placed teams  Alpine and McLaren  rejected him for 2023. Somethings up. This isnt normal  Ricciardo interview Read more A move into the Red Bull camp would be a surprise given he left there at the end of 2018 and the team would not have a race seat vacancy before 2025 given the twoyear deal Sergio Perez agreed earlier this year. Mercedes and Ferrari could potentially have capacity for Ricciardo as a reserve although the former is the only team that could have a race seat space in 2024 given Lewis Hamilton is out of contract at the end of next year. However recent indications are that Hamilton is keen to continue in the longer term. Ricciardo also confirmed that he expects to still be around in F1 next season given his determination to make a comeback in the future. This would fit in with a reserve role is it would allow him to attend some races and potentially take what limited testing opportunities are available. I will still be around because I still have ambitions for 2024 so I wont completely disconnect from the sport he said. But obviously nothings guaranteed for 24. I dont have a seat that I can say Im going to definitely be driving but Ill still be around and trying to put work in to be back. Could Ricciardo really return to F1 after a 2023 sabbatical Read more Ricciardo also stressed that even with uncertainty about 2024 Im better off sticking to the plan I have and aiming for something else next year rather than pursuing a race seat next year with Haas the only team yet to have confirmed its second driver. He has said repeatedly that his sole focus is F1 and that he has no intention of racing in other categories next season. But he specifically ruled out the possibility of making a move into IndyCar fulltime seemingly for the long term given he says he does not want to race on ovals. Ovals scare me said Ricciardo when asked why he does not plan to race in IndyCar if he cant get an F1 seat. My Formula 1 careerslashambition is not over so thats really first and foremost. 10 F1toIndyCar moves Grosjean can learn from Read more I dont want to deviate I would say primarily for that reason. But also ovals no. Ten years ago I would have said yes but Im OK to admit that Im not OK with ovals. He said that while racing in IndyCar on a roadstreet course programme as old F1 rival Romain Grosjean did in 2021 before expanding to a full season this year does look fun he has not entertained the possibility because of his focus on F1. He added that the romanticising part of it America and all that would be fun but its more of a fantasy.

What the US GP starting grid should look like, https://the-race.com/formula-1/us-gp-starting-grid/, Five Formula 1 drivers in the United States Grand Prix field have now taken grid penalties including two of the frontrunners while another will start from the pitlane. Similar penalties mean Fernando Alonsos Alpine goes from ninth to 14th and Zhou Guanyus Alfa Romeo falls from 14th to 19th. Using the empty grid method officially outlined by the FIA earlier this week this is what we anticipate the starting order to be  subject to any further parts changesLikely US GP starting grid1. Lance Stroll Lando Norris Valtteri Bottas and Alex Albon in fifth through eighth on the revised grid are the other drivers picking up two places from the penalties. Fifth for Aston Martin driver Stroll is not only his best grid position of this year but his best since his 2020 Turkish GP pole., Five Formula 1 drivers in the United States Grand Prix field have now taken grid penalties including two of the frontrunners while another will start from the pitlane. Ferrari loses out on a frontrow sweep as a double penalty for taking a sixth internal combustion engine and sixth turbocharger  both three over the limit for the season  drops Charles Leclerc from second to 12th. But Red Bull loses a car from the front two rows too as a new internal combustion engine means Sergio Perez drops from fourth to ninth. Similar penalties mean Fernando Alonsos Alpine goes from ninth to 14th and Zhou Guanyus Alfa Romeo falls from 14th to 19th. Yuki Tsunoda was later given a fiveplace penalty on Sunday for a gearbox change so should have fallen from 15th to 20th though he will move up one place as Esteban Ocon has a pitlane start after Alpine made unapproved component changes.

Fifth for Aston Martin driver Stroll is not only his best grid position of this year but his best since his 2020 Turkish GP pole. Seventh is Bottass best since his Alfa Romeo started from the same spot in Spain in May and eighth is Albons second best start for Williams after his sixth place amid the many penalties in Belgium two months ago. Though Leclercs weekend has been made much tougher by the penalty Ferrari sporting director Laurent Mekies is optimistic about how much ground he can make up on Sunday. Mark Hughes Element that gave Ferrari edge tripped Red Bull up Read more We knew we were coming into this event with a high possibility of that penalty he told Sky Sports F1. We had to get used to that quite a few times this year. So we also know that there is an opportunity to come back to big points. We will be trying to come back through the field. There may be safety cars and opportunities. We do not set any limits for what Charles can do tomorrow in coming back through the field.

Verstappens 13th win this year equals the record for wins in a season held by Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel and was sufficient for Red Bull to clinch the constructors title for the first time since 2013 securing a double after Verstappen clinched the drivers title last time out in Japan.

Is Russell really ‘not at the level’ of his early Mercedes races?, https://the-race.com/formula-1/is-russell-really-not-at-the-level-of-his-early-mercedes-races/, Russell has had a strong first year at Mercedes despite its struggles with the 2022 car with a notably impressive streak of seven races in which he beat Hamilton early in the season. Team boss Toto Wolff reckoned Hamilton should have been two tenths faster than he was which would have given him a bigger buffer to Russell. Hamilton had a grid penalty at Monza where Russell was third and was hobbled by strategy at Zandvoort where Russell took advantage to finish second. Russell has now targeted getting back on the podium before the end of the season as the goal to end his first year with Mercedes in a good way. We obviously had such a good run of form and then Singapore and Japan were just terrible really from my personal performance and everything that went on., George Russell feels he is not at the level that I probably was earlier in the season after his run of qualifying defeats to Formula 1 teammate Lewis Hamilton continued at the United States Grand Prix. Russell has had a strong first year at Mercedes despite its struggles with the 2022 car with a notably impressive streak of seven races in which he beat Hamilton early in the season. He is on course to finish as the lead Mercedes driver in the championship but has been eclipsed by Hamilton in terms of performance since the summer break. Russell has not beaten Hamilton in qualifying since he qualified on pole in Hungary and came into the US GP weekend off the back of two particularly difficult events in Singapore and Japan. He said after qualifying sixth at Austin where he was half a tenth slower than Hamilton that he and the team did not know why he had suffered a tricky couple of races. A brake issue appeared to hamper Russell in qualifying in Singapore while in Japan he was only slightly slower than Hamilton then lost ground because of strategy in a wet grand prix. Mark Hughes Element that gave Ferrari edge tripped Red Bull up Read more We had such a clean run of form and there were no issues no little problems whatsoever with the car Russell told Sky Sports F1 in the US. Then we got to Singapore and had a bit of a problem with the brakes and that was a recurrence in Japan. Here was just a bit more of a smooth qualifying session for me so sort of pleased to get a bit closer to where I was at the start of the year. But definitely I dont quite feel at the level that I probably was earlier in the season. Russells selfevaluation is slightly harsh but there is evidence Hamilton has established an edge as Mercedes car has improved at least over one lap. So even if Russell has struggled slightly more in the car in the second half of the year it is also the case that Hamilton is performing more consistently after a disrupted first part of the campaign in which he was less at ease with the W13 and was also conducting more experimental work. And Hamiltons improved benchmark means that while Russell can get very close to the seventime world champion on his good days he is further away when things go wrong. While there have been some significant qualifying defeats to Hamilton since Belgian Grand Prix Russell has twice lapped within half a tenth of his illustrious teammate and once more by just over a tenth. Russells recent Hamilton deficits Belgian GP  0.273s Dutch GP  0.499s Italian GP  0.018s Singapore GP  1.321s Japanese GP  0.128s United States GP  0.041s At Austin Russells 0.041s deficit was slightly flattered by the fact Hamilton could not improve on his second run when a loose car balance meant Hamiltons lap got increasingly wayward. Team boss Toto Wolff reckoned Hamilton should have been two tenths faster than he was which would have given him a bigger buffer to Russell. Mercedes front wing may need tweaking after FIA exchange Read more But Russells own qualifying performance was still good and he would have taken advantage of Hamiltons failure to improve and beaten him but for a small slide through the final corner. This was a good reward for the effort Russell put into rebuilding his confidence after nearly shunting in Friday practice which he said had left him being off the pace until qualifying started. That sort of sapped a lot of my confidence across all the practice sessions he said. But fortunately from lap one in Q1 I was sort of back to normal ways. This year its not rare to be honest. Especially with the porpoising with the stiffness of these cars its a bit of a diva at the best of times. You kind of always want to have a clean weekend you never want to put the car in the wall or anything and if you ever have a big moment that sort of takes that confidence away it does take a little while to get back to it. Russell has Wolffs full confidence that hes gonna get back there in terms of his comfort in the car and outright performance but in the meantime he has still been scoring good results. He has two podium finishes in the five races since the summer break although different circumstances would likely have meant Hamilton scored those results instead. Hamilton had a grid penalty at Monza where Russell was third and was hobbled by strategy at Zandvoort where Russell took advantage to finish second. Russell has now targeted getting back on the podium before the end of the season as the goal to end his first year with Mercedes in a good way. It feels like an age ago since we were last in that top five said Russell even though it only happened just before the recent Asian doubleheader. We obviously had such a good run of form and then Singapore and Japan were just terrible really from my personal performance and everything that went on. So I want to get back into that groove.
Toto Wolff the Compulsive Perfectionist Behind Mercedes’s Formula 1 Team, https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/10/31/toto-wolff-the-compulsive-perfectionist-behind-mercedes-formula-1-team, Two Formula 1 drivers were killed in the span of three years at Zandvoort in the seventies. Last years Mexican Grand Prix attracted three hundred and seventy thousand spectators. The Dutch Grand Prix was the fifteenth of the season and Mercedess best results so far were a couple of secondplace finishes. Weve not gone from being an eighttimewinning worldchampionship team to not being able to build cars Hamilton said. Under normal circumstances the Grand Prix would have finished behind the safety car with the race order intact., Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. A few minutes before the start of the Dutch Grand Prix which was held last month in baking sunshine at Zandvoort a beachside racetrack within commuting distance of Amsterdam Toto Wolff the principal of the MercedesAMG Petronas Formula 1 team walked out onto the starting grid. A Grand Prix begins when a row of five red lights above the start line is extinguished but for a short time before the track is a twentythousandhorsepower mob scene. Each of the unearthly longnosed machines is attended by a mobile I.C.U. of generators steel trolleys laptops tire blankets and uniformed mechanics in crash helmets and flameproof gear. Umbrellas shroud the drivers cockpits. Billionaires stalk the grid. Race marshals hold clipboards in red gloves. The noise is beyond belief helicopter blades highspeed wheel guns the desperate howls of the cars the massed emanations of the waiting crowd. In Zandvoort loudspeakers laced the sky with dance music. The afternoon was humid the air felt saturated. Wolff was at home. He is tall dark and Austrian. He could pass for a Sacha Baron Cohen character or for someone who breezes past you in the airport smelling good wearing loafers and no socks. He worked the grid in a white shirt emblazoned with the Mercedes star and the logos of twelve other corporate sponsors black pants teamissued Puma sneakers lovable smile. He kissed peoples cheeks touched elbows gave impromptu TV interviews and yelled lastminute thoughts to his drivers. Somewhere in the fumes was death. Two Formula 1 drivers were killed in the span of three years at Zandvoort in the seventies. At one point I found myself by the pit lane when three cars leaped out red taillights flashing. The speed was like a whip. Wolff who is fifty is the best team boss in the recent history of the worlds fastest motorsport. The formula of Formula 1 refers to a set of rules first enshrined after the Second World War to bring some order to the urge to race dangerous cars on the asphalt of foreign cities. Whereas Nascar is all left turns cars that look like cars and spectatorfriendly oval tracks Formula 1 has a madder purer heart the oldest courses date from a century ago. Races last around ninety minutes. They twist sweep and go down hills sometimes on existing streets. The cars which started out as death traps for daredevils are now specimens of extreme technology flying algorithms that fight for advantages of a hundredth of a secondthe distance of a yard over a threemile track. The sport is esoteric but globally so. Last years Mexican Grand Prix attracted three hundred and seventy thousand spectators. The Singapore race runs through the city at night. Drivers can shed six pounds in stress and sweat. The average television audience for a Formula 1 race is around seventy million peoplefour times that of the typical N.F.L. gameand the best drivers earn soccerstar salaries and lasting fame. When Ayrton Senna a threetime world champion was killed in a race in 1994 the Brazilian government declared three days of mourning. A million people waited in the heat to pay their respects and many spoke of their saudadean inexpressible state of longing for something that is gone. And heres where I can tell youll never amount to anything. Facebook Twitter Email Shopping Cartoon by Stephen Raaka Between 2014 when Wolff took charge of Mercedes and 2021 the team won the world championship eight years in a rowan unprecedented achievement. In Formula 1 there is a constructors championship for the most successful team and a drivers championship awarded at the end of some twenty races. Each team has two drivers. Mercedess star is Lewis Hamilton who earned around sixtyfive million dollars last season. During the teams winning streak Hamilton won six individual world titles bringing his career total to seven. No one has ever won eight. I couldnt think of a better friend. I couldnt think of a better boss Hamilton told me of Wolff. Formula 1 is currently surging in popularity particularly in the United States in part because of a Netflix series Drive to Survive which has embroidered the nerdery of the sport with artful camerawork and bitchy insight into the lives of its protagonists. Wolff who speaks five languages and whose wife Susie is a former racing driver is one of the shows natural stars. Of the ten team principals in the sport only Wolff and his archrival Christian Horner a Briton who runs the Red Bull team have ever won a world championship. But unlike Horner and the rest of his peers Wolff is also a coowner of his team. His onethird stake in Mercedes is conservatively valued at around five hundred million dollars. He sees himself simultaneously as a competitor and as someone who is shaping the future of a multibilliondollar business. The other team principals and I dont mean this in an arrogant way are incentivized for performance only Wolff said. His rivals see this. Hes playing a game and he is always one move in advance one of them told me. But this season Wolff and Mercedes have failed to win a single race. The Dutch Grand Prix was the fifteenth of the season and Mercedess best results so far were a couple of secondplace finishes. In 2020 the team won thirteen out of seventeen. Hamilton who joined Formula 1 as a rookie in 2007 has never gone a season without winning at least one race. Ahead of the U.S. Grand Prix in Austin on October 23rd the team was languishing in third place behind Red Bull and Ferrariits worst position in a decade. Seeing Wolff and Mercedes lose their way has been as disconcerting as it has been refreshing like watching Roger Federer shank his serve the Yankees miss the playoffs Simone Biles miss the beam. It is understandable up to a point. Weve not gone from being an eighttimewinning worldchampionship team to not being able to build cars Hamilton said. We just . . . its wrong this year. The ostensible reason was a change in the rules. Every few years the Fdration Internationale de lAutomobile which has overseen Grand Prix racing since 1906 forces the teams to redesign their cars. Normally the official logic has to do with safety or with making it easier for cars to overtake one another but there is almost always an unspoken motive to upset the existing order of things and to stop one team from gaining a permanent advantage. In the past Mercedes profited from these changes adapting faster than its rivals. But the 2022 reset was unusually farreaching. One of the aims of the new rules was to reconfigure the downforce generated by the cars to reduce the amount of dirty air left in their wakes and to allow for closer racing. At a preseason testing event in Bahrain in March Mercedess new carthe W13appeared to embody the boldest interpretation of this idea. It was skinnier and more futuristic than the rest. People were looking at that thinking Wow. Mercedes are going to blow the field away George Russell the teams other driver told me. Within reason we thought that as well. But the W13 proved capricious. Data collected in the wind tunnel or through computer modelling didnt pan out on the track. At high speeds the car bounced an effect known as porpoising. My back is killing me Hamilton yelled on a long straight in Baku in June where the floor of the car repeatedly hit the asphalt at more than two hundred miles per hour. Attempts to resolve the issue only uncovered more problems. Weve tried and tried and failed. And tried and tried and failed Hamilton said. Andrew Shovlin Mercedess tracksideengineering director who has a Ph.D. in the dynamics of military logistics vehicles compared fixing the W13 to peeling an onion. Even the aerodynamic bouncing manifests itself in about three different mechanisms he said. The other reason for Mercedess poor performance was a sense of injustice and doom. In 2021 with five laps remaining in the final race of the season Hamilton was leading the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on his way to an eighth individual world title and solitary greatness. Hamilton had won the previous three races he had the car on a string. He was unbeatable and we were unbeatable Wolff said. On lap fiftythree in Abu Dhabi the race was interrupted by a crash and then a safety car took over. In Formula 1 when there is a hazard on the track a sports car with flashing lights leads a stately jumbled procession of cars until the danger is cleared. Under normal circumstances the Grand Prix would have finished behind the safety car with the race order intact. But the race director an F.I.A. official named Michael Masi made the decision to divert a group of cars to enable a final lap of racing between Hamilton and the secondplace driver Max Verstappen of Red Bull. The drivers were equal in points in the worldchampionship standings. Verstappen was on fresh tires he slipped past Hamilton and took the title. The F.I.A. later concluded that Masi had made a human error and he left his post. But the result stood.
Ricciardo shock return to Red Bull F1, https://thejudge13.com/2022/10/23/ricciardo-shock-return-to-red-bull-f1/, Daniel Ricciardo is currently the second most successful F1 driver in the sport not to win a drivers world title. Yet today the paddock gossip believes Ricciardo is about to announce a return to Red Bull racing. Ricciardo Red Bull returnTed Kravitz revealed during FP3 in Austin Ive got some good news for Daniel Ricciardo fans. So it could be Red Bull are looking to ditch the increasingly distant Perez and replace him in 2024 with their driver of old  Daniel Ricciardo. READ MORE Red Bull F1 future in doubt as owner dies, Daniel Ricciardo is currently the second most successful F1 driver in the sport not to win a drivers world title. Yet having been dismissed by McLaren a year before his contract expires he appears to have no Formula one drive for 2023. The Aussie driver has refused to entertain drives with less competitive F1 teams and has a plan to get back to the front of the Formula One grid. TJ13 has questioned Ricciardos decision making process because the less competitive team seats available for next season will be similar in 2024. Ricciardo nope taking a sabbatical Daniel was asked again about his future during the driver press event in Austin. You will see me around Ricciardo said. Its going to look different for me but there is still very much still a plan in place. So its not that I am checking out and saying see you later its far from that. Im just putting in a plan to honestly try to get me back to the front of the grid and win races and do all the stuff I know I can do. Ricciardo most successful non F1 driver on the grid Apart from the world champions amongst the current crop of F1 drivers only Valteri Bottas has more F1 race wins than Ricciardo with 10 to his name Ricciardo has 8 victorys. Further Bottas wins came during the era where the Mercedes cars was all dominant and Ricciardo has never been in a championship wining car. Even Ferraris superstar driver Charles LeClerc has won just 5 F1 races and his team mate Carlos Sainz scored his one and only F1 race win this season at this seasons British Grand Prix. The other F1 drivers currently on the grid with F1 race wins include Sergio Perez with 4 2 of which have come this season in the all conquering RB18. The remaining GP winner s are Alpha Tauri driver Pierre gassy and Alpines Esteban Ocon with one Formula One grand prix to their names. Year out not the best plan for Daniel Since his sacking by McLaren F1 Ricciardo has talked about having a year out and a reset to refresh his mind before returning to F1 in 2024. The Aussie described his time for the last two seasons at McLaren as a grind and Ricciardo has been linked with Mercedes to become their reserve driver for 2023. When asked about having Ricciardo for a reserve team mate Lewis Hamilton smiled and replied. I think hes far too talented and hes earned the right to be amongst us all racing. If hes part of our team thatd be great but a third role is not really whats best for him. Hamilton wants Ricciardo racing Hamilton added of the eighttime racewinner If I was managing him hed be racing. Riccioardo was asked again about his future during the driver press event in Austin. You will see me around Ricciardo said. Its going to look different for me but there is still very much still a plan in place. So its not that I am checking out and saying see you later its far from that. Im just putting in a plan to honestly try to get me back to the front of the grid and win races and do all the stuff I know I can do. How does Ricciardo return to the front of the grid A return to the front of the grid for Ricciardo is not on the cars given Ferrari have LeClerc and Sainz locked in on deals that run into 2024 and beyond and as do Mercedes with George Russell. Lewis Hamiltons contract expires at the end of 2023 but he has strongly indicated he wants to continue after that. Its inconceivable Mercedes would not make Lewis an offer. Yet today the paddock gossip believes Ricciardo is about to announce a return to Red Bull racing. Ricciardo Red Bull return Ted Kravitz revealed during FP3 in Austin Ive got some good news for Daniel Ricciardo fans. He may not have a race drive for next ear but we do understand he has closed out a reserve driver role next year. So he will be around and about the Formula One paddock next year.. Kravitz added We thought Mercedes would be where Ricciardo goes because they now have a vacancy because Nyck de Vries their current reserve driver is going to Alpha Tauri. But Im told its not Mercedes which only leaves Red Bull who have a reserve driver on hand at every race Sky F1 commentator was negative about the possibility stating  I thought for him hed be better having a clean break and then coming back. Maybe just keeping your foot in the door doing some simulator work is ideal. Trudging around around Formula One tracks not participating takes a pretty old tough mindset. Ricciardo has persistently said he has a plan to return to the front of the grid despite open offers from Gunther Steiner at Haas F1. Sergio Perez no complimentary F1 driving style So it maybe his conversations with Red Bull revolve around replacing Sergio Perez who has a 1 plus 1 year contract with the team that coyly end next year. Should Perez bomb in 2023 the door would be open for Ricciardo to resume as Verstappens team mate. Ricciardo outscored Verstappen over their 3 season together between 201618 with 457 world championship points compared to Verstappens 377. The Aussie also notched 18 podium positions in that time compared to his teammates 11. Both drivers secured three race victories and though Verstappen was usually considered to be quicker over one lap Ricciardo was the more consistent racer  the record is tight when it came to qualifying. Verstappen only led 2120 in that intrateam qualifying battle and Ricciardo scored the only pole during their time together as team mates. RB1819 suits Ricciardo driving style The new Formula one regulations for 2022 saw the RB18 car perform early with plenty of understeer. Perez prefers this kind of driving style and performed well against his team mate Verstappen. Yet as the season has progressed Red Bull have developed the car more towards one which is rear end limited with a precise front end that understeers which is to Verstappens liking. This has seen Sergio fall away in relative terms both during qualifying and the race from the 2022 world champion Max Verstappen. Finally and of note Ricciardo likes an F1 car that performs similarly to the way Verstappen drives. So it could be Red Bull are looking to ditch the increasingly distant Perez and replace him in 2024 with their driver of old  Daniel Ricciardo. READ MORE Red Bull F1 future in doubt as owner dies

Latifi leaves Formula 1 with no regrets - US Sports, https://lookcharms.com/latifi-leaves-formula-1-with-no-regrets/, The Canadian driver is Alexander Albons teammate and despite two years of experience with the team he is dominated by the Thai driver. He was frustrated with his race and his comments did not reflect what he thought of Nyck De Vries race. After three full seasons in Formula 1 the Canadian driver will bid farewell to the discipline after the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. He has no regrets even though he hoped for more from his time in Formula 1. At the end of the day I dont really have any regrets about my approach to Formula 1., The Canadian driver is Alexander Albons teammate and despite two years of experience with the team he is dominated by the Thai driver. Latifis lack of results and the underperformance of Monza or replacement Nyck De Vries surpassed him and scored his first points in Formula 1 in his first race tarnished the results of his season. Affected by this event which played an important role in his ousting from the team. The Canadian spoke about this weekend which was difficult for him at the microphone of the podcast Beyond The Grid he first insisted on the excellent form of the Williams on the Italian track.  Its probably the circuit where we were the most competitive compared to the others Im not going to talk about the strengths of our car because we were very fast on the straights but the reason we were is that we didnt have much support  Latifi also returned to his less than complimentary remarks after the race towards his teammate. He was frustrated with his race and his comments did not reflect what he thought of Nyck De Vries race. It was extremely impressive the car as I said was more competitive there but it was still a difficult car to drive. Afterwards I was frustrated with my race and people misinterpreted what I said. I was frustrated with my race and had a microphone put in front of me right after which nobody really appreciates. I was annoyed by the cars problems and people took my frustration at having had a bad race.  After three full seasons in Formula 1 the Canadian driver will bid farewell to the discipline after the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. He has no regrets even though he hoped for more from his time in Formula 1. There are definitely a lot of things that I will miss but there are also a lot that I wont miss. Im really not one of those people who will be bitter. At the end of the day I dont really have any regrets about my approach to Formula 1. I would have hoped for a lot more it goes without saying.  Logan Sargeant who is currently in Formula 2 is the one who will take Latifis place next season if he obtains his super license at the end of the last Formula 2 meeting in Abu Dhabi.
Mercedes' 2023 'DNA' change will go far beyond sidepods, https://the-race.com/formula-1/mercedes-2023-dna-change-will-go-far-beyond-sidepods/, The teams W13 was blighted by porpoising problems over the first few races of the year preventing Mercedes from understanding the real problems with its 2022 concept. Its no surprise then that there have been hints of a concept shift for Mercedes next year. I think the DNA of the car is going to change for next year thats clear Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff said. Mercedes has chosen its path for 2023 with the hope it can return to F1s title fight and get on par with Red Bull and Ferrari which both usurped it this year. But Mercedes is still in the phase of trying to learn from every upgrade it brings knowing a full concept change midseason in the cost cap era just wouldnt be possible., Its become increasingly clear over the course of the 2022 Formula 1 season that Mercedes solution to the championships new regulations has not worked. Mercedes has gone from eight successive constructors championships to a campaign that could be its first without a win since 2011 while its chief 2021 rival Red Bull has won 16 of the 20 races. The teams W13 was blighted by porpoising problems over the first few races of the year preventing Mercedes from understanding the real problems with its 2022 concept. Mercedes claims its found mistake that doomed its 2022 Read more Mercedes has brought a consistent stream of upgrades to try and improve the pace of the W13 with the latest development a new front wing that it debuted at last weekends Mexican Grand Prix after tweaks to make it legal. It has only scored 10 fewer points than Ferrari in the second half of the year but the team believes its still suffering from a mistake that it traces back to the end of last year  one that it was only able to identify during its postrace analysis of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix in June. Its no surprise then that there have been hints of a concept shift for Mercedes next year. But that could go far beyond a pivot away from its unique zerosidepod design. I think the DNA of the car is going to change for next year thats clear Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff said. It doesnt necessarily mean that the bodywork is going to look very different. But certainly what is part of the DNA of the car will change for next year. This is potentially a change that goes far beyond the sidepod concept and instead covers the underlying architecture of the car its suspension and underfloor. Mercedes fundamental problem in 2022 has been its rear suspension setup which prevents the team from being able to run the W13 at the optimal ride height without the bouncing problems that rattled its drivers to the point of back and chest pains earlier in the season. Mercedes has chosen its path for 2023 with the hope it can return to F1s title fight and get on par with Red Bull and Ferrari which both usurped it this year. I think weve found a path we believe in and a path we can move along and get better technical director Mike Elliott said. F1 is a learning game you never know all the answers and what weve been trying to do is to make sure theres nothing were missing keep digging see if its something else we need to find. Youve got to look and say weve got two fantastic competitors a lot of good competitors but two very strong ones in Ferrari and Red Bull. We need to go into the winter and do a good job and thats the only way well get on par with them and hopefully beat them. Next years car will look different Im not going to say why but it will look different. Dont be fooled by Mexico Mercedes is months behind Red Bull Read more Some of the upgrades Mercedes has brought to the W13 will be irrelevant for its 2023 design not just because of the potential changed concept for next year but because of the new floor rules that change the aerodynamic demands and therefore require a different solution. But Mercedes is still in the phase of trying to learn from every upgrade it brings knowing a full concept change midseason in the cost cap era just wouldnt be possible. Wholesale car concept changes might have been possible for teams in the past but with the new Aerodynamic Testing Allowances limits and the cost cap  which will further reduce next year  Mercedes had no choice but to bide its time until 2023 for a proper change. It has at least benefitted from a bigger ATA during the second half of 2022 after the percentages were reset midway through the season when Mercedes was third behind Ferrari and Red Bull in the constructors championship as it is now. This advantage will help Mercedes claw back what it believes to be a 10month deficit to our main competitors but it remains to be seen whether the concept it has chosen will be the right one. Logic and a look back at the convergence in the years following major F1 rule changes would dictate Mercedes will move its car concept closer to the team with the best solution to F1s new regulations  Red Bull  but we wont know for sure until the car hits the track in Bahrain in February.
Formula 1 | Gasly explains how he will miss 'the world of Red Bull' - US Sports, https://lookcharms.com/formula-1-gasly-explains-how-he-will-miss-the-world-of-red-bull/, The Frenchman is ending an eightyear association with Red Bull as he swaps his AlphaTauri seat for that of Alpine F1. He was then promoted to Red Bull Racing in 2019 but his disappointing spell only lasted 12 races before returning to Faenza. Red Bull gives access to so many industries and so many other sports and athletes explains Gasly.  I have met hundreds of Red Bull athletes from different sports and the experience and knowledge you gain from that is invaluable.  Im going to Red Bull Japan and theyre there for us  you find your feet pretty much anywhere in the world inside Red Bull and thats definitely going to change and Im going to miss that., Pierre Gasly said he will miss the offtrack benefits that come with being a Red Bull driver and that the team is much bigger than what people see in a race. The Frenchman is ending an eightyear association with Red Bull as he swaps his AlphaTauri seat for that of Alpine F1. Gasly first joined the Red Bull group in 2014 as a member of the junior team before becoming a fulltime driver for Toro Rosso in 2018. He was then promoted to Red Bull Racing in 2019 but his disappointing spell only lasted 12 races before returning to Faenza. Red Bull gives access to so many industries and so many other sports and athletes explains Gasly.  What people see is mainly whats going on in the paddock and around Formula 1 but Red Bull is so much bigger than that. Ive talked about it with a few friends  being part of Red Bull you gives access to an incredible world.   I have met hundreds of Red Bull athletes from different sports and the experience and knowledge you gain from that is invaluable.   I will miss adventures and activities Ive flown stunt planes Ive been skydiving Ive surfed in Australia Ive done stuff Ill talk about all my life.  Along with these adventures away from the track Gasly believes Red Bulls presence around the world has been very beneficial to him. I have been seen as a Red Bull athlete everywhere I go for nine years. Red Bull has offices all over the world. go to Red Bull America they welcome me and take care of me.   Im going to Red Bull Japan and theyre there for us  you find your feet pretty much anywhere in the world inside Red Bull and thats definitely going to change and Im going to miss that.   As for AlphaTauri specifically I call them my second family. They gave me my chance in F1 and I have worked with them for several years. They know me and know everything about me my personality and the way I work. Its very natural to work with them.   It hasnt been on my mind yet but for sure Abu Dhabi is going to be emotionally charged knowing that I wont be with them anymore. But I know in my life these are times which I will remember with very very fond memories. 
F1 outcast Daniel Ricciardo drops big hint on plans for 2023 as he can't find driving job, https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-11397361/F1-outcast-Daniel-Ricciardo-drops-big-hint-plans-2023-driving-job.html, Ricciardo could never find his groove at the manufacturer and will be replaced by fellow Australian Oscar Piastri in 2023. Now Ricciardo has started his own Instagram account called daniel3.jpg with the bio reading Thank lando.jpg for this one hes such a trendsetter. So far Ricciardo has posted several images including candid snaps with mates an outoffocus shot of his girlfriend Heidi Berger and some fancy drink orders. Ricciardo has snapped several pictures of CAA employees suggesting there may be more to his new Instagram page than just happy snaps in 2023. The Aussie wont be driving in F1 races next year after deciding to step back from the sport., Aussie F1 champion Daniel Ricciardo has given his fans a sneak peak at what life without racing might look like in 2023  and he has been inspired by his McLaren teammate. Ricciardo could never find his groove at the manufacturer and will be replaced by fellow Australian Oscar Piastri in 2023. He has been unable to secure a drive for next season but has said he could take a year off and mount a comeback in 2024  on top of rumours he could sign on as a reserve driver with a top team like Mercedes or Red Bull. Ricciardo has kicked off his photography career with a new Instagram post and perhaps a new career with a USbased talent agency His McLaren teammate Lando Norris has previously started an Instagram account called lando.jpg where he shares a range of photos he takes around the world. Now Ricciardo has started his own Instagram account called daniel3.jpg with the bio reading Thank lando.jpg for this one hes such a trendsetter. So far Ricciardo has posted several images including candid snaps with mates an outoffocus shot of his girlfriend Heidi Berger and some fancy drink orders. It wouldnt be a Daniel Ricciardo page unless it featured some blokes presumedly his mates doing shoeys in a bar I just started pressing the button Ricciardo captioned the series of photos. What is most telling are the images of Creative Artists Agency which is an American talent and sports agency based in Los Angeles California. Ricciardo has snapped several pictures of CAA employees suggesting there may be more to his new Instagram page than just happy snaps in 2023. And his fans are loving it. Love this now we just kindly wait till daniel3.jpg returns the favors lando.jpg did to the fans one replied. So excited to see more of your life behind a lens posted another. You better take pictures of your extremely beautiful girlfriend or im gonna sue joked another. Ricciardos outoffocus shot of girlfriend Heidi Berger had fans asking for more  and better  images of his new flame Meanwhile the 33yearold has again moved to confirm that there will be no late announcement and he will not be driving in Formula One races in 2023. I can confidently say I wont be on the grid behind a wheel Ricciardo told Sky Sports. But I still want to be in the sport I want to be working with a team still with the ambition to be back on the grid in 24. That said its honestly where my heads at as well. I feel like a bit of time away from a race seat will actually do me good and then try to rebuild on something for 24. Ricciardo offered a possible clue to his future as he posted several shots featuring the Creative Artists Agency which looks after highprofile sports stars Ricciardo snapped pics of random CAA staff and the welcome message at the businesss building for his new Instagram profile Lets say Im not done but itll look a bit different. Ricciardo indicated he needed a break after a difficult season. No doubt the last two years have been quite hard especially when you put a lot in and when it doesnt come back it can get you down he said. As well I know the value of having even like a summer break I know stepping away just gives you a different perspective. The way the seasons are its pretty relentless you dont really get a chance to rebuild. Everyones different but I truly believe that will be in a way a blessing in disguise for me. By doing less Ill achieve more. The Aussie wont be driving in F1 races next year after deciding to step back from the sport. His best bet to stay involved is as a reserve driver possibly with Mercedes or Red Bull Ricciardo planned to stay active to some degree to remain racefit. Im certainly talking to teams but I still obviously want to keep a foot in the door for 2024 he said. Im sure seeing the lights go out in race one Ill already have that itch so I will want to be back in 24.
Formula 1 | F1 promises the 'best show in the world' in Las Vegas… at an affordable price - US Sports, https://lookcharms.com/formula-1-f1-promises-the-best-show-in-the-world-in-las-vegas-at-an-affordable-price/, F1 continues to raise expectations around its next Grand Prix it will be the direct promoter in Las Vegas next year. Liberty Media promises affordable seats for everyoneOn the side of Liberty Media and its manager for F1 Stefano Domenicali we know that Las Vegas will be a key meeting for this Grand Prix where the Americans themselves will be the promoters. Stefano Domenicali promises it Liberty Media will put the necessary means. We are going to put on the biggest show in the world and show the world what F1 is all about. Emily Prazer former head of business development for F1 and now commercial director of Las Vegas is also on the front line for this Grand Prix., F1 continues to raise expectations around its next Grand Prix it will be the direct promoter in Las Vegas next year. It was at the emblematic Caesars Palace that a promotional event was organized this Saturday evening and Liberty Media had provided the means demonstration cars pit stop simulations F1 simulators trophies Lewis Hamilton Sergio Prez George Russell and Alexander Albon were even there they were able to drive their demonstration singleseaters on the Las Vegas Strip and entertain the public. And Lewis Hamilton who gratified the public with a few donuts also had a mishap a false contact on his Mercedes in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip almost made him part of the decor I almost crashed smiled Lewis Hamilton. There was so much smoke and I had no idea where I was. I was completely lost. I couldnt find the buildings so I started backing up and the barrier was right there.  Liberty Media promises affordable seats for everyone On the side of Liberty Media and its manager for F1 Stefano Domenicali we know that Las Vegas will be a key meeting for this Grand Prix where the Americans themselves will be the promoters. Stefano Domenicali promises it Liberty Media will put the necessary means. F1 will have a special positioning for this race. We are going to put on the biggest show in the world and show the world what F1 is all about.  Emily Prazer former head of business development for F1 and now commercial director of Las Vegas is also on the front line for this Grand Prix. You can imagine the pressure on his shoulders She recalls her main challenges not only Liberty Media does not have the experience of promoting races but also the topography of Las Vegas is very special Its one thing to organize a race but its another thing to organize a race that has never happened before especially in a city like Las Vegas. F1 has never sold tickets before they have never promoted an event before.  We are Liberty employees working from offices in Vegas as if we were a promoter but we are working hand in hand with F1 to put on the best event in the world.  Vegas is asking for a completely different model because of the infrastructure the casinos and the customers.  This race is fully supported by Liberty. Our advantage is being an hour and a half from Denver. So from an infrastructure perspective its amazing.  Prazer also promises it the tickets will be sold at an affordable price at least at the first price to allow everyone or almost to smell the smell of F1. We are planning a huge fan festival of 45000 people. We work with casinos to organize  watch parties .  The idea is that between now and November 2023 our only objective is to organize the best race in the world and to make sure that we do not miss this opportunity.  We are planning general admission tickets at affordable prices tickets that will give access to hospitality areas. So we try to make it accessible.  The other thing were trying to do is add value to our tickets and I think well be the first allinclusive race on the calendar. Thus food and beverages with the exception of alcohol for legal reasons will be provided with any type of grandstand ticket purchased.   We think yes Vegas is going to be more expensivebut we also wonder how people can afford the ticket they want or have access to the tickets they want.  From our perspective its about reproducing the feeling that everyone is welcome. There are over 150000 hotel rooms here in Vegas which means theres plenty of space and Vegas appeals to everyone theres the super luxury but theres also the rooms at very good price.  We are still talking about tickets costing up to 100000 dollars MGM Resorts International will offer such a package including hotel nights. Caesars Palace will also offer experiences at 5000 dollars for three nights But for Prazer this is a false debate.  This perception sur les tickets  100 000 dollars is probably based on the ultimate F1 racing experience  which could be organized for big casino customers who are ready to come and lose millions of dollars that weekend.  The thing about Vegas is that there is very low end and very high end. There is something for every taste.  Let it be said Prazer therefore remains confident for the success of its event  Im not as worried about it as some people think.  The level of expectation on the final product has to be taken into account so my biggest stress is making sure we meet that expectation.  I think thats what keeps me up at night. Pressure de Formula 1 and Vegas. With all the news and what everyone is talking about you can feel it.

Formula 1 | F1 Brazilian Grand Prix 2022 presentation and schedule - US Sports, https://lookcharms.com/formula-1-f1-brazilian-grand-prix-2022-presentation-and-schedule/, The Carlos Pace circuit indeed hosts the Brazilian Grand Prix the 21st race of the year. Turns 567  These fast corners especially Turn 6 and Turn 7 are a real test for the tires on the left side. Forces presentUndefeated since the Singapore Grand Prix and winner of eight of the last nine races Max Verstappen will obviously be the favorite for this Grand Prix. Brazilian Grand Prix timetableFor the last time this season F1 is heading to the Americas with evening times for European spectators.  Friday November 11430530 p.m. Free Practice 1800900 p.m. Qualifying Saturday November 12430530 p.m. Free practice 2830900 p.m. Sprint Sunday November 13700 p.m.900 p.m. RaceThe winners of the Brazilian Grand Prix, F1 begins its last two racing weeks of the 2022 season with a penultimate round at Interlagos. The Carlos Pace circuit indeed hosts the Brazilian Grand Prix the 21st race of the year. Although there is no longer any sporting issue in terms of awarding titles we can finally start a Grand Prix without the case of Red Bulls budget ceiling being exceeded being the main subject of discussion. We can thus hope for a weekend focused more on sport but also more relaxed on the track the stakes being lower. The Interlagos circuit could help this animation as could the unstable weather in Brazil this season. The plot in detail Famous for its unpredictable weather twisty tight infield and ability to put on a jawdropping spectacle in title races Interlagos is a legendary circuit on the F1 calendar. Among the fifteen corners the most famous are the first two whose name pays homage to the great Ayrton Senna. Competitors travel it counterclockwise dipping into the S of Senna which leads to the Reta Oposta straight where DRS can be used. The second sector is very rhythmic and technical before the track climbs up the hill to skirt a bustling grandstand. Turn 1  A difficult banked turn at the end of a long straight. Its topology makes it tricky especially since the drivers do their biggest braking here from 330 to just 110 kmh. Turn 2  It is important to get out of turn 1 well to maintain the rhythm in turn 2 the very fast turn 3 and finally the first zone of activation of the DRS. Turn 4  The first zone of DRS activation provides an overtaking opportunity before a fairly fast turn. Turns 567  These fast corners especially Turn 6 and Turn 7 are a real test for the tires on the left side. This is followed by turn 8 which is slower. From turn 2 to the entrance to turn 6 the competitors accelerate for seventeen seconds and only touch the brakes at turn 4. The MGUK recovers energy in the braking zones especially in this intermediate sector. Turn 8  The flat curbs in turns 8 and 10 leave enough freedom to find the best string in those slow turns. Turn 12  Crucial for a fast lap as exit speed conditions hill entry and pit straight. The internal combustion engine will be pushed to its limits with a 40 meter drop between the exit of Turn 12 and the braking point of Turn 1. Pit straight  The second DRS activation zone extends 500 meters here to provide even more overtaking opportunities. Forces present Undefeated since the Singapore Grand Prix and winner of eight of the last nine races Max Verstappen will obviously be the favorite for this Grand Prix. Winner in 2019 he was also very comfortable there in 2018 and 2021. Last year Lewis Hamilton was able to beat him thanks to a new engine and after a fierce battle between the two men sometimes beyond the limit of reason. For the Mercedes F1 driver contemplating victory will be almost impossible. On the other hand we could potentially see confirmation that Mercedes has returned to the level of Ferrari or even slightly ahead. Behind the battle between Alpine F1 and McLaren will continue to rage for fourth place in the championship. Brazilian Grand Prix timetable For the last time this season F1 is heading to the Americas with evening times for European spectators. They will however be less late than those of the GP of the United States and Mexico.  Friday November 11 430530 p.m. Free Practice 1 800900 p.m. Qualifying  Saturday November 12 430530 p.m. Free practice 2 830900 p.m. Sprint  Sunday November 13 700 p.m.900 p.m. Race The winners of the Brazilian Grand Prix

Latifi leaves Formula 1 with no regrets - US Sports, https://lookcharms.com/latifi-leaves-formula-1-with-no-regrets/, The Canadian driver is Alexander Albons teammate and despite two years of experience with the team he is dominated by the Thai driver. He was frustrated with his race and his comments did not reflect what he thought of Nyck De Vries race. After three full seasons in Formula 1 the Canadian driver will bid farewell to the discipline after the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. He has no regrets even though he hoped for more from his time in Formula 1. At the end of the day I dont really have any regrets about my approach to Formula 1., The Canadian driver is Alexander Albons teammate and despite two years of experience with the team he is dominated by the Thai driver. Latifis lack of results and the underperformance of Monza or replacement Nyck De Vries surpassed him and scored his first points in Formula 1 in his first race tarnished the results of his season. Affected by this event which played an important role in his ousting from the team. The Canadian spoke about this weekend which was difficult for him at the microphone of the podcast Beyond The Grid he first insisted on the excellent form of the Williams on the Italian track.  Its probably the circuit where we were the most competitive compared to the others Im not going to talk about the strengths of our car because we were very fast on the straights but the reason we were is that we didnt have much support  Latifi also returned to his less than complimentary remarks after the race towards his teammate. He was frustrated with his race and his comments did not reflect what he thought of Nyck De Vries race. It was extremely impressive the car as I said was more competitive there but it was still a difficult car to drive. Afterwards I was frustrated with my race and people misinterpreted what I said. I was frustrated with my race and had a microphone put in front of me right after which nobody really appreciates. I was annoyed by the cars problems and people took my frustration at having had a bad race.  After three full seasons in Formula 1 the Canadian driver will bid farewell to the discipline after the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. He has no regrets even though he hoped for more from his time in Formula 1. There are definitely a lot of things that I will miss but there are also a lot that I wont miss. Im really not one of those people who will be bitter. At the end of the day I dont really have any regrets about my approach to Formula 1. I would have hoped for a lot more it goes without saying.  Logan Sargeant who is currently in Formula 2 is the one who will take Latifis place next season if he obtains his super license at the end of the last Formula 2 meeting in Abu Dhabi.

Formula 1 | Gasly explains how he will miss 'the world of Red Bull' - US Sports, https://lookcharms.com/formula-1-gasly-explains-how-he-will-miss-the-world-of-red-bull/, The Frenchman is ending an eightyear association with Red Bull as he swaps his AlphaTauri seat for that of Alpine F1. He was then promoted to Red Bull Racing in 2019 but his disappointing spell only lasted 12 races before returning to Faenza. Red Bull gives access to so many industries and so many other sports and athletes explains Gasly.  I have met hundreds of Red Bull athletes from different sports and the experience and knowledge you gain from that is invaluable.  Im going to Red Bull Japan and theyre there for us  you find your feet pretty much anywhere in the world inside Red Bull and thats definitely going to change and Im going to miss that., Pierre Gasly said he will miss the offtrack benefits that come with being a Red Bull driver and that the team is much bigger than what people see in a race. The Frenchman is ending an eightyear association with Red Bull as he swaps his AlphaTauri seat for that of Alpine F1. Gasly first joined the Red Bull group in 2014 as a member of the junior team before becoming a fulltime driver for Toro Rosso in 2018. He was then promoted to Red Bull Racing in 2019 but his disappointing spell only lasted 12 races before returning to Faenza. Red Bull gives access to so many industries and so many other sports and athletes explains Gasly.  What people see is mainly whats going on in the paddock and around Formula 1 but Red Bull is so much bigger than that. Ive talked about it with a few friends  being part of Red Bull you gives access to an incredible world.   I have met hundreds of Red Bull athletes from different sports and the experience and knowledge you gain from that is invaluable.   I will miss adventures and activities Ive flown stunt planes Ive been skydiving Ive surfed in Australia Ive done stuff Ill talk about all my life.  Along with these adventures away from the track Gasly believes Red Bulls presence around the world has been very beneficial to him. I have been seen as a Red Bull athlete everywhere I go for nine years. Red Bull has offices all over the world. go to Red Bull America they welcome me and take care of me.   Im going to Red Bull Japan and theyre there for us  you find your feet pretty much anywhere in the world inside Red Bull and thats definitely going to change and Im going to miss that.   As for AlphaTauri specifically I call them my second family. They gave me my chance in F1 and I have worked with them for several years. They know me and know everything about me my personality and the way I work. Its very natural to work with them.   It hasnt been on my mind yet but for sure Abu Dhabi is going to be emotionally charged knowing that I wont be with them anymore. But I know in my life these are times which I will remember with very very fond memories.

Formula 1 | F1 promises the 'best show in the world' in Las Vegas… at an affordable price - US Sports, https://lookcharms.com/formula-1-f1-promises-the-best-show-in-the-world-in-las-vegas-at-an-affordable-price/, F1 continues to raise expectations around its next Grand Prix it will be the direct promoter in Las Vegas next year. Liberty Media promises affordable seats for everyoneOn the side of Liberty Media and its manager for F1 Stefano Domenicali we know that Las Vegas will be a key meeting for this Grand Prix where the Americans themselves will be the promoters. Stefano Domenicali promises it Liberty Media will put the necessary means. We are going to put on the biggest show in the world and show the world what F1 is all about. Emily Prazer former head of business development for F1 and now commercial director of Las Vegas is also on the front line for this Grand Prix., F1 continues to raise expectations around its next Grand Prix it will be the direct promoter in Las Vegas next year. It was at the emblematic Caesars Palace that a promotional event was organized this Saturday evening and Liberty Media had provided the means demonstration cars pit stop simulations F1 simulators trophies Lewis Hamilton Sergio Prez George Russell and Alexander Albon were even there they were able to drive their demonstration singleseaters on the Las Vegas Strip and entertain the public. And Lewis Hamilton who gratified the public with a few donuts also had a mishap a false contact on his Mercedes in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip almost made him part of the decor I almost crashed smiled Lewis Hamilton. There was so much smoke and I had no idea where I was. I was completely lost. I couldnt find the buildings so I started backing up and the barrier was right there.  Liberty Media promises affordable seats for everyone On the side of Liberty Media and its manager for F1 Stefano Domenicali we know that Las Vegas will be a key meeting for this Grand Prix where the Americans themselves will be the promoters. Stefano Domenicali promises it Liberty Media will put the necessary means. F1 will have a special positioning for this race. We are going to put on the biggest show in the world and show the world what F1 is all about.  Emily Prazer former head of business development for F1 and now commercial director of Las Vegas is also on the front line for this Grand Prix. You can imagine the pressure on his shoulders She recalls her main challenges not only Liberty Media does not have the experience of promoting races but also the topography of Las Vegas is very special Its one thing to organize a race but its another thing to organize a race that has never happened before especially in a city like Las Vegas. F1 has never sold tickets before they have never promoted an event before.  We are Liberty employees working from offices in Vegas as if we were a promoter but we are working hand in hand with F1 to put on the best event in the world.  Vegas is asking for a completely different model because of the infrastructure the casinos and the customers.  This race is fully supported by Liberty. Our advantage is being an hour and a half from Denver. So from an infrastructure perspective its amazing.  Prazer also promises it the tickets will be sold at an affordable price at least at the first price to allow everyone or almost to smell the smell of F1. We are planning a huge fan festival of 45000 people. We work with casinos to organize  watch parties .  The idea is that between now and November 2023 our only objective is to organize the best race in the world and to make sure that we do not miss this opportunity.  We are planning general admission tickets at affordable prices tickets that will give access to hospitality areas. So we try to make it accessible.  The other thing were trying to do is add value to our tickets and I think well be the first allinclusive race on the calendar. Thus food and beverages with the exception of alcohol for legal reasons will be provided with any type of grandstand ticket purchased.   We think yes Vegas is going to be more expensivebut we also wonder how people can afford the ticket they want or have access to the tickets they want.  From our perspective its about reproducing the feeling that everyone is welcome. There are over 150000 hotel rooms here in Vegas which means theres plenty of space and Vegas appeals to everyone theres the super luxury but theres also the rooms at very good price.  We are still talking about tickets costing up to 100000 dollars MGM Resorts International will offer such a package including hotel nights. Caesars Palace will also offer experiences at 5000 dollars for three nights But for Prazer this is a false debate.  This perception sur les tickets  100 000 dollars is probably based on the ultimate F1 racing experience  which could be organized for big casino customers who are ready to come and lose millions of dollars that weekend.  The thing about Vegas is that there is very low end and very high end. There is something for every taste.  Let it be said Prazer therefore remains confident for the success of its event  Im not as worried about it as some people think.  The level of expectation on the final product has to be taken into account so my biggest stress is making sure we meet that expectation.  I think thats what keeps me up at night. Pressure de Formula 1 and Vegas. With all the news and what everyone is talking about you can feel it.

Valtteri Bottas open to "interesting" US move after Formula 1 career ends, https://www.planetf1.com/news/valtteri-bottas-indycar-interesting/, Valtteri Bottas can see himself making a move to IndyCar racing when he is done with Formula 1. The Finn is into what is probably the third and final phase of his F1 career barring an unexpected twist. Maybe Ill be racing in the US in the future he told The Ringer F1 podcast. Its been gaining popularity at least in Europe so lets see.What do the next few years hold for Valtteri Bottas Reports suggest they are keen on Mick Schumacher so that could potentially impact upon Bottas or Zhou., Valtteri Bottas can see himself making a move to IndyCar racing when he is done with Formula 1. The Finn is into what is probably the third and final phase of his F1 career barring an unexpected twist. He began racing with Williams in 2013 and after becoming a regular visitor to the podium the following year and backing that up with two further solid campaigns he earned his big opportunity at Mercedes after Nico Rosberg retired. Five seasons and 10 race wins later plus a 100 record in the Constructors Championship with the Silver Arrows Bottas clambered out of the pressure cooker when deposed by the team in favour of George Russell and opted for a multiyear contract at Alfa Romeo under a dimmer spotlight. Now 33 and no longer a realistic contender for victories it is inevitable that he should start to think about what could be ahead in the medium term. That could mean a Stateside switch Bottas has admitted. Maybe Ill be racing in the US in the future he told The Ringer F1 podcast. IndyCar is quite interesting. The tracks are nice and the racing seems really real. Its been gaining popularity at least in Europe so lets see. What do the next few years hold for Valtteri Bottas Certainly until the end of 2024 he can be considered the driver team leader at Alfa Romeo with Zhou Guanyu confirmed alongside him for a second season. In saying that though despite their difference in experience there has not been much between the duo in performance during the second half of this season  the Chinese rookie has definitely not been left in Bottas wake. The big unknown is what will happen when Audi start to get their feet under the table at Sauber with whom they are officially linking up from 2026 after Alfa Romeos sponsorship deal concludes at the end of 2023. Will the German manufacturer want a say regarding drivers from say 2024 onwards Reports suggest they are keen on Mick Schumacher so that could potentially impact upon Bottas or Zhou. And we are not suggesting he will be tackling the Tour de France in the foreseeable future but it may also be worth keeping an eye on Bottas burgeoning cycling activity just in case that impacts upon any decisions he makes regarding F1. His Australian partner Tiffany Cromwell is of course a professional road cyclist  a multiple Giro dItalia stage winner no less  and the duo recently teamed up to win a gravel race in Kansas.

Why Max Verstappen has a lack of excitement about breaking Formula 1 win record, https://www.planetf1.com/news/max-verstappen-lack-excitement-record/, Although Max Verstappen has broken the record for most wins in a single season it is not something he spends too much time thinking about. I try to win the races and that for me is the most important. Another great race he said in regard to Mexico. So another great race but also its just an incredible season for us as a team. Never thought I would be able to win 14 races in a year., Although Max Verstappen has broken the record for most wins in a single season it is not something he spends too much time thinking about. The Dutchman has already broken plenty of records including youngest driver to ever enter score points and win a race and given a rule change that states drivers must now be 18 and over to race in F1 he is likely to keep those accolades. With his victory in Mexico he overtook Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel in terms of the highest number of wins achieved in a single season having won 14 of the 20 races so far. But it appears that is not something he is too fussed about and throughout his career every milestone he passes has been met with an apathetic shrug by Verstappen. The Red Bull driver has been explaining why he is so nonplussed about those records. I was never really interested in stats he said at the postMexican Grand Prix press conference. I just live in the moment. I just try to of course do the best I can every single weekend. I try to win the races and that for me is the most important. Every single weekend when I go home and I can say to myself I maximised or close to that Im happy. But of course a lot in Formula 1 depends on your whole package. And we are having a great package and Im just enjoying the moment and Im not that interested in keeping in touch with every stat. But of course it is an amazing season and Im very happy with winning so many races. Verstappen did however admit 14 wins in a season is something he never thought he would be able to do. Another great race he said in regard to Mexico. We knew the first stint would be the crucial one for us to keep the soft tyres alive long enough which seemed to work. I did struggle a bit towards the end but luckily the gap was big enough to extend a few laps. Once we put on the medium tyres everything was working quite well. I think quite early on we figured we could make it to the end. So another great race but also its just an incredible season for us as a team. Never thought I would be able to win 14 races in a year. But Im incredibly proud. Read more George Russell teases Sky F1s David Croft with Red Bull boycott joke
Formula 1 | Verstappen: 'We've been close to perfect' this year - US Sports, https://lookcharms.com/formula-1-verstappen-weve-been-close-to-perfect-this-year-2/, Max Verstappen is not a driver who tends to sit back and dwell on his successes. You cant be perfect but in most races we were close to perfection. Verstappen intends in any case to benefit from the good start of his team in this new era of F1. Maybe thats the right word according to Verstappen who doesnt think he gets faster  naturally . I will try to do different types of races because it is important to try different things., Max Verstappen is not a driver who tends to sit back and dwell on his successes. The emphasis is always on the followup. Because as he often says  youre only as good as your next trick . However he has just had a remarkable season  a season which after three races saw the now double world champion having to come up 46 points behind due to mechanics. But he then chained 13 wins from 17 races breaking the record for most wins in a year 14 with two races to go. His victory in Mexico also set the record for most points in a year 416.  Its been an amazing season. As a team we certainly didnt expect something like this. We had a competitive start but we gave up two out of three times. It wasnt the best start years trying to defend the riders title on my side.   After that we had a great turnaround we kept pushing we kept believing we kept improving the car which was the most important area. Thats why were here. today. As a team we made very few mistakes. You cant be perfect but in most races we were close to perfection.  Here are two titles in hand and others could follow. Verstappen intends in any case to benefit from the good start of his team in this new era of F1.  Building something special is what we are trying to do. With the regulations remaining more or less the same for years to come we can take advantage of that.   Red Bull is my second family they were already world champions before I arrived. We had a little trouble at the start but I always believed in the project. All the team we have  at the factory for both the car and the engine  are a really great group of people who I think can be successful for many years to come.  You have to make sure you find the right people and put them in the right position. The most important thing is that everyone gets along well and that everyone understands their role. With Honda and now in our own engine division it is  Its about figuring out how to work together. The implementation of the two together has been very good in recent years. And in 2021 it helped us take that final leap that we were missing to fight for a title.   The first title was very emotional because you realize youve achieved everything in the sport that you wanted to achieve. The second one because of the season weve had is probably more rewarding. Theyre very different feelings this which I think is great because it would be a bit boring if they were the same.  And in terms of driving did he see a clear difference between his performance in 2021 and that of 2022 His team found him more mature. Maybe thats the right word according to Verstappen who doesnt think he gets faster  naturally .  You grow as a person every year you learn a lot from every year about what happened in every race you try to improve as a driver. I dont think you improve in terms of raw speed in a natural way but through the experiences you have had in the past you try to put that into your game. In some tricky situations it can sometimes help you because of the previous experiences you have. Verstappen has already made it known that he will not be like Lewis Hamilton or Fernando Alonso there is no question of seeing him in F1 until he is 40 years old. The Dutchman has plenty of plans including the 24 Hours of Le Mans the only race he has admitted to wanting to do in the future  not too far .  Yeah I said it I cant see myself driving until Im 40 because I want to do something else. Im having a lot of fun with what Im doing now  Im still here for a few more years I am under contract until 2028. After that it will depend on how everything develops. I will try to do different types of races because it is important to try different things.   Records were never important I really appreciate the moment. Ive enjoyed being part of this team for a long time and hopefully for a long time to come. With all the people we have now I think we can be strong for a few years. 
Krack: Better results push Vettel for his final races, https://www.formulanerds.com/news/krack-better-results-push-vettel-for-his-final-races/, Aston Martin team boss Mike Krack explains why. Vettel scored points every time in the races in Singapore Japan and the USA and was Driver of the Day twice. The better results push VettelMike Krack should be pleased with the development of the German driver. Aston Martin is in the middle of a battle with Alfa Romeo for 6th place in the Constructors Championship. Just going by statistics it would be easy but Alfa Romeo is a team that we highly respect., Latest Episode  Cut To The Race Podcast After Sebastian Vettels announcement to retire after this Formula 1 season he is performing in top form. Aston Martin team boss Mike Krack explains why. In his second season at Aston Martin everything was supposed to be better for Sebastian Vettel but all the effort that went into the current season didnt pay off for him. He is going to leave Formula 1 after the last race of the season in Abu Dhabi. But there is no trace of fatigue or demotivation. Vettel scored points every time in the races in Singapore Japan and the USA and was Driver of the Day twice. Even though he finished the race in Mexico outside the points he saw the chequered flag before his teammate Lance Stroll. Mike Krack sees an apparent reason for Vettels motivational boost. The better results push Vettel Mike Krack should be pleased with the development of the German driver. Aston Martin is in the middle of a battle with Alfa Romeo for 6th place in the Constructors Championship. Only a few points separate the teams at the moment. Krack when asked if Vettel is currently in one of his best forms explains according to racingnews365 Probably yes. I think he gained from the better performance or the better results. It added a little bit even more to his motivation and its really nice to see him work. We had to kick him out of the office yesterday night over the Mexican Grand Prix weekend otherwise he would have still been there studying data looking at where you can change things. Krack is sure that Vettel still has scores to settle in Formula 1. So hes not on a farewell this I can tell you for sure. He really wants to do well. He wants to bring us forward and bring his part to finish the season in the best possible place. Krack suspects an intense fight for P6 Even though Vettel is in good form and the team seems to be on the way up it will be challenging to prevail against Alfa Romeo. Valtteri Bottas and Guanyu Zhou have shown time and again how they can impose the strengths of the C42. Krack also sees that the battle will be tough I think its not a home run at all. Just going by statistics it would be easy but Alfa Romeo is a team that we highly respect. You have seen at the beginning of the season what they were capable of doing. And I think although the difference in points is small I think it will be very hard to pass them. Fred Vasseur Team Principal at Alfa Romeo said they had upgrades again and I think it will be a fight until the last lap in Abu Dhabi. We are curious to see what Vettel can still achieve at Aston Martin in the two remaining races and whether it will be enough for sixth place in the team standings.

Domenicali: Lack of 2022 title showdown won’t impact F1 business, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/domenicali-lack-of-2022-title-showdown-wont-impact-f1-business/10395745/, Domenicali says that theres still plenty of interest in the remaining races of 2022 and he insists that there will be no negative impact on the F1 business. He also confident that next years fight will be more competitive and will potentially go the last round once again. And I would like to add if I may we are totally positive on the impact that the change in regulations brought this year. And Im totally confident that next year the fight on the track will arrive up to end of the calendar. First of all being a world championship we can spread around the world the risk of having this kind of situation to manage he said., Listen to this article In stark contrast to last years final lap thriller in Abu Dhabi Max Verstappen clinched the 2022 world championship at Suzuka with four rounds still to run while his Red Bull team secured the constructors version at the next race in the USA. Domenicali says that theres still plenty of interest in the remaining races of 2022 and he insists that there will be no negative impact on the F1 business. He also confident that next years fight will be more competitive and will potentially go the last round once again. Well actually we dont see any kind of risk at all he said when asked in a call with Wall Street analysts if the lack of a title showdown would be bad for F1s finances. And first of all we have the last race with sold out tickets and the numbers are really good. The attention will be shipped of course to other fights for the sporting perspective. So thats part of racing. And I would like to add if I may we are totally positive on the impact that the change in regulations brought this year. And we cannot comment on the fact that a team but specifically in this case Red Bull or Max Verstappen did an incredible job. Maybe some other teams didnt take the right opportunities. But what we saw on the track is wheeltowheel racing. Thats what we wanted. And Im totally confident that next year the fight on the track will arrive up to end of the calendar. And as youll see the last races on the sporting side there is a lot of attention. There is a fight for places that also for the team perspective is related to their financial position and the financial reward if they achieve a position. So I think that there will be a lot of interest in Brazil and Abu Dhabi too with no problem. Stefano Domenicali CEO Formula 1 Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images Domenicali also countered any suggestion that economic problems in Europe might impact F1 ticket sales and hence revenue in 2023. First of all being a world championship we can spread around the world the risk of having this kind of situation to manage he said. On the other hand the fact that we have longterm agreements will reduce the exposure to this risk. And what I can say and share with you is that we already see an incredible number of preregistrations with regards to ticketing of next year. So this is a good sign that youre seeing mainly in Europe where Im living where it is clear that this recession is taking place. But I think that the way that we are structured the way that we have done the deals will enable us to move forward in this direction. Therefore I would say this current situation lets us think that we should be optimistic in this context. Of course we monitor it but this is what we see today.

That also means Ricciardos time in F1 is winding down as well as the driver does not have a seat for next season. Given that his plans are in the air perhaps a future with the Bills in some capacity is in the cards

Audi has also been on a massive recruitment drive for their power unit department something Team Principal Fred Vasseur says will be key to their initial success on track.

Audi has also been on a massive recruitment drive for their power unit department something Team Principal Fred Vasseur says will be key to their initial success on track. You know that performance is coming from everywhere. Its never one single topic. It means that we know that we are far too small in terms of headcount Vasseur told media including RacingNews365.com. Also that we are something like 500 people today when some other F1 teams are perhaps 200 more. For sure we have to do a step forward but we have also three years to do it and it will be a challenge but I think the challenge is very positive. But on the other hand I dont want to lose the path of the next two years because the best way to prepare the future is also to perform and I want to keep the team motivated and focus on the 23 24 and 25.

A partnership with the talented Lando Norris with a team poised to challenge for wins in the near future was expected to be a career revival for Ricciardo after he spent two years in the midfield with Renault.

His performances were consistently poor by his and the teams standards and earlier this year it was revealed that Ricciardo would leave at the end of the season. Ricciardos sacking comes despite having a year left on his contract. Next season will be the first since 2010 that we wont see Ricciardo on the grid. Hes one of the most popular drivers and his absence is one that will surely be felt throughout the community. He is expected to stay in touch with F1 as he plans on returning in 2024.

Red Bull will get a new windtunnel thanks to Mateschitz, https://f1i.com/news/459541-red-bull-will-get-a-new-windtunnel-thanks-to-mateschitz.html, Red Bull Racing will finally get a new state of the art windtunnel to aid its research and development work. The team is currently still using the same windtunnel that it started with when Red Bull bought out the Jaguar F1 team in 2004. It was one of the commitments that Dietrich made to the business to invest in a new tunnel referring to Red Bull team founder Dieter Mateschitz who passed away in October aged 78 following a long illness. A new windtunnel has recently become a major imperative under new testing regulations and also Red Bull incurring 10 per cent reduction in the aerodynamic testing allowance for exceeding the budget cap in 2021. Once the tunnel regulations were introduced the efficiency of our tunnel just wasnt comparable with where the regulations are going Horner explained., Red Bull Racing will finally get a new state of the art windtunnel to aid its research and development work. The team is currently still using the same windtunnel that it started with when Red Bull bought out the Jaguar F1 team in 2004. It was one of the assets of the defunct Arrows squad with a history dating back to the end of WW2 as an aircraft development facility. Team principal Christian Horner recently complained about the relic of the cold war and highlighted issues with temperature control due to the size and age of the building. The team has been planning to build a new windtunnel as part of its technology campus in Milton Keynes. This week Horner confirmed to The Race that the project had been given the goahead. It was one of the commitments that Dietrich made to the business to invest in a new tunnel referring to Red Bull team founder Dieter Mateschitz who passed away in October aged 78 following a long illness. A new windtunnel has recently become a major imperative under new testing regulations and also Red Bull incurring 10 per cent reduction in the aerodynamic testing allowance for exceeding the budget cap in 2021. The elderly facility takes extra time to reach the required wind speed and that all comes out of the allowance. Once the tunnel regulations were introduced the efficiency of our tunnel just wasnt comparable with where the regulations are going Horner explained. It forced our hand that we needed to make that big capital investment he continued. So thats what weve chosen to do. Building a new windtunnel could take two years to complete which means it will only come online long after Red Bulls penalty expires. And it might have a short shelf life with the FIA discussing banning the use of air tunnels altogether from 2030. Red Bulls technical chief Adrian Newey has been among those in favour of a ban and a move to fully CFD computational fluid dynamics instead. When you look at the way the worlds going simulation is playing a bigger and bigger role Horner acknowledged. We should have been brave enough to look at walking away from tunnels in the future. Unfortunately there was a fearbased culture rather than an embracing one. Other teams including McLaren and Aston Martin have also made the same decision to invest in new windtunnels while they can with squads seeing them as major capital assets.

Formula 1 | Russell: Our lifestyle is 'not healthy' in Formula 1 - US Sports, https://lookcharms.com/formula-1-russell-our-lifestyle-is-not-healthy-in-formula-1/, On becoming a Mercedes F1 driver George Russell moved to the front of the grid and has been steadily battling for a podium spot since this year. The Briton thus evokes a lifestyle that is not  not healthy not only for the drivers but also for the entire Formula 1 paddock forced to live at a hellish pace.  We visit 22 countries in one year we stay in 22 different hotels we eat 22 different kinds of food and we experience ten different time zones. For Russell another difficult aspect of his job as an F1 driver is having to systematically satisfy public opinion he who insists on reminding us that he is not a robot. Riding is easy because its my job Im happy as soon as I put my helmet on., On becoming a Mercedes F1 driver George Russell moved to the front of the grid and has been steadily battling for a podium spot since this year. But to shine in the top category of motorsport is not easy with great pressure on the shoulders and it is being constantly or almost on the move around the world. The Briton thus evokes a lifestyle that is not  not healthy not only for the drivers but also for the entire Formula 1 paddock forced to live at a hellish pace. I am driven and motivated by performing winning races and becoming world champion. But this sport is exhausting Russell said.  There is the physical aspect but also the psychological one. You experience so many emotions during a race weekend the successes the ups the downs. Traveling is also demanding on the body. It is not a style healthy lifestyle. And Im not just talking about the drivers but everyone in this sport.   We visit 22 countries in one year we stay in 22 different hotels we eat 22 different kinds of food and we experience ten different time zones. This lack of routine is not good for anyone. Today I would say to you that I can go on until Im 40 but maybe Ill say something very different in five years.  For Russell another difficult aspect of his job as an F1 driver is having to systematically satisfy public opinion he who insists on reminding us that he is not a robot.  So much is expected of athletes these days and I think people sometimes forget that we are human beings. I am a racing driver not an activist or a politician. You are expected to have the right opinion about everything and for me at 24 thats probably the hardest part of the job. Riding is easy because its my job Im happy as soon as I put my helmet on.  Russell also has a thought for the drivers who will leave the paddock at the end of the season whether by choice or lack of opportunity.  Sebastian Vettel is retiring and one of the biggest names in the history of our sport is leaving while Daniel Ricciardo will probably not be driving next year. I have a huge respect for them and they will obviously be greatly missed by the sport but like any industry F1 will run its course. Thats the reality. 
Bottas keen to stick around for Audi arrival at Sauber F1, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/bottas-keen-audi-arrival-sauber/10395066/, For current Alfa Romeo driver Bottas who joined the privateer after five years at Mercedes driving for a bona fide works team again is naturally an enticing prospect. When asked in Mexico if he is hoping to stick around at Sauber when Audi jumps on board in 2026 Bottas said Why not Valtteri Bottas Alfa Romeo F1 Team Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport ImagesWhile Bottas conceded Alfa Romeo needs a lot of work to become competitive he hopes extra Audi backing ahead of its official 2026 entry can help the team bridge the gap to the frontrunners. I think the timeline depends on how much Audi is going to support this team before they officially come as a manufacturer. Were still with Alfa Romeo., Listen to this article Last month Audi officially confirmed it would join forces with Sauber as its power unit manufacturer in 2026 when a new engine formula will kick in. After Alfa Romeos sponsorship deal with the Hinwil team lapses at the end of 2023 it is expected Audi will gradually start ramping up its involvement as it becomes a shareholder in the Swiss outfit. For current Alfa Romeo driver Bottas who joined the privateer after five years at Mercedes driving for a bona fide works team again is naturally an enticing prospect. When asked in Mexico if he is hoping to stick around at Sauber when Audi jumps on board in 2026 Bottas said Why not Im 33 years old so I hope that Im going to be there. Bottas explained that Audis entry will help keep both him and the team motivated in the coming years. I would say yes because if you look at the big picture I think its huge. Theres big potential for Sauber with Audi. No doubt they want to succeed in the future. They want to do well and show theyre serious. So I think for any driver on the grid especially for me now being already part of Sauber it would be very interesting to be part of that project. I definitely think its possible. Valtteri Bottas Alfa Romeo F1 Team Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images While Bottas conceded Alfa Romeo needs a lot of work to become competitive he hopes extra Audi backing ahead of its official 2026 entry can help the team bridge the gap to the frontrunners. Theres still work to do no doubt. Thats the fact. But its not that far you know the facilities are there the Finn pointed out. Some facilities some machinery can be better compared to a championshipwinning team. And the amount of people in the team is still a bit less than at least what I saw last year. But with the support of a manufacturer like Audi I see no reason why it wouldnt be possible. I think the timeline depends on how much Audi is going to support this team before they officially come as a manufacturer. Obviously nothing changes for next year. Were still with Alfa Romeo. And of course we hope that we can have a better car than this year. But then I think it depends on the support from 2024 onwards. If Audi are willing to support if theyre really helping a lot and supporting and if the power unit is good for 2026 which is impossible to predict at the moment then why not.
F1 Team Bosses Give Their Take On The Upcoming F1 Movie, https://www.wtf1.com/post/f1-team-bosses-give-their-take-on-the-upcoming-f1-movie/, The Hollywood star was in the paddock taking notes for his new motorsport movie and F1 bosses have been giving their views on the project which involves Lewis Hamilton. Lewis has already called the movie the best racing movie thats ever existed but then he is a producer on it so hes not going to be too negative about it is he Then of course theres that Brad Pitt guyThe gang behind the movie also met with F1 teams in Austin to share their vision and it sounds encouraging Alfa Romeos Team Principal Frederic Vasseur has even suggested that the movie could have the same effect as Drive To Survive did a few years ago. It could be a mega step forward for F1 in general that as Netflix did a couple of years ago Vasseur said with Guenther Steiner also buzzing about the movie., Weve just about recovered after seeing Brad Pitt on our TV screens at the United States Grand Prix every few minutes. The Hollywood star was in the paddock taking notes for his new motorsport movie and F1 bosses have been giving their views on the project which involves Lewis Hamilton. Lewis has already called the movie the best racing movie thats ever existed but then he is a producer on it so hes not going to be too negative about it is he  To be fair to the seventime champ the pedigree behind the film does sound pretty incredible. Joseph Kosinski who helmed the recent Top Gun Maverick blockbuster is directing while legendary producer Jerry Bruckheimer is also involved. Then of course theres that Brad Pitt guy The gang behind the movie also met with F1 teams in Austin to share their vision and it sounds encouraging Alfa Romeos Team Principal Frederic Vasseur has even suggested that the movie could have the same effect as Drive To Survive did a few years ago. It could be a mega step forward for F1 in general that as Netflix did a couple of years ago Vasseur said with Guenther Steiner also buzzing about the movie. Talking about the technology which theyll be using Guenther said he was particularly impressed by it all. They used it to do Maverick. I didnt know that this existed he added. So I think they are the best out there at the moment to do something like this. As Fred said its the best for Formula 1. Its very good doing things like this with this calibre of people and I think there are no negatives there are just positives. Andreas Seidl the McLaren Team Principal also revealed that teams would be kept abreast of the plan of action which he said sounds very interesting and exciting. A bit of Top Gun style which I think for Formula 1 will be just great for the fans for the sport for us teams being involved as well. Im looking forward to that project seeing it first of all coming to life next year for us when its actually happening and then seeing the movie later on. There was suggestions that the film would be shot during F1 weekends in the second half of the 2023 season too  Are you looking forward to the movie Comment below.

Video: F1 pit-stops under two seconds are allowed (and THIS is why), https://racingnews365.com/video-f1-pit-stops-under-two-seconds-are-allowed-and-this-is-why, A change in Formula 1 regulations this year has seen the sport move from 13inch wheels to 18inch ones. This has made the tyres heavier and thus more difficult for mechanics to change all four of them quickly and safely during pitstops.

The German believes the organisation is waiting too long to take steps and therefore hopes for change in the future he told Der Spiegel. Article continues under ad The motorsport class is revamping the engine regulations in the 2026 season. These new rules should ensure that Formula 1 becomes more sustainable and therefore moves with the times. Although Vettel supports the plans he actually thinks it is too little and too late. I think 2026 is too late to see it as pioneering. Synthetic fuels already exist so why wait another four years he argues. Formula 1 is far too busy with the now and looks far too little at the possibilities of the future. It is busy expanding instead of being a pacesetter for tomorrows mobility with foresight. Vettel critical of the organisation Therefore in the interview Vettel decides to give Formula 1 a slap on the wrist. The veteran driver who is retiring from the sport after this season finds it unjustifiable that it takes several years to address the problems. I find it a bit embarrassing.

This energy can be better used for heating and hot water.

Brazils Sprint will be the final one of the current season but the event is not one that Verstappen looks forward to.

And for me thats not really a race because then you go into the main race., Max Verstappen has explained why he is not a fan of the F1 Sprint race ahead of its return for the Brazilian Grand Prix. The shortened race  which takes place on a Saturday and decides the grid for Sundays main event  has been held over three weekends in both 2021 and 2022 with that number set to increase to six in 2023. Brazils Sprint will be the final one of the current season but the event is not one that Verstappen looks forward to. I dont like it Verstappen told media including RacingNews365.com when asked for his thoughts on the increased amount of Sprint races in 2023. For me the weekend format isnt one that I enjoy. I dont mind the one practice and going straight into qualifying  I think it probably is even better for me. But theres no feeling in the Sprint races. All the time when I do these races its all about Lets not have damage make sure that you stay in the top three. And for me thats not really a race because then you go into the main race. There are way more points available there anyway and you just risk anyway a bit more there. You do another start probably thats a bit of excitement. Its only people who are really out of position that will move forward because normally you put the tyre on which just lasts the whole Sprint anyway go the race distance and not much happens.
IndyCar's F1-testing duo see a superlicence 'blockage', https://the-race.com/formula-1/indycars-f1-testing-duo-see-a-superlicence-blockage/, The two latest IndyCar drivers to appear in Formula 1 sessions both admit they have qualms about the FIA superlicence system. Asked if IndyCar should be represented better Palou said Yeah but I dont think thats going to change at all. OWard has been outspoken on the superlicence situation before and labelled IndyCar underrated in a recent interview with The Race. Because I feel like theres a lot of opportunities that have been wasted because of having a blockage of superlicence. When confirming that Herta did not qualify for a superlicence this year it reiterated it continuously reviews regulations and procedures including with respect to superlicence eligibility., The two latest IndyCar drivers to appear in Formula 1 sessions both admit they have qualms about the FIA superlicence system. Alex Palou drove for McLaren in FP1 at the United States Grand Prix last month and already has a superlicence supplemented by his 2021 IndyCar title. M c Laren stars new attitude towards his F1 dream Read more However Pato OWard  due to drive in Abu Dhabi FP1 also for McLaren  does not have a superlicence despite finishing fourth third and seventh in the last three IndyCar championships while winning four races  the same number as Palou  in the last two seasons. And with both drivers routes to IndyCar having been unusual in themselves  with both diverting via Super Formula in Japan OWard also a sportscar racer and very briefly a Red Bull junior and Palou struggling for budget in European singleseaters  OWard believes theyre also examples of how random the superlicence points situation can become for anyone deviating from the F1 support bill norm. The superlicence systems perceived shortcomings were highlighted by fellow IndyCar driver Colton Hertas plight earlier this year as he tried to gain dispensation to take up a seat AlphaTauri wanted to give him but a lack of intervention from the FIA meant Herta had to forego the seat now taken by Nyck de Vries. Currently the IndyCar champion gets 40 points  the same as for winning F2  but while F2 offers 40 points for second and third which is still enough for an F1 superlicence IndyCars points scale decreases dramatically. The American series gets 30 points for second 20 for third 10 for fourth and eight for fifth. OWard earned just four points for his seventhplace finish this year despite the competitiveness of the series and his season which was hampered by reliability issues despite a record that included qualifying in the top six on every road course and a seriesequalling best average starting position alongside his impressive win tally. The systems quirks have been exposed further this year as Linus Lundqvist  the Indy Lights champion who won the heavilyweighted Formula Regional Americas title in 2020  has qualified for a superlicence via racing on the junior ladder before he has even raced in IndyCar. Asked if IndyCar should be represented better Palou said Yeah but I dont think thats going to change at all. Obviously I have my superlicence. Im happy so I dont care what happens. But obviously I think its very unfair that theres some series that they dont get enough licence points  like Pato doesnt have and he finished third in the championship fourth in the championship and fifth or seventh. A guy that is like that doing 17 weekends racing against people that have 10 or 15 years of experience in IndyCar  that guy is capable of doing a lot in F1. But thats the rules. So hopefully they change it in the future. But I understand that also the FIA they want everybody to go through Europe and through other places. But its true that you could get more points by racing in I dont know a winter series in Thailand and winning that an Asian F3 title is 10 points than finishing fifth in IndyCar eight points. Thats a bit like I dont know if thats fair or not. OWards superlicence situation came back to haunt him in 2019 when Red Bull gambled on adding him to its junior programme  for which he gave up a Carlin IndyCar deal  due to its belief he had enough points for a superlicence. But with the number of competitors in some of the categories namely IMSA Prototype Challenge and Indy Lights that wouldve qualified him for points having been below the FIA requirement he was actually short of the required 40  and while Red Bull appeared willing to keep OWard on for another season he ultimately elected to take up McLarens offer to race for its newlyformed IndyCar team for 2020 where he immediately impressed. OWard has been outspoken on the superlicence situation before and labelled IndyCar underrated in a recent interview with The Race. I think as a driver and I think many others not just me in IndyCar have proven to be capable of being in Formula 1 deserve the shot to be Formula 1 and would be competitive in Formula 1 OWard said. And sadly IndyCar is very underrated. We all need to work as a community to fix that. Because I feel like theres a lot of opportunities that have been wasted because of having a blockage of superlicence. I think massive talents like Max Verstappen who is arguably the best driver on the grid right now he wouldnt have been able to come to Formula 1 if it was for the superlicence. And I think like Fernando Alonso wouldnt have either Kimi Raikkonen wouldnt have either. I get that they want to have something that qualifies you for it. But I really think that theres many qualified drivers that should have the shot and should have the chance to go into Formula 1 and and they dont because of that. I hope its something thats addressed. We all know how hard it is to win in IndyCar and how competitive it is. And anybody thats contending in IndyCar I believe deserves a shot in Formula 1. Or at least the chance right If a team decides to give it to them. OWard added that he thinks drivers who have unusual resumes such as his shouldnt be punished for sampling many championships when it comes to superlicence qualification. Not everyones career is going to be a perfect upbringing because not everybody has millions and millions to spend in order to get to Formula 1 he said. My career and many others have been insane. Japan Mexico prototypes America Europe its super diverse. But a lot of times when its diverse you dont complete championships certain things just happen because you dont have the funding to continue or just stuff like that. And its just a shame because I feel like theres a lot of lost talents that deserve a shot if a team decides to give it to them. But then they cant because of something else in the way. The FIAs superlicence system has not been inflexible since its introduction with the governing body having made changes to championships point allocations. It even made allowances for the impact of the COVID19 pandemic on drivers careers. When confirming that Herta did not qualify for a superlicence this year it reiterated it continuously reviews regulations and procedures including with respect to superlicence eligibility.
Lewis Hamilton calls on the FIA to protect 'integrity' in Formula 1: 'It's not enough at all' | Formula 1, https://www.aviationanalysis.net/lewis-hamilton-calls-on-the-fia-to-protect-integrity-in-formula-1-its-not-enough-at-all-formula-1/, The FIA confirmed last week that Red Bull spent more money last year building and developing the car than was allowed.

Verstappens second title has been impressive for different reasons. Verstappen described Red Bull as his second family and believes they can be successful for yearsThe first one was very emotional because you realise you have achieved everything in the sport you wanted to achieve he says., With pack up well under way at Suzuka on Sunday night Max Verstappen took five minutes to sit down with those closest in his team open a beer and reflect on what he had just achieved  the defence of his Formula 1 world title. There would not be much time to celebrate that night as he had already planned to fly back home so he could maximise the hours with his family and friends before the following race in Austin. Between a string of interviews  including one with us for broadcasters  there was only really time for a quick team photo debrief and short calls with his father and then his mother. READ MORE Hes been perfect  Horner full of praise after Verstappens recordbreaking victory Racing drivers dont tend to dwell on success. The focus is always on what is next. Youre only as good as your next lap. But in those five minutes Verstappen gave himself the chance to take it all in. This has been a remarkable season  one which after three races saw the now twotime world champion 46 points adrift in the championship hunt courtesy of two mechanicalrelated retirements. But he then went on a run of 13 wins in 17 races smashing the record of most wins in a year 14 with two races still to go. Victory in Mexico also set a record of the most points in a year 416. Its been an incredible season says Verstappen. As a whole team we definitely didnt expect something like this. We had a competitive start but we retired two times in three. It was not the best start to try and defend the title. After that we had a great turnaround  we kept on pushing kept on believing kept on improving the car which was the most important area. It is why we are here today. As a team we made very few mistakes. You cant be perfect but for most of the races we have been close to perfect. Verstappen and Red Bulls season did not get off to the best start after two retirements in the first three races  including in Australia Though Red Bull failed to win a title between 2014 and 2020 they remained operationally shrewd throughout and alongside building a mighty car for the newfor2022 regulations that has been one of the fundamental reasons they have been so relentlessly successful this year. Another has been the power unit in the back of the car. Though it is now under the Red Bull Powertrains banner courtesy of a brandnew division and huge investment from the energy drinks firm Honda continue to play an integral role  and its their constant development from one year to the next that has given Red Bull the grunt to fight at the sharp end. READ MORE I never thought Id be able to win 14 races in a year says recordbreaker Verstappen in Mexico Working together with Honda has been incredible and is incredible and they definitely deserve it that weve won it on their own track added Verstappen at Suzuka. Thanks goes out to the whole team back at the factory and those contributing to the powertrains division. They have been working flatout nobody is lacking motivation  and thats how I like to see. Verstappen himself has been key to their success. Having joined the team back in 2016 winning a race on debut with them in Barcelona he has set about building a dynasty that is showing shoots similar to that of Michael Schumacher at Ferrari Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes and Sebastian Vettel before him at Red Bull. But he knows its more than just about him  its about the people around him and how everyone gels together to work towards the same goal. Verstappen has been key to Red Bulls return to success after joining in 2016 and winning his first race for the team in Spain That building something special is what were trying to do he says. With the regulations more or less staying the same for the coming years we can take advantage of that. He adds Red Bull are my second family they were already world champions before I joined. We had a bit of a tough time at the start but I always believed in the project. The whole team we have  back at the factory designing the car combined with the powertrain division  we have a really great group of people who I think can be successful for quite a few years. TOP 10 We rank the best drives of double world champion Verstappens F1 career so far It goes higher up than me to make sure we find the right people and putting them into the right position. What is most important is that everyone gets on well and everyone understands their role. Honda and now coming into our own powertrains division its about understanding how to work together. Implementing the two together has been really strong the last few years. And thats helped us make that final jump that we were missing to fight for a title. Verstappens second title has been impressive for different reasons. Last year he fought tooth and nail to the seasonending race and clinched the title on the final lap of the season edging out Lewis Hamilton. This year after a slow start he has gone on an extraordinary run of form that has made the title a formality. Its no wonder then that each championship feels different. Verstappen described Red Bull as his second family and believes they can be successful for years The first one was very emotional because you realise you have achieved everything in the sport you wanted to achieve he says. The second one because of the season we have had is probably more rewarding. Its very different feelings which I think is great because it would be a little bit boring if they are the same. READ MORE I was there when Jolyon Palmer Will Buxton Mark Hughes and more reflect on Max Verstappen milestones Winning that first title had a positive effect on Verstappen in that it made him more relaxed and has seen him pull back on his allout attacking approach by the smallest of margins. In doing so it has also made him a more potent force. Make no mistake having an incredible car with a team working efficiently in terms of operations and strategy has made life easier  but hes still had to get the job done. You grow as a person every year you learn a lot from every single year what has happened at every single race you try to improve as a driver he says. I dont think you improve in terms of raw speed but because of the experiences you have had in the past you try to put that into play. In some tricky situations sometimes that can help you out because of the previous experiences you have. Verstappen has appeared a lot more relaxed behind the wheel this season after winning his first championship

Horner: Red Bull spoke to Norris "a couple of times" about F1 seat, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/horner-red-bull-norris-contract-talks/10395072/, Norris said at the time there had been little chats here and there with other teams before he signed his new McLaren deal but that nothing went far.Asked by Motorsport.com about the talks with Norris Red Bull team principal Horner said Weve spoken to Lando a couple of times over the years. But every time weve had a conversation the next day hes signed a contract with McLaren. Norris expanded on his comments about the Red Bull talks over the Mexico Grand Prix weekend saying his longterm McLaren deal was not in reaction to the talks with Red Bull. It wasnt just Red Bull. Before Ive ever spoken to anyone else my talks have always been with McLaren first said Norris., Listen to this article Ahead of the United Sates Grand Prix Norris revealed in an interview with German publication Auto Motor und Sport that he had spoken to Red Bull ahead of signing his latest McLaren deal. Back in February Norris put pen to paper on a new longterm contract with McLaren that will keep him with the team until at least the end of the 2025 season making it one of the longeststanding driver contracts on the grid. Norris said at the time there had been little chats here and there with other teams before he signed his new McLaren deal but that nothing went far. Asked by Motorsport.com about the talks with Norris Red Bull team principal Horner said Weve spoken to Lando a couple of times over the years. But every time weve had a conversation the next day hes signed a contract with McLaren. Hes on a longterm contract with McLaren and it looks like hes going to be there for a few more years. Christian Horner Team Principal Red Bull Racing congratulates Lando Norris McLaren 3rd position in Parc Ferme Photo by Mark Sutton  Motorsport Images Back in 2018 Red Bulls sister team Toro Rosso was interested in signing Norris when he was racing in F2 prior to McLaren confirming the Briton would be making the step up to F1 the following year. Norris expanded on his comments about the Red Bull talks over the Mexico Grand Prix weekend saying his longterm McLaren deal was not in reaction to the talks with Red Bull. It was more just when it came to the end of my contract and it wasnt like we were talking heavily said Norris. Everyone always tries to speak to all teams at some point so it was just that I spoke to them. I spoke to a few other people. But like a chance to chat. Its not like you know what can we do straightaway. Just keeping in touch things like that. Its as simple as that sometimes. I was just coming to the end of the contract when you see like what options are available you just kind of find out whats possible what might be possible over the next few years. It wasnt just Red Bull. Every driver has chats with a lot of different teams on what could happen. Simple as that basically. Following his F1 graduation in 2019 Norris signed subsequent deals with McLaren in May 2021 and in February of this year and clarified in Mexico that he had always been happy with the team. Before Ive ever spoken to anyone else my talks have always been with McLaren first said Norris. Its always how it goes. The best thing for me is signing the contract that I have now just having that confidence and knowledge that youre going to be in Formula 1 for whatever three four or five years. For me thats like the best feeling. It makes you more relaxed more comfortable in the environment youre in. So thats the best of all of it.

Hamilton was memorably involved in a tense battle for the title with Max Verstappen during the last campaign but lost out on the World Championship in the controversial final laps of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. In 2022 Mercedes have been unable to match the pace of rivals Red Bull and Ferrari and unless Hamilton achieves a victory in the final two races of the year it will mark the seventime World Champions first season in which he has not claimed a win. Hamiltons current contract with the Silver Arrows expires at the end of 2023 but he recently voiced his intention to remain with the team beyond then.

Will Alfa Romeo join forces with Haas in F1 2024?, https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1016277/1/will-alfa-romeo-join-forces-haas-f1-2024, Alfa Romeo have already announced their deal with Sauber comes to an end in 2023 paving way for Audis full takeover of the team in the subsequent years. However the Alfa Romeo name could be sticking around beyond next year according to reputable journalist Dieter Rencken. According to his report Alfa Romeo want to remain in F1 with Haas potentially the perfect fit for the Italian brand. Haas tricky history with sponsorsHaas were forced to drop Russian sponsor Uralkali ahead of the 2022 season. The partnership ultimately ended at the 2019 British Grand Prix after Rich Energy grew frustrated with Haas competitiveness., Alfa Romeo have already announced their deal with Sauber comes to an end in 2023 paving way for Audis full takeover of the team in the subsequent years. However the Alfa Romeo name could be sticking around beyond next year according to reputable journalist Dieter Rencken. According to his report Alfa Romeo want to remain in F1 with Haas potentially the perfect fit for the Italian brand. Recently Haas acquired a new title sponsor in the form of Moneygram reportedly worth 20 million per year. With Moneygrams colour scheme matching Alfa Romeos  red white and black colours  theres certainly some logic to it. Haas new sponsorship deal is an important one for the American outfit allowing them to push towards the F1 cost cap for the first time. They are on course for their best finish in the constructors championship for a number of years sitting in eighth overall with two rounds remaining. Haas tricky history with sponsors Haas were forced to drop Russian sponsor Uralkali ahead of the 2022 season. The company was coowned by Nikita Mazepins father Dmitry Mazepin. Haas opted to cut ties with Uralkali and their driver Mazepin due to Russias invasion of Ukraine. In more bizarre circumstances Rich Energy were their sponsors in 2019. Vocal on social media CEO William Storey had big ambitions for Haas and his energy drinks company wanting to take on Red Bull. The partnership ultimately ended at the 2019 British Grand Prix after Rich Energy grew frustrated with Haas competitiveness. Although theres always been a degree of uncertainty and mystery behind the legitimacy of Rich Energys finances and business as a whole.

He was poised to win the race and place first overall when a power unit problem forced him to quit. The Spaniard was really angry about that and said Car 14 stops and there always seems to be a problem with its dependability. I lost one cylinder 20 laps from the finish line which left me with five cylinders and 20 less power. The race was outstanding up until I pulled away from the McLaren and my teammate Esteban Ocon by 20 seconds. I ran my fastest races both here and in Austin. I believe that I have already lost 60 points this year so we add six more for a seventh place making it 66. Everyone else then obviously receives two points more than they ought to. Next season Alonso will switch from Alpine to Aston Martin. ALSO READ Mercedes Predicts a Gloomy Outcome for the Formula One Race in Brazil Saying It Wont Be As Competitive as Mexico
The start of the Verstappen era echoes the end of Vettel's, https://the-race.com/formula-1/the-start-of-the-verstappen-era-echoes-the-end-of-vettels/, The similarities between Max Verstappen and Red Bulls 2022 season and Sebastian Vettels allconquering 2013 campaign for the team are clear. The 2013 success was the fourth consecutive world championship double for Red Bull spearheaded by Vettel. Of course the Red Bull RB9 was strong from the start but it only got better as the season progressed. Late on it was Lotus  in particular Romain Grosjean  who provided the most serious if fleeting competition to Red Bull. Red Bull lodged a protest with the stewards referring the test to an FIA tribunal., A dominant Formula 1 champion the constructors title sewn up with three races to spare a rival that started well but faded and controversy engulfing a big team. The similarities between Max Verstappen and Red Bulls 2022 season and Sebastian Vettels allconquering 2013 campaign for the team are clear. The 2013 success was the fourth consecutive world championship double for Red Bull spearheaded by Vettel. That proved to be the end of an era whereas whats happening this year could perhaps be the early stages of one given Red Bulls strong start to F1s return to groundeffectdependent cars. But although the Red Bull of today has grown dramatically since 2013 annexing more and more of the Milton Keynes industrial estate it resides on over the years its still recognisably the same team. Adrian Newey is still the conceptual inspiration part of a far larger design group populated by exceptional personnel. Many of the engineering team have carried over and there are also familiar faces working on the cars in the garages. Newey indepth Aborted Ferrari switch Verstappen and retirement Read more And then just as now Red Bull was a team that relentlessly pushed the boundaries in F1. Thats the exact phrase team principal Christian Horner used after Red Bull bagged its personalbest 16th victory of the season at Suzuka when asked how proud he was of the team having won all but four of 2022s 20 races to date. Its something that the team can be incredibly proud of said Horner. There are a lot of people sitting around the engineering office and the garage and obviously back in the factory that are all the same people that did that with Sebastian and are doing it again with Max. The DNA of our team is that were a race team. Were a team of racers we push the boundaries were aggressive in the way that we go racing and we follow our passion that is to go out there and do our very very best. I guess there were risks today with the strategy that we took with the soft and maybe they could have run out of tyre. But we are following Dietrich Mateschitzs mantra of no risk no fun. This has certainly been an increasingly enjoyable season ontrack for Red Bull. As the year has progressed it has become more and more dominant. This year thats been at the expense of Ferrari which won two of the first three races with Charles Leclerc but has only added two victories since. In 2013 that role was played by Mercedes. Then Mercedes had yet to become the powerhouse F1 force it became in the hybrid era. The Silver Arrows claimed its first F1 victory since 1955 the previous season with Nico Rosberg and started 2013 strongly. Eight times in the first 11 races Mercedes took pole position  five of those for new arrival Lewis Hamilton the other three for Rosberg  although victories were a little harder to come by. Rosberg won in Monaco and Germany with Hamilton triumphing in Hungary. But the iconic moment was Hamiltons tyre shredding in Britain while leading prompting Pirelli to revert to the more robust 2012 tyres. That coincided with Red Bull really hitting its stride. Of course the Red Bull RB9 was strong from the start but it only got better as the season progressed. Vettel won all nine races after the August break a run Red Bull could repeat this year across the same number of races. The only difference is that Sergio Perezs win in Singapore means its not been Verstappen all the way. While Mercedes felt quietly encouraged that Red Bull pushed on to the end of the 2013 season given the imminent regulation change to hybrid engines one that required significant changes to the cars that are often overlooked it fell back. Late on it was Lotus  in particular Romain Grosjean  who provided the most serious if fleeting competition to Red Bull. The Mercedes W04 the first overseen by Mike Elliott  now Mercedes technical director then head of aero  was quick but rear tyre degradation was a problem. It was also a car Hamilton struggled to get the feel for meaning he faced a tough challenge from incumbent Rosberg. But it was quick it just wasnt as quick as the Red Bull. Reassessing Nico Rosberg  and how he beat Hamilton Read more The pattern is not dissimilar to that of 2022. Talk then was of a Mercedes title push in the first half of the year an idea that later seemed risible. The same could be said of Ferraris challenge this year which it now seems absurd to have taken seriously. Vettel also performed stunningly well in 2013. At one with team and car hardworking and capable of extracting tremendous pace from a car that produced more underfloor downforce than others without any of the downsides of the highrake concept. He also continued to benefit from exhaust blowing albeit in reduced form thanks to a series of rule changes that had gradually eroded its benefit. Like for Verstappen Vettel victories became inevitable. Whether leading from the front and keeping the competition just out of reach jumping ahead as other cars hit tyre trouble or even battling up the order as he did in India he was superb. Of course there was also the Multi 21 controversy in Malaysia when he overtook teammate Mark Webber against team orders such was his ruthless desire to win. Verstappen has done nothing like that this year but that neardesperation to keep racking up the victories is a factor both share. Verstappen shows no signs of easing off didnt even entertain the idea of potentially helping teammate Perez win the Mexican Grand Prix and likely wont be happy unless he adds wins number 15 and 16 to the tally in Brazil and Abu Dhabi. Hes also had to be even more versatile than Vettel in the way he has chased victories. Ferrari has more consistently started on pole position this year than the Mercedes did in 2013 and only five of Verstappens wins so far have come from first on the grid. One Spa came from 14th. As for the offtrack controversy in 2013 that engulfed Mercedes. It participated in an infamous secret tyre test at Barcelona. News of this test emerged during the Monaco Grand Prix weekend. Testing with the current years cars was banned but Pirelli wanted to run with a representative car after earlyseason tyre problems. Mercedes was set up to run at Barcelona as a result with FIA approval but rival teams were not informed. Red Bull lodged a protest with the stewards referring the test to an FIA tribunal. This reprimanded Mercedes and banned it from that seasons threeday young driver test because this track testing being carried out without the knowledge consent or participation of other teams. Pirelli was also reprimanded for conduct prejudicial to the championship and the secrecy of the test which race drivers Hamilton and Rosberg participated in. While perhaps not on the same scale the similarities to this years cost cap controversy are clear. It was certainly a huge talking point. Vettels Jekyll and Hyde career leaves him short of F1s elite Read more What is most striking about Red Bulls 2013 and Red Bulls 2022 is that on both occasions it was a team and driver very much at one supported by a capable number two driver producing a rare level of dominance. Such seasons may be criticised as boring or too easy. But while they may be too predictable and lack the intensity of the title fights that preceded them both in 2012 Vettel vs Alonso and 2021 Verstappen vs Hamilton they are far from easy to achieve. What we dont know is what follows. But while looming rule changes meant Red Bulls 2013 dominance was always potentially going to be interrupted the following season theres no reason why Red Bull cant be just as strong next year. And just as in 2013 whether or not intrigue will be restored likely relies on one of Mercedes or Ferrari upping their game.
Carlos Sainz: Ferrari driver 'had to reinvent myself' to challenge Charles Leclerc, https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/63498883, Ferrari have had an upanddown season but Carlos Sainz says they have stayed unitedCarlos Sainz is talking about reinvention about reconfiguring his entire approach to driving to try to get on terms with his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc this year. He fought for victory with Verstappen in Canada just losing out in a race Leclerc started from the back with an enginerelated grid penalty. After Silverstone Sainz outqualified Leclerc in Hungary Belgium the USA and at the last race in Mexico where Leclerc complained of engine problems. I dont know. To go through such a difficult season as we did with so few problems in the team is something to be valued., Ferrari have had an upanddown season but Carlos Sainz says they have stayed united Carlos Sainz is talking about reinvention about reconfiguring his entire approach to driving to try to get on terms with his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc this year. The 28yearold Spaniard has had a breakthrough season  taking his first pole position and his first win  but the big concern for this thoughtful perfectionist has been that for a long time in 2022 he struggled to meet his own high standards. It has been an extremely challenging season for me Sainz says. I found a lot of setbacks at the beginning of the year with this new car with the new regulations that didnt adapt to my driving style. I had to reinvent myself in many ways to try and find the pace. I didnt give up. I kept pushing even in the difficult moments and you can see it paying off now at the end of the season in terms of speed. Those few lines are Sainz in a nutshell  honest selfcritical humble determined hardworking. It can sound esoteric when a Formula 1 driver talks in this way  of driving style of struggling with his car. But these things really matter. Look at Red Bull where the car was heavy and somewhat ponderous at the beginning of the year. Max Verstappen was unable to exploit his extravagant skills to the point that  early in the season  he was barely quicker than teammate Sergio Perez. A bit of weight was taken out and the car came alive for the Dutchman who suddenly became effectively unbeatable. Or at McLaren where Daniel Ricciardos struggles with the cornerentry characteristics of the car left him so far adrift of Lando Norris the team terminated his contract a year early. A winner of eight grands prix all but one taken in swashbuckling style with Red Bull finds himself without a seat on the grid next year. At Ferrari Sainzs struggles manifested themselves in Leclercs overwhelming superiority in the first part of the season. The car has an oversteer balance  where the rear is loose and tends to move and slide  which Leclerc loved but Sainz could not handle as well. Leclerc outqualified Sainz in the first eight races in a row at an average advantage of 0.265 seconds as the older man struggled with the characteristics of the car. I have never been 0.20.3secs off any teammate in F1 and I can never accept that says Sainz who was actually marginally faster than Verstappen in qualifying when they were teammates at Toro Rosso at the beginning of their careers and neckandneck with Norris at McLaren in 201920. I always feel like I am quick in any kind of car and for the first time in my career I found myself with a very competitive car but one I didnt feel comfortable and natural with. I had to challenge myself and open up new roads of setup and driving style that I wish I didnt have to open because I wish everything had come a lot more natural and positively. But it happened this way and I stayed disciplined. I tried a lot of things and I made a lot of mistakes trying things. But it was all about trial and error and then coming back and discovering a new path that was a little step forward. A breakthrough and success Gradually things began to come together for Sainz. He fought for victory with Verstappen in Canada just losing out in a race Leclerc started from the back with an enginerelated grid penalty. Then at the British Grand Prix came that first pole won superbly in the wet with Leclerc third behind Verstappen. The maiden win also happened that weekend albeit only after Ferrari had scuppered Leclercs chances with a strategy error. And gradually the qualifying battle has shifted. After Silverstone Sainz outqualified Leclerc in Hungary Belgium the USA and at the last race in Mexico where Leclerc complained of engine problems. In that period the average gap between them has been only 0.013secs  still in Leclercs favour but so small as to be almost insignificant. Against a man some regard as perhaps the fastest in F1 over one lap it is some achievement. Im realistic Sainz says and I know how good Charles is in those conditions. This year he has been driving at a level that is very close to Max or any other driver. And for me hes in a way done a perfect season apart from the two or three typical mistakes everyone does in a year or the luck which maybe he has been lacking the same as me. I am not proud because I am not ahead. The day I am ahead in the statistics is the day I will be proud. Until then I will keep working at it keep finding lap time in myself. But its a statistic that makes me proud about the progress  not giving up not letting myself get comfortable with being 0.2secs behind and always challenging myself to find new ways of driving cars which is not easy. When you see other drivers on the grid you can see it is difficult to turn around a season or turn around the feeling with the car. You dont see it very often. The fact I managed to do that makes me happy. While Verstappen has won the title for the second successive year Sainz is sixth in the standings A lot of people dont perceive my speed Sainz says he does not like talking about his strengths as a driver because when he does he reads interviews back and regrets it. Every time I do an interview and say my positives and I read them I say Ah this sounds superarrogant. Maybe I go more towards the humble too much and stay in that way  modest. But whenever I see something a bit arrogant I kill myself for it. So I always like to let you guys give your opinion of what you see as my strengths while I criticise my weaknesses. Nevertheless like all F1 drivers he spends a lot of time analysing his qualities  good and bad. When told the qualifying statistics he said he knew them already. Of course I know he says. But he wouldnt bring it up in an interview unless explicitly asked. He accepts that may not always be to his benefit. A lot of people... sometimes they dont perceive my speed Sainz says. And I know how fast I am I just dont like talking about it. I dont give it value because if I know in myself and my engineers and the people I work with know it I dont need more people to know it. Maybe I am not doing myself any favours but it is how I am and I am not going to change. The race execution has been a weaker point For all the inner confidence he recognises too that he still has plenty to work on. Sainz beat Leclerc in Mexico but the strong trend this year is that Leclerc has been the faster Ferrari driver in races even in the second half of the season after Sainz made his progress in qualifying. Sainz is happy to admit that is an area in which he needs to progress. The race execution this year has been a weaker point of mine compared to the past he says. This year we are struggling a lot with tyre management on these new Pirelli tyres. The starts with this car for some reason have been extremely difficult and we have an inherent problem that doesnt allow us to get off the line as well as in previous years. With these tyres I dont control as well the tyre degradation and the race pace and its more difficult to be flexible and it doesnt open up as many strategy choices as I would like to have or as I had in the past with McLaren. These are points I am going to work on in the final races and into next season to be more complete. But as you said the qualifying gap has closed down a lot. I know Im up against one of the fastest qualifiers  if not the fastest qualifier  on the grid and so to be so close it makes me proud to know there has been a lot of effort put into it but also that its paying off. I am relatively coldblooded One aspect of race management though has certainly been a Sainz strength this year. In a season in which Ferraris strategy has been exposed  they have made a series of errors that have cost Leclerc big points  Sainz has been a shining light. On a number of occasions he has appeared to be running strategy from the cockpit contradicting his engineers and forcing them into changing their choices. One key example was in Monaco when he rejected their decision to come in for intermediate tyres as the track dried  something that wrecked Leclercs chances of victory  and instead insisted on staying out and changing straight to slicks. It secured him second place between the Red Bulls while Leclerc following instructions and changing to inters started a series of events that dropped him from the lead to fourth. Likewise at Silverstone after a safetycar period in which Ferraris decision not to pit Leclerc for fresh tyres led to him dropping from the lead to fourth Sainz refused  as politely as he could  an order to back up and create a gap to his teammate to protect him from those behind on the grounds that doing so would compromise both their races. This eased his path to victory as he passed Leclerc who then fought valiantly on his old tyres to delay Perez and Lewis Hamiltons Mercedes. Sainz says the ability to read the race from the car is both natural and something he actively tries to develop. I am relatively coldblooded in many aspects of life he says. Sometimes maybe too much. And I dont show maybe my tension passion. But it is also something I work on. Having a good fitness level always allows you to have more brain space when you are driving. Having good confidence with the car and yourself helps you to have more brain space to think about whats going on in the race. And I feel like I always have a clear mind when racing and I can identify the opportunities and the chances to know what is right or wrong from the inside of the cockpit that sometimes is the biggest challenge. I know its one of my strengths and I try to exploit it whenever I have a chance. Sainz says Ferrari want to take another step next season A year of realisation for Ferrari For Ferrari as a whole the season has been a rollercoaster. There is considerable satisfaction that they finally managed to return to competitiveness and that Leclerc was able to go toetotoe with Verstappen for the championship for a while. The cars outright speed is evident from the fact noone will be able to match Leclercs score of nine pole positions regardless of what happens in the final two races in Brazil and Abu Dhabi. But there is also an acknowledgement that mistakes and reliability problems torpedoed their chances questions as to why the car is rarely as effective in races as in qualifying and concern they have fallen behind in the development race just as they did the last time they had a competitive car in 2017 and 2018. There are definitely some mixed feelings in the team Sainz says. We are superproud of the progress we have done with the car to get back to where we are. But this has also been a year of realisation that there are still areas to work on and improve. We are being superdisciplined and supercoherent and ultracritical behind closed doors as to which areas we need to improve to match our competitors in certain areas or be better than them which has to be the target. The team is taking note of everything and we are going to try and take another step next year. Will it be enough I dont know. But its definitely a target. In the past a year such as this might have led to heads rolling at Ferrari. But Sainz says team principal Mattia Binotto has stuck to the noblame culture he is determined to engender after its success at Mercedes and Red Bull. Its incredibly difficult to execute and especially in a team like Ferrari where there is so much pressure and so much attention on us and everyone wants changes immediately as soon as something is wrong Sainz says. Mattia has done an excellent job at not losing the cool head at any point. We have had a lot of difficult moments a lot of criticism and he has remained stuck to his principles. Noone has been fired. We stayed united in the most difficult moments and it shows the progress of our culture. It is always exposed to criticism and high attention on all our mistakes. When we win its incredible  it is the best win in the world to win for Ferrari. To go through such a difficult season as we did with so few problems in the team is something to be valued.

Alonsos driving has been spectacular on occasions but the driver has suffered massively with reliability issues. At the Mexican GP last week the Spaniard was having a comfortable race at the head of the midfield but a late race power unit issue derailed things and forced a DNF. Alonso was livid after the race as he threw his gloves after getting off the car. Button Alonsos teammate during the infamous McLarenHonda stint said on Sky Sports F1s Any Driven Monday about Alonsos issues with his car Its a tricky one. Fernando seemed very positive on the radio when he came in for his tyre stop the team were like lets go for the hard it seems to be working and Fernando was like yeah lets do it. And he seemed really up for the challenge. So its amazing how quickly you can shift from having a great race to suddenly disaster and he had an issue with his power unit and then it finally let go coming into Turn 1 once he had already been overtaken by a couple of people and one being his teammate Esteban Ocon which you never like as a driver. So a toughie for Fernando and on the radio he was a calm Fernando compared to what weve seen before  but then he let it rip when he got out of the car. Fernando Alonso will make Aston Martin competitive Jenson Button has said that its tough to see a driver of Alonsos caliber face reliability issues. The former McLaren driver also added that Alonsos presence at Aston Martin would make make car more competitive. He said Its tough to see from a driver of his calibre having all these issues when hes driving still at his best at 41 years old. Hes such a talent still Fernando. Hes got so much passion and so much love for this sport as you see from his emotion. Its tough to see him in this situation. Im sure hes hoping next year he can find a package thats more reliable first of all and then he can sprinkle a bit of fairy dust which Im sure he will to make the Aston Martin car competitive. Alonso will move to Aston Martin from Alpine at the end of this season. It will be interesting to see how the AlonsoStroll partnership fares compared to the AlonsoOcon partnership at Alpine this season. Poll  0 votes

Magnussen: “No problem" with Hulkenberg as 2023 F1 teammate, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/magnussen-no-problem-hulkenberg-2023-teammate/10395329/, The choice of Hulkenberg is intriguing because he and Magnussen who is under contract for 2023 have had their moments of controversy in the past. Most famously back at the 2017 Hungarian Grand Prix Magnussen told Hulkenberg to suck my balls after they came to verbal blows following a laterace battle for a pointsscoring position. But with Magnussen and Hulkenberg having long moved on from that moment there is unlikely to be any lingering tensions. And Magnussen himself is clear that having someone alongside him with the kind of experience that Hulkenberg has would be a positive thing. I think Ive said many times now that I dont have a problem with Nico at all said the Dane., Listen to this article Haas is currently weighing up its driver options for the second seat in 2023 with it believed to be a straight call between retaining Mick Schumacher or going for the more experienced Hulkenberg. The choice of Hulkenberg is intriguing because he and Magnussen who is under contract for 2023 have had their moments of controversy in the past. Most famously back at the 2017 Hungarian Grand Prix Magnussen told Hulkenberg to suck my balls after they came to verbal blows following a laterace battle for a pointsscoring position. But with Magnussen and Hulkenberg having long moved on from that moment there is unlikely to be any lingering tensions. And Magnussen himself is clear that having someone alongside him with the kind of experience that Hulkenberg has would be a positive thing. I think Ive said many times now that I dont have a problem with Nico at all said the Dane. Actually I respect him as a racing driver. I dont really know him as a person. But certainly as a racing driver Ive always respected him. So I would have no problem. But I dont have an opinion on whether or not he should be in the second car. Mick is doing a good job at the moment. He had some issues in the beginning of the year and a few crashes but he is certainly faster now. Mick Schumacher Haas VF22 Kevin Magnussen Haas VF22 Photo by Steven Tee  Motorsport Images Hulkenberg has most recently been an F1 supersub and was last called up by Aston Martin to fill in for the unwell Sebastian Vettel at the Bahrain and Saudi Arabian Grands Prix. Speculation about him moving to Haas ramped up earlier this week when it emerged that Aston had signed Stoffel Vandoorne as a reserve for 2023. Speaking to Servus TV over the Mexican GP weekend Hulkenberg said he was upbeat about the progress of talks with Haas even if nothing was finalised. At the end of the day its not my decision he said. Im not making it. There are still talks going on. Im relatively optimistic but well have to be a little patient there. Schumacher is aware that time is running out for him to impress his Haas bosses enough to convince them to keep him for 2023. But he says it is pointless getting distracted by things that he cannot control so his sole focus is on delivering crucial points. Im here to do my job and Im here to do it well he said in Mexico. So thats what my main focus is on and thats everything that Im in control of. Im just trying to do my best and thats what Im here for.

This is De Vries' new manager on entering debut Formula 1 season, https://www.gpblog.com/en/news/154672/this-is-de-vries-new-manager-on-entering-debut-formula-1-season.html, Nyck de Vries has revealed in conversation with Ziggo Sport that he will have his interests looked after by Guillaume le Goff from this point onwards.

The Frenchman has been Pierre Gaslys manager for several years and will therefore also take De Vries under his wing. Previously the Dutchman did not have a manager. Article continues under ad His contract negotiations with AlphaTauri for the 2023 contract were therefore done entirely by De Vries himself. Next year as a rookie in the premier class there will be more demands on the 27yearold driver than ever so De Vries will be working with a manager for the first time. Le Goff is mainly expected to take many tasks off his hands. From now on I do have help from a management as it were. Personally I dont really like using that term because I still very much value my relationship between the team and myself. Nothing will change in that either but I do now have help from Guillaume le Goff who relieves me of everything De Vries told Jack Plooij in conversation. De Vries never felt the need for a manager because he wants to be directly connected in the team. He considers that important for personal relationships and a manager in between does not have a positive influence on that according to the upcoming AlphaTauri driver.

How F1 2022's top teams have approached a key packaging dilemma, https://the-race.com/formula-1/how-f1-2022s-top-teams-have-approached-a-key-packaging-dilemma/, But looking at the Red Bull we can see the bulge in the body surface for the outer end of the lower SIPS clearly. The illustration shows the outer ends of both the upper and lower SIPS. I have highlighted with a red circle where the end of the upper SIPS should be. The lower one is between the lower surface of the underfloor and the upper surface of the underfloor and the upper one is between the inner surface of the radiator inlet duct and the upper surface of the sidepod. So it will be 2023 before we see which of these top three teams went down the right route initially., You never know how your egg is boiled until you crack open the shell and its similar with Formula 1 cars. Theres a reason for everything when it comes to packaging the thousands of parts that make up the car and things arent always as they appear before you break through the shell. The Side Impact Protection System SIPS is as the name suggests there to protect the driver in a side impact. This is mainly for accidents involving a sideon impact with a barrier or wall rather than another car although they will also be of use in that style of accident. There are two of these that must be placed in a certain position relative to the cockpit opening one low down and the other higher up. As we can clearly see on the Mercedes the upper one red arrow is entirely separate from the sidepod and used as the rearview mirror mount. The lower one blue arrow is more difficult to spot but I wouldnt be surprised if this detail on the sidepod is the outer end of it. But looking at the Red Bull we can see the bulge in the body surface for the outer end of the lower SIPS clearly. The illustration shows the outer ends of both the upper and lower SIPS. I have highlighted with a red circle where the end of the upper SIPS should be. The lower one is between the lower surface of the underfloor and the upper surface of the underfloor and the upper one is between the inner surface of the radiator inlet duct and the upper surface of the sidepod. Both are very neatly packaged between two body surfaces. On the Ferrari illustration we can only see one which is nearer to the middle of the sidepod vertically. There are no bumps or bulges for the outer ends of either top or bottom SIPS but they are inside there somewhere. Perhaps this is why the Ferrari sidepods are relatively fairly bulbous in this area Mercedes chose to have one of its SIPS cones as a standalone component Red Bull packaged these so tightly that the end of the bottom one needed a bulge while Ferrari simply enclosed them in bodywork. As I said you never know how well the egg is boiled until you crack the shell and its too late if its not to your liking by then. In the case of these three teams they didnt know what the others had come up with until the cars broke cover this season. And relocating the SIPS cones is a very difficult and expensive thing to do. Gary Andersons take on F1 tyre blanket ban amid driver backlash Read more It would require a revised chassis structure in that area to withstand the loads and also a new underfloor and sidepods. With the budget cap restricting spending all of that would just be too much. Packaging an F1 car is no easy task and we have on occasion seen problems arising from it being a bit too compact. But under normal circumstances and considering where they are located on the car wrapping things like the SIPS structures as tightly as possible has been the norm for many years. If I was looking at concepts for next year it would be a combination of the lower one from Red Bull and the upper one from Mercedes. That doesnt mean the Ferrari one isnt the best but it does look like it makes the sidepod a bit more cumbersome. So it will be 2023 before we see which of these top three teams went down the right route initially.
OPINION: Verstappen and Red Bull don't get enough credit what they are doing is remarkable, https://racingnews365.com/opinion-verstappen-and-red-bull-dont-get-enough-credit-what-they-are-doing-is-remarkable, When Max Verstappen crossed the line at the end of the Mexican Grand Prix he did something no other driver has ever done in the history of Formula 1. It was found that Red Bull went over the 145 million budget cap for 2021 which on the face of it would suggest they gained an unfair advantage. Red Bull are the only privateer team capable of winning races in F1. Hes previously overstepped the line with his rogue marshal comments during qualifying for the 2021 Qatar Grand Prix. But hes got it right this time  Verstappen and Red Bull are unfairly being treated., When Max Verstappen crossed the line at the end of the Mexican Grand Prix he did something no other driver has ever done in the history of Formula 1. It was his 14th win in a single season surpassing the record previously held by Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel. By comparison Lewis Hamilton has only ever reached 11 wins in a season during 2014 which was matched again in 18 19 and 20. After the long period of Mercedes dominance 2022 was the time to show what Verstappen has been waiting for ever since he became F1s youngest race winner on his Red Bull debut at the Spanish Grand Prix in 2016. There were races that year which showed how ruthless he could be with the established order of drivers an example of which being the rainsoaked Brazilian Grand Prix. It was a stunning performance highlighted by the outrageous overtaking move around the outside of soontobe World Champion Nico Rosberg in the tricky conditions. At that time the talk of him being a future World Champion was ripe. So now that weve got to this point why has he suddenly become the pantomime villain  XPBimages Horner is right to point out mental health effects of cost cap saga The 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix wasnt a conventional ending for a season to say the least but Verstappen still proved his worth as a champion by winning nine other races prior to the finale. For some this championship still has an asterisk which was fuelled even more by this seasons cost cap story. It was found that Red Bull went over the 145 million budget cap for 2021 which on the face of it would suggest they gained an unfair advantage. If one examines the details the team were actually under the budget cap by 4 million and the overspend was due to a disputed amount relating to four key areas. The FIA themselves confirmed the team did not act fraudulently or in bad faith with Team Principal Christian Horner pointing out that the overspend did not amount to more performance for their car. But it didnt stop the allegations of Red Bull being branded cheaters with Horner saying the saga was having effects on the mental health of team members  and even their children. The damage that that does to the brand to our partners to our drivers to our workforce in an age where mental health is prevalent were seeing significant issues he told media including RacingNews365.com. Within our workforce we are having kids that are being bullied in playgrounds that are employees children  that is not right through fictitious allegations from other teams. The idea that Horner would gaslight members of his team to avoid criticism is abject nonsense. One has to remember that F1 teams are spending months away from their families during the everexpanding calendar in the pursuit to win races and championships. To be branded cheaters or for there to be constant digging from broadcasters at Verstappens title legitimacy is insulting to the people that are working the hours to make it happen behind the scenes. More of a concerted effort to recognise Verstappens greatness Prior to the 2021 season it was Hamilton and Mercedes who were on the receiving end of boos from the fans with Vettel and Schumacher also getting the same treatment during their years of success for simply being dominant and winning most of the races. I can remember the 2013 British Grand Prix where fans wanted anyone but Vettel to win and when he did retire in front of the grandstand I was sitting in people cheered as if Hamilton had just overtaken two cars in one corner. It is rather sad that in the very moment athletes and team personnel are achieving their lifelong ambitions  for which they have made untold sacrifices for in the pursuit of  public opinion can turn on them. Red Bull are the only privateer team capable of winning races in F1. Outside of the championship they do not really have any other income in the same way that Mercedes or Ferrari do with their car companies. If anything they are the underdogs in all this in the same way Racing Point were when they won their first race through Sergio Perez at the 2020 Sakhir Grand Prix. To an extent Red Bulls domination in 2022 is unsurprising for those that know where their strengths have always lay. Theyve always been the best chassis makers on the grid which is why neither Mercedes or Ferrari were willing to supply them with an engine when they separated from Renault during the early days of the hybrid era. That being said Horner is no angel. Hes previously overstepped the line with his rogue marshal comments during qualifying for the 2021 Qatar Grand Prix. But hes got it right this time  Verstappen and Red Bull are unfairly being treated. Verstappen will no doubt remain a perennial title contender for years to come and will continue to develop as a driver so there should be more of a concerted effort to enjoy his remarkable achievements at just 25 years old.
F1-backed female series ‘only a positive’ says W Series driver Hawkins, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/f1-female-series-positive-hawkins/10395055/, The F1backed female series would not be designed to replace W Series given it will use Formula 4 machinery and be targeted at a younger generation of drivers. W Series has used Formula 3 cars since its inaugural season in 2019. Hawkins has raced in all three seasons of W Series to date as well as serving as an ambassador for Aston Martins Formula 1 team. I also would like to think that it would work alongside W Series. W Series has helped make that happen but were just a bit later on., Listen to this article Over the United States Grand Prix weekend last month it emerged that F1 was planning to launch its own allfemale racing series as early as next year serving as a potential feeder series into Formula 3 and Formula 2. It came just weeks after W Series was forced to call off the final three rounds of its 2022 season due to fundraising issues instead turning its attention to securing back for the 2023 championship. The F1backed female series would not be designed to replace W Series given it will use Formula 4 machinery and be targeted at a younger generation of drivers. W Series has used Formula 3 cars since its inaugural season in 2019. Hawkins has raced in all three seasons of W Series to date as well as serving as an ambassador for Aston Martins Formula 1 team. Although F1 is yet to formally confirm any details for its planned series Hawkins said she can only see it as a positive as it gives more racing opportunities to women trying to get up the ladder. Any championship that helps females out I think should be welcomed and we should do everything that we can to welcome it said Hawkins. I also would like to think that it would work alongside W Series. I would hate to think they would ever be competing against each other because thats not what were fight for here. Its not whos got the best championship its how do we work together because were all trying to achieve the same thing. I think its a positive thing. Start grid Photo by Sam Bloxham  Motorsport Images Hawkins felt it was important for a greater focus on grassroots level to get more women racing helping increase the pool of drivers and had a wider impact similar to the England womens football team that won the Euro 2022 championship. The less that we have the less chance there is going to be that a female is going to be making it to Formula 1 said Hawkins. So lets address the issue get as many in as we can appeal to the younger generation get as many as we can in at grassroots level and in a few years time well see the reward of that like the Lionesses. Yes were seeing the reward of the amazing work that the current Lionesses are doing. But were actually gaining from the work that was done five 10 15 years ago. The Lionesses could have won the Euros 20 years ago but I bet no one would have heard about it. But because of the work that was done by those 20 years ago now were enjoying it and hearing about it so much. W Series has helped make that happen but were just a bit later on. Were going to see the reward of that in a few years time.

Norris Eyeing Up Future Opportunities to Race Outside F1, https://www.wtf1.com/post/norris-eyeing-up-future-opportunities-to-race-outside-f1/, Lando Norris has been a man in demand in 2022. On that occasion Norris hopes of longdistance racing glory went up in smoke as his LMP2 race car suffered mechanical issues. However the young Brit has now suggested that this experience has whetted his appetite to sample more racing outside of F1. I would love to drive more I would love to get more opportunities Norris told Racer. Would you like to see F1 drivers dabble in other racing series offseason, Lando Norris has been a man in demand in 2022. Not only has he raised his stock by outperforming teammate Daniel Ricciardo in another impressive F1 campaign but the Brit revealed this week that he had spoken to Red Bull before resigning for McLaren. Agreed earlier this year the renewal is set to keep Lando in a papaya race suit until 2025 but it appears that hes already got his eyes peeled for chances to compete elsewhere in the years to come. In 2018 the McLaren man took part in the 24 Hours of Daytona with fellow F1 star Fernando Alonso and veteran endurance racer Phil Hanson for Zak Browns United Autosports team. On that occasion Norris hopes of longdistance racing glory went up in smoke as his LMP2 race car suffered mechanical issues. However the young Brit has now suggested that this experience has whetted his appetite to sample more racing outside of F1. I would love to drive more I would love to get more opportunities Norris told Racer. Formula 1 is my life at the minute I understand that. But doing the Daytona 24 hours and things like that I would love to do and Im sure in maybe 10 or 20 years I will have that opportunity or more opportunities to do it. Given that F1s new record 24race calendar is set to put the endurance of Lando and all his fellow drivers to the test next year he says downtime will be at a premium. Understandably when he does get a break the 22yearold expects hell just want to go away and forget about Formula 1 before coming back to it and he doesnt plan on racing in other series alongside F1. On the other hand with McLaren venturing into series like IndyCar and his teammate recently getting to demo a NASCAR he says he has started thinking about other vehicles hed like to drive. He Ricciardo got to drive the number three Dale Earnhardt car I dont really have anyone Ive looked up to like Daniel and Earnhardt he added. Maybe Ill try a motorbike but I probably wouldnt be able to come back to four wheels if I went motorbiking because Id crash For the time being Lando says hes committed to F1. That said hes got plenty of time left in his career to try out other categories. Maybe MotoGP should be off the cards though.  Would you like to see F1 drivers dabble in other racing series offseason
The one F1 record Verstappen will not be able to break in 2022, https://racingnews365.com/the-one-f1-record-verstappen-will-not-be-able-to-break-in-2022, With 14 Formula 1 Grand Prix wins and counting in the 2022 season Max Verstappen is in uncharted territory. However while this record is certainly attainable there is one that Verstappen will not be able to claim  no matter what he does. The record Verstappen cant break With the F1 calendar expanding in recent years the total number of race wins in a season has become an easier target. However Ascaris score is set to remain unbeatable to have beaten his tally Verstappen would have needed 17 wins from the season. In the first 10 seasons of the World Championship F1 drivers didnt bother with a trip to Indiana but in 1952 Ascari did just that with Ferrari., With 14 Formula 1 Grand Prix wins and counting in the 2022 season Max Verstappen is in uncharted territory. His win in the Mexican Grand Prix eclipsed the tally of 13 victories  the record jointly held by Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel  as the Red Bull driver continued to impose his dominance on the campaign. He can potentially claim the largest margin between P1 and P2 in the Drivers Championship with his gap to Sergio Perez currently standing at 136 points. The alltime record is 155 points held by Vettel in his 2013 campaign over Fernando Alonso meaning that Verstappen needs to outscore Perez by 20 points in the final two race weekends. However while this record is certainly attainable there is one that Verstappen will not be able to claim  no matter what he does. The record Verstappen cant break With the F1 calendar expanding in recent years the total number of race wins in a season has become an easier target. Mick Schumacher even said after Mexico that he expected his fathers record to be beaten given the fact that there are more races these days than compared to Michaels era. With that in mind the metric of total percentage wins in a season has become more useful to measure a drivers success. However despite winning 14 of 20 races in 2022 and potentially even 16 of 22 Verstappen will fall short of taking a record that has stood since 1952  the third year of the World Championship  as the table below shows. Highest driver win percentages Year Driver Races Wins Percentage wins 1952 Alberto Ascari 8 6 75 2004 Michael Schumacher 18 13 72.22 1963 Jim Clark 10 7 70 2022 Max Verstappen 20 14  up to Mexican GP 70 2013 Sebastian Vettel 19 13 68.42 1954 Juan Manuel Fangio 9 6 66.67 2002 Michael Schumahcer 17 11 64.71 2020 Lewis Hamilton 17 11 64.71 Verstappens tally As it stands with 14 wins from 20 races Verstappen has a 70 win rate. Should he take victories in Brazil and Abu Dhabi for a score of 16 from 22 this will climb to 72.72  and move him into second on the list behind Alberto Ascaris record of 75 from 1952. However Ascaris score is set to remain unbeatable to have beaten his tally Verstappen would have needed 17 wins from the season. Ascaris record is also unique as he also competed in the Indy 500 that year. In the first 10 seasons of the World Championship F1 drivers didnt bother with a trip to Indiana but in 1952 Ascari did just that with Ferrari. As a result he missed the seasonopener in May 1952 in Switzerland before finishing 31st in the 500 itself. Upon returning to the F1 scene he would not be beaten across the rest of the season winning all six races from the Belgian Grand Prix. With the 1953 Indy 500 aside Ascari would win every race from Belgium 1952 to Belgium 1953 with the run coming to an end in France 1953 when Mike Hawthorn claimed the first World Championship victory for a British driver with Ascari only fourth.
F1 News: Sebastian Vettel cannot rule out F1 comeback, https://www.si.com/fannation/racing/f1briefings/news/f1-news-sebastian-vettel-cannot-rule-out-f1-comeback-jd22, Sebastian Vettel has admitted that he cannot completely rule out an eventual F1 comeback although he hopes to find new passions and interests elsewhere. Vettels F1 career is among the most decorated in the sports history with Championships race wins and Pole Positions becoming almost habitual for the German driver at one stage. Speaking in an interview with Der Spiegel Vettel explained that an eventual F1 return is not out of the question  but he hopes to find fulfilment beyond the sportId like to rule it out. As far as the physical is concerned I do a sport that you could still return to after a twoyear break. However there is no guarantee that Vettel will be interested in an F1 return as he explores other interests beyond the sport., Sebastian Vettel has admitted that he cannot completely rule out an eventual F1 comeback although he hopes to find new passions and interests elsewhere. Vettels F1 career is among the most decorated in the sports history with Championships race wins and Pole Positions becoming almost habitual for the German driver at one stage. His years with Red Bull were among the most dominant in the sports history but the 4time Champion is now ready to turn the page and embark on a new chapter. Aston Martins lack of competitiveness is generally described as a factor in Vettels decision to retire. However the Germans passion and intensity continue to burn even as this year comes to an end. Speaking in an interview with Der Spiegel Vettel explained that an eventual F1 return is not out of the question  but he hopes to find fulfilment beyond the sport Id like to rule it out. But I cant. I have no idea how Ill be ticking in a year or two motorsporttotal quotes him as saying. As far as the physical is concerned I do a sport that you could still return to after a twoyear break. However I hope that in two years I can say No thanks I dont need racing anymore. Im not sure if I want to see the races at all after retirement. Formula 1 was my life purpose for 16 years. Now I secretly expect myself to cope without Formula 1  like Im going into rehab. If you like something you can also be attached to it. I want to go the other way detach myself and find out there are other exciting things. Fernando Alonso has demonstrated that F1s elite drivers can find their best form even after spending time on the sidelines so Vettel is almost certainly capable of engineering a return to the grid. However there is no guarantee that Vettel will be interested in an F1 return as he explores other interests beyond the sport.
Lewis Hamilton drops hint: “I'm working on a plan - I can't tell you yet…”, https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1016365/1/lewis-hamilton-drops-hint-i-m-working-plan-i-can-t-tell-you-yet, The 37yearold is widely expected to renew his contract with Mercedes which currently expires at the end of F1 2023.

Im generally loving driving so Im working on a plan., The 37yearold is widely expected to renew his contract with Mercedes which currently expires at the end of F1 2023. But he has now dropped an interesting hint on the nature of a new deal. Is Hamilton No Longer the Best Wet Weather Driver Video of Is Hamilton No Longer the Best Wet Weather Driver In terms of my physical wellbeing I feel the best Ive physically ever been because Ive been really focused on that as you get older Hamilton said. Im generally loving driving so Im working on a plan. I cant tell you what that is just yet but there is no limit to what we can do I want to be creative and continue to do all the other things I get to do. I get to be myself at this team  and the support from Mercedes has been incredible since day one. Together its not just about winning we can be part of the many people in the world that are trying to change the world for the better  and thats what we can try and do together as its a huge brand that can have a huge influence on the world. Hamilton sits fifth in the F1 standings and with two races left in 2022 is facing the first winless season of his esteemed career. George Russell his teammate is fourth. Hamilton said In terms of George joining he was one of the younger drivers  he would sit behind in debriefs and engineering so he knows the process and the lay of the land here. He comes in and slots in he knows what to expect. And from my side Ive just tried to be as welcoming and include him  trying to communicate a lot about the car what can I test what can you test to get us to point A I just try to work with him as I did with Valtteri Bottas. When you add new people it takes time to all get into the rhythm but I think hes done an amazing job we got into a decent rhythm quite early on and were continuing to work out any kinks there to continue to be on that rhythm. Hamilton has vowed to return to the title fight in 2023 and challenge Max Verstappen again.

More recently Mercedes has emerged as Red Bulls main threat at some races with Ferraris F175 particularly lacking performance last time out in Mexico. This has come with Mercedes overcoming the early bouncing problems that plagued its W13 and being able to finally unlock the potential it knew was always in the car. Mercedes progress points to the team being back in contention for wins next year as it looks poised to switch some key concepts of its challenger. That could leave Ferrari facing another season of disappointment having failed to capitalise on having the best package at the start of this year. But Ferrari team principal Binotto thinks the current competitive picture between his outfit and Mercedes does not reflect the true situation for next year as Maranello switched off development of its 2022 car early to shift its focus to next year. Mercedes is coming back right as they have developed the car more than we did he said after Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc finished fifth and sixth in Mexico. We know as well ourselves that we stopped quite early the development of that car to focus on 2023. So Im not too concerned by the rate of development because I know as well when we stopped developing it. Ferrari has not won a race since the Austrian Grand Prix in July when Leclerc came through to beat Max Verstappen. Since then Red Bull has won every grand prix.

Japan was in the wet and we were not as fast but it was not a drama and certainly not in the quali. In the States Austin I think that in the quali we were competitive but not as much as we would have expected in the race. In Mexico its a lot worse but I dont think its the same trend because Singapore competitive Japan not too bad USA good quali. But the duty is first to try to analyse whats going on and what has been the main issues here in Mexico and try to be back competitive for what is our level of competitiveness at least for the last two races including Sao Paulo. So we hope certainly to be there and to fight for a better result.

Ricciardo reveals help from psychologist - “I was neglecting friendships”, https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1016199/1/ricciardo-reveals-help-psychologist-i-was-neglecting-friendships, The veteran Australian has now revealed how his ontrack struggles followed him in his personal life too.  F1 2022 Video of Daniel Ricciardo  WHERE NEXT  F1 2022Whenever we thought we would found a solution along would come another set of challenges he told the Daily Mail. I was neglecting friendships and thought it would be good to talk to someone to make sure the two sides of my life didnt cross over. It would be good to get next year sorted before the final race in Abu Dhabi he said., Ricciardo wont be in the F1 2023 driver lineup after McLaren opted to terminate his contract a year early and replace him with rookie Oscar Piastri as a result of his poor form. The veteran Australian has now revealed how his ontrack struggles followed him in his personal life too. Daniel Ricciardo  WHERE NEXT  F1 2022 Video of Daniel Ricciardo  WHERE NEXT  F1 2022 Whenever we thought we would found a solution along would come another set of challenges he told the Daily Mail. When you put so much into something and it doesnt work out there is sadness. It gets to you. Last year it affected me a little bit too much. I wouldnt be my usual bubbly self. I would be reluctant if someone said lets go out for dinner. I would need some cajoling. I let it get to me. I started to speak to a psychologist last year. The most challenging year I have had. Racing is very much results driven and dictates your Sunday happiness. I was neglecting friendships and thought it would be good to talk to someone to make sure the two sides of my life didnt cross over. You need perspective. And with the calendar being so long it was hard to remove yourself from what was happening in the racing. Ricciardo is 12th in the F1 standings after being drastically outperformed by Lando Norris in 2022. McLaren opted not to keep him for 2023 and he has not found an agreement to stay on the grid with another team. It is fair to say it was unexpected given I was on a threeyear deal that had a year to run he said about McLarens decision. It is not something you can prepare for. But Id already had some honest discussions with Andreas Seidl team principal and Zak Brown chief executive earlier in the year to see what we could do to improve things. It was a concern on both sides. I didnt want to keep coming 14th or 15th. I kept the faith that something would click. But it hadnt happened by midseason and they took the decision they did. It put me in a tough position of thinking What next Ricciardo has confirmed that he remains in talks with F1 teams about a different role reportedly as a reserve driver. He has been heavily linked with Mercedes as backup to Lewis Hamilton and George Russell. It would be good to get next year sorted before the final race in Abu Dhabi he said.
Lewis Hamilton snubbed again as Sebastian Vettel changes his mind on F1 GOAT debate, https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/f1-goat-hamilton-schumacher-vettel-28414447, Michael is my hero for that reason I probably dont want Lewis to win he said last December. In a way I would be happy if Michaels record still stands but even if Lewis wins to me Michael is still the greatest. Lewis can win one more two more three more five more championships  it doesnt change anything for me. Asked again for his verdict on that most controversial of questions Vettel now believes the GOAT to be fivetime champion Juan Manuel Fangio. Im a fan of Michael Schumacher but Fangio is a little better... the best the best the king said Vettel., Vettel previously named Michael Schumacher as the best F1 driver of all time in his opinion but it seems he has since changed his mind while still ignoring Hamilton Sebastian Vettel has changed his mind on who he believes to be the Formula 1 GOAT  but like last time he avoided choosing Lewis Hamilton. The fourtime world champion knows more than most what it takes to be among the F1 elite. Vettel will retire later this month as one of the most decorated racers the sport has ever seen boasting 53 race wins and 112 podiums as well as those four consecutive drivers titles. Last year on the eve of the titledeciding Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Vettel made it clear who he believed to be the greatest driver the sport has ever seen. No matter whether or not Hamilton got the better of Max Verstappen last year he still advocated for his countryman Michael Schumacher. Michael is my hero for that reason I probably dont want Lewis to win he said last December. But the truth is they both had a strong season and they are going into the last race with the opportunity to win the championship because they both deserve it. In a way I would be happy if Michaels record still stands but even if Lewis wins to me Michael is still the greatest. Lewis can win one more two more three more five more championships  it doesnt change anything for me. Those comments made clear his unwavering belief in that point of view but it seems something may have changed over the last 12 months. Asked again for his verdict on that most controversial of questions Vettel now believes the GOAT to be fivetime champion Juan Manuel Fangio. Image Mirrorpix Mirrorpix The Argentine competed in a vastly different era of the sport winning 24 races in 51 starts on the way to five world championships in the 1950s. Im a fan of Michael Schumacher but Fangio is a little better... the best the best the king said Vettel. The German also went on to give his verdict on Verstappen who may well enter the GOAT debate one day after romping to 2022 title  the second of his career  aged 25. I think hes had a hell of a season so hopefully he goes on and get 16 wins by the end of the year because anything else will be a disappointment Vettel added. It is great for Red Bull and I still know some people there so I am really happy for them. Obviously they have a lot of momentum from last year and the car this year is incredible. They won races even though they were heavier than anybody else and I think now theyve finally got the weight out. So the car is there but Max is doing an amazing job as well.

He picked up another penalty point in Austin for going off the track and keeping the position. Eight points Yuki Tsunoda Two of Tsunodas points will expire in November after colliding with Stroll at the 2021 Brazilian GP. He also got two points for colliding with Vettel in Jeddah while in 2022 he picked up another two for spinning teammate Gasly at Silverstone. His final two came at Monza for now slowing down sufficiently for yellow flags. Ten points Pierre Gasly Gasly is just two points away from receiving a race ban. Collisions with Stroll and Vettel in Spain and Austria respectively resulted in four penalty points. One point in Austria for leaving the track without a justifiable reason multiple times. In recent races he picked up two in Japan for speeding under red flag conditions while at COTA he fell more than 10 car lengths behind the Safety Car. Finally in Mexico he went off track while overtaking Stroll resulting in another penalty point.
failed yet fruitful Alpine F1 seat pitch that began on Instagram, https://the-race.com/formula-1/the-failed-yet-fruitful-alpine-2023-pitch-that-began-on-instagram/, Jack Doohan has not managed to get an Alpine Formula 1 drive for 2023. And while Alpine has unsurprisingly gone for a more experienced option for its 2023 race seat in Pierre Gasly Doohans efforts have still been worthwhile. So I actually sent him a DM on Instagram  basically this huge big long paragraph saying why I think I could be a candidate going forward. He took his first feature race win at Spa  which was the sort of message ontrack that he was telegraphing to Alpine offtrack. At that point in time ninth in Formula 2 and not really in a position to go to Formula 1., Jack Doohan has not managed to get an Alpine Formula 1 drive for 2023. But its not for the lack of trying. F1s newest free practice debutant is now frontandcentre in Alpines junior programme following the messy Oscar Piastri saga. Doohan had more nerves chasing Alpine seat than FP1 debut Read more That might have seemed like a natural progression given he was the highestplaced Alpine protege in the junior ranks when it became clear Piastri would be leaving the team but whatever it owes to circumstance it owes an equal amount to Doohans impressive proactivity. From sending Alpine CEO Laurent Rossi direct messages on social media to emailing Alpines lead engineer on the first weekend after the summer break Doohan did all he could to shape his own destiny. And while Alpine has unsurprisingly gone for a more experienced option for its 2023 race seat in Pierre Gasly Doohans efforts have still been worthwhile. On the night that all that news broke I didnt have Laurents number or anything Doohan says. So I actually sent him a DM on Instagram  basically this huge big long paragraph saying why I think I could be a candidate going forward. And he replied at like 3am  I think he was in the US or somewhere  with his number at the bottom and that wed chat in the coming days. Then I think I spoke to Otmar Szafnauer the following night briefly. And every day I was kind of trying to speak to whoever I can in all parts of the Formula 1 team and all parts of the structure for the Academy. It was an opportunity and even if it was a farfetched one at least now with the seat closed off and Pierre taking it I know that Im not sitting here going I wish I pushed a little bit more I wish I tried. Alonsos 2022 misery has a silver lining  but not for him Read more For a solid six weeks I was doing absolutely everything I can to try and secure myself in the seat. Sure it didnt work out as hoped. But it had its upsides. Doohan was only ninth in Formula 2 heading into F1s summer break. He took his first feature race win at Spa  which was the sort of message ontrack that he was telegraphing to Alpine offtrack. If hed been off Alpines radar before August the team quickly discovered how serious Doohan was. It has been impressed by how he conducted himself and the way he behaved certainly didnt hurt his chances of replacing Piastri in the Friday practice sessions Alpine had lined up for its reserve driver. In Doohans words good things came out of it. After making his pitch to Alpines most senior figures he sought to embed himself in the team more which also aided his Formula 2 campaign. It had flickered into life just before the summer break but has enjoyed a sustained improvement since everything kicked off at Alpine at the start of August even if some circumstances have stopped Doohan from turning that into as many points as he should have. Whats going on with Piastris Alpine F1 exit Read more From the moment it all happened I was pushing on every aspect that I could to try and secure a position in Formula 1 Doohan says. And as we got to Spa I was speaking with the team as well. At that point in time ninth in Formula 2 and not really in a position to go to Formula 1. And the guys were saying its probably highly unlikely well focus on Formula 2. On Friday morning at Spa I emailed the chief engineer Ciaron Pilbeam and I said do you mind if I sit in on the preFP1 briefing And he said yeah for sure. I started from there kind of embedding myself more into the team and really trying to understand how the weekend falls into place and and basically trying to take in as much information as I can. Honestly I think when I was coming back to Formula 2 things were just so much more simple. The information coming from engineer to driver and everything that I was taking in was so much less. I think that was helping me as well. I saw that I had an opportunity to go to Formula 1. So I was going if I just enjoy this and it happens I do have a chance here. Whereas before I was obviously behind Oscar and it was maybe looking more like a twoyear project. Why Alpine thinks Gaslys a better fit than Alonso or Piastri Read more It still might be in the sense Doohan is heading for a second year in Formula 2. But if thats the case it will be with the knowledge he is at the front of the Alpine queue having made a real impression on the people in charge and has developed into a driver who will start 2023 as the title favourite. From how he conducted himself during the peak of the Piastri saga to his preparation for his FP1 debut in Mexico and his general offtrack attitude Doohans earned plenty of plaudits internally at Alpine. Team principal Otmar Szafnauer says Doohans preparation was exemplary going in wanting to know everything before Mexico and sporting director Alan Permane reckons Doohans character might prove to be an ace up the sleeve. What impresses me most about Jack honestly is out of the car says Permane. His preparation the work he does behind the scenes. Hed never driven here and there hadnt been a plan for him to drive here. And a few weeks ago he was in Brisbane doing some F2 sponsor commitments and we told him he was going to be driving in Mexico. He flew back to the UK did a day in the sim and then came onwards to Austin and here. So thats what impresses me most  his preparation. Theres no doubt about his speed. When he makes it to Formula 1 thatll be a nice differentiator for him.

Like millions of new F1 fans Sam and I started watching Netflixs Drive to Survive in early lockdowns., You will hear a Formula 1 car before you see it. You will feel it before you see it. Theres almost a sense of foreshadowing of air being sucked back down the track. The highpitched scream rises eats into your eardrums until suddenly in a visceral release it rockets past. Neeeuuummm Instantly its gone again like a fighter jet on rails. F1 cars are so fast so low to the ground the drivers head is at roughly hip height its breathtaking. If a couple race past together a drivers exhaust sparks or someone locks up the brakes the whiff of fuel and rubber follows on a trailing wind. Its sport Jim but not as Ive known it.

But walking into Italys fabled Monza circuit with my 12yearold son Sam the reality blows that away. We first hear the roars outside the park. As we move closer to our stand in a sea of Ferrari Red and Red Bull blue the noise swells. Practice is underway a helicopter flies overhead and the cars are milling around the Autodromo Nazionale Monza at up to 347kmh. Stepping through the gigantic steel bleachers we see the track on the other side of a fence  astonishingly what feels like a few metres away. A F1 car flies by with such volume and pace I wince and take a step back. Theres another. And another. Then an extra energy ripples through the crowd. A bright red car approaches. Its Charles Leclercs Ferrari and fans go ballistic. He thunders past the tifosi and they react like football supporters whose team has scored a matchwinning goal. And this is just a practice session.

The autodromo threads through one of Europes largest parks lots of walking is involved and its surrounded not just by grandstands but a fanzone DJs and stalls selling food drink and walletbusting merch an official baseball cap costs 60 a hoodie 180. The main event is of course Sundays race but Grands Prix stretch over three or four days including free practice sessions a qualifying hour that decides the grid starting order and a host of other races vintage car parades and sideshows in between. Its a fun friendly vibe with far more kids families and women than youd find at say a Premier League match. And the waves of red around leave little doubt that most are shouting for Ferrari. Our trip began when we couldnt travel at all. Like millions of new F1 fans Sam and I started watching Netflixs Drive to Survive in early lockdowns. When the 2020 season kicked off under empty stands we bought a sports TV subscription to watch it. The strategy the speed the crashes the characters the rivalries  we were hooked and our interest has only grown over the two seasons since. Expand Close Sam among the home crowd  Facebook Twitter Email Whatsapp Sam among the home crowd Were not alone. Around us in Monza I hear a surprising amount of Irish accents and see a couple of GAA jerseys. The epic 2021 rivalry between Red Bulls Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes which controversially came down to the last lap amped up the drama. Young fans have found young drivers like Leclerc Lando Norris and Mick Schumacher relatable. Theyre on TikTok and Insta. F1s popularity is catching fire in the lucrative US market with tickets for a new Las Vegas Grand Prix including The Strip next year starting from 500. Suddenly it seems everyone wants a piece of this sport. Of course F1 can be boring too. Theyre just going around in circles Sams sister sometimes chides. Shes right... technically. Its also true that sustainability sportswashing there are races in Saudi Arabia and Qatar for example and rule confusion threaten its credibility. But we also see scintillating speed strategy and skill within those circles. Variables like weather pit stops tyres and track differences throw up unknowns. There are only 20 drivers and they speak their minds in interviews or fits of passion or pique on team radios. Its all served up with the awesome immersiveness of modern TV. And now were in the middle of it in Monzas Temple of Speed. Its so loud Sam grins despite wearing ear plugs and overear headphones. Through it all fans mingle with hardly any agro and punters range from hardcore fans on the embankments or even climbing trees to VIP guests paying thousands for pitlane access and paddock tours.

Saturdays qualifying run is a highlight. Our seats are on the Laterale Parabolica a famous corner amidst waves of Ferrari red interspersed with the Orange Army of Dutch Verstappen fans. In the dying moments of the session Leclerc posts a scorching lap time that puts him on provisional pole. The crowd erupts. When Verstappen fails to nail a faster lap the cheers are even louder. The track is 5.79km long so we only get to see a sliver of the realtime action but big screens relay whats happening elsewhere. Its a super sporting spectacle. Im not surprised to learn sports travel packages are on the rise. Cassidy Travel with whom we travelled has already released its F1 packages for 2023 spokesperson John Spollen says they are popular as Christmas gifts and not just for petrol heads anymore. But anyone considering a Grand Prix trip needs to think about travel times the costs of food drink and transport in different destinations and factors like how familyfriendly different track layouts are what kind of walking and transfers are involved and the views your money buys in grandstands or general admission. Street circuits offer different experiences to parkland tracks for example. Venues range from Singapore to Silverstone Melbourne to Monaco. Unfortunately the experience outside of Monzas track and stands is disappointing. There are long frustrating queues for portaloos water stations and food and drink stalls. A terribly executed token system leaves us queuing for 75 minutes to buy tokens and then starting again in another line to spend them on overpriced food and water. Theres no cash cards or contactless payments no queue management and uncomfortable scrums of people at entrances exits and walkways at peak times. All of this takes place under a hot sun with the added stress of a chaotic Milan train station and odd autodromo rules  such as only being allowed to bring 500ml water bottles without caps into the festival site or having to scan tickets to exit as well as enter stands. Staff are patient but Im amazed more fans dont freak out. It definitely mars the Monza magic for us and makes the overall experience a bit... well chequered. You are not the first person to report these inconveniences to us and we regret it Federico Martegani of Monzas communications office tells me when I email afterwards. The token system was designed to reduce queues he says but we did not calculate the huge number of people on the weekend 330000 people between Friday and Sunday... an absolute record for us. We apologise for the inconvenience and this problem will certainly serve as a lesson for us to change our approach for next year. I hope so. At any rate none of this reflects on our travel agent or the ontrack action  its on the event organisers. Sam and I end the days dusty sweaty and exhausted with more than 18000 steps on my phones counter. Expand Close Entering the festival atmosphere... Photo Pl  Conghaile  Facebook Twitter Email Whatsapp Entering the festival atmosphere... Photo Pl  Conghaile But we are also elated. And when Sundays Grand Prix starts the frustration quickly fades away. We bring ice cream and sweets. There are DJs and jet flybys leaving smoke trails in green red and white. Shortly before the race drivers are paraded around in vintage openbacked cars  so close we can see their faces. The Rolex clock ticks down and the crowds cheer everything  even the guy sweeping the track who starts to move his brush in time with their roars. The anticipation is electric. When the red lights go out the grid roars into action. The first time the field passes us bunched up and competing for track position at insane speeds it comes with an exhilarating storm of noise stink of rubber and slipstream of wind think of that feeling when a train passes at full pelt on a platform. Beforehand I wondered if the reallife race could match the TV coverage. But we can see screens showing pit stops overtakes and replays hear commentary bouncing between Italian and English and relate the cars flying by to the bigger picture giving us what amounts to the best of both worlds. In that moment being trackside is thrilling. It feels like Sam and I have traced a full circle from our days watching crowdless Covidera sport in isolation to being part of the great Grand Prix circus. We are inside a sport that gave us a new bond when the world shut its engines off. In the end Ferraris drivers are beaten with Verstappen taking the chequered flag on his way to a second World Championship. The tifosi are not impressed. But soon champagne will spray and fans of all hues will spill onto this historic track. After that the travelling bank will pack up and move to the next race in Singapore. I bet they can already feel the F1 cars coming.

For more information on its F1 travel packages for 2023 see below or visit cassidytravel.iesportsbreaks. Spa Belgium Fournight packages with Grandstand Speed Corner tickets and a threestar hotel stay from 499pp flights extra. The Belgian Grand Prix runs from July 2730. Monza Italy The 2023 Italian Grand Prix runs from August 31 to September 3 next year. Fournight packages including flights a fourstar hotel stay and seated tickets from 675pp. Barcelona Spain A fivenight package with general admission tickets hotel accommodation and return flights starts from 999pp. The Spanish Grand Prix runs from June 14. Should I get general admission or grandstand tickets General admission is usually the cheapest ticket but its all relative  F1 is a pricey sport and tickets are typically for three days. These will allow access to general areas often at track height or raised ground around it with no fixed seats. You will need to arrive early for the best spots especially for qualifying and the Grand Prix itself and remember that the spots are not guaranteed  if you need to go to the loo for example. Grandstands are priced according to the views they offer and the chance of seeing some action  overtakes braking zones chicanes and so on. The priciest are usually opposite the pit lanes and starting grid where you will see the start of the race and the chequered flag. Hospitality tickets offering VIP access can cost many multiples of the price  running to thousands of euro. Seated tickets mean you can come and go from your spot. Its a good idea to try for an elevated view too  this can allow you to see the cars coming earlier and track them for longer. But it will depend on particular circuits the surrounding trees or buildings and so on. What to Pack for a Grand Prix Tracks differ widely in terms of layout locations facilities and weather. Research yours and its prohibited items carefully before compiling your packing list. Inevitably a lot of walking will be involved tracks can be several kilometres long. Wear comfy shoes and loose clothes. You may also need a hat shades sunscreen and a small umbrella for the sunrain as well as a few energy bars and water. A poncho or light rainjacket is handy too. Remember you will have to carry what you bring for the day so check the track rules as to what size bags are allowed and for any specific restrictions  such as the size of water bottles or sunscreen containers and whether phone battery packs or items like tripods are allowed. Ear defenders and ear plugs are a good idea especially for young fans. These can be bought around the track but will cost considerably less outside of it. Its better to have them and find you dont always need them than to regret not having them. A small pair of binoculars can be handy but the cars move so fast it can be hard to track them. A lanyard and pouch is useful to keep tickets and QR codes visible as they need to be scanned regularly to access stands  also to keep them safe. At the track Get a programme and figure out what action you want to see  the Formula 1 highlights of course but it will also include F2 races vintage parades and a surprising number of undercard races. Generally speaking concession stalls for food drink and merch are less busy during the popular track action or outside of peak times like lunch. You may also find cheaper food drink and souvenirs though not official merch outside of the festival boundaries. Be mindful of things like your phone battery and have a safety plan for kids in case you get separated. After the chequered flag some circuits allow fans onto the track for the champagne celebrations  research where this access will be and have a think about your exit and whether the crowds will be safe for families before committing. But most of all have fun More information For more on F1 see formula1.com. See also f1destinations.com and f1experiences.com.

On 40 acres of land on the northeast corner of Harmon Avenue and Koval Lane F1 will construct a 300000squarefoot fourstory paddock building which will serve as the hub of activity during the 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix. Its hard to make a statement in Vegas because everything is so big said Greg Maffei CEO of Liberty Media the ownership group of Formula One. This paddock building will be a sign of our longterm commitment to the Vegas community. It will serve as a yearround attraction to our fans and will be one of our most spectacular facilities. Between the land purchase and building construction F1 will have invested 500 million in Las Vegas before a race even occurs according to Gov. Steve Sisolak.

They told me between the land and what theyre building that theyre putting here thats a half a billion dollars right here. On top of everything else theyre building. All the stands on the Strip all the other things that theyre putting together. The economic impact this is going to make in the economy in Las Vegas is going to be astronomical. The Las Vegas Grand Prix isnt just a onetime thing the race is signed to occur at least three times starting next year. But hope is to make the race the marquee one on F1s schedule for the foreseeable future. The intention is for this to be a permanent event said Steve Hill president and CEO of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. Its going to be spectacular. We want it every year and they want to be here. F1 officials plan to use the paddock site for other events outside of nonrace weekends getting their monies worth from the eyepopping facility. This is a true investment in Clark County in the community said Clark County Commissioner Michael Naft. This will be a permanent facility. Yes it will be used for the worlds greatest events for Formula One events. But it will also be here yearround employing people putting people to work. And also boosting our economy and giving us one more thing to be proud of. Formula One CEO Stefano Domenicali said the paddock building cements Formula Ones commitment to the city. We want to stay for a long time Domenicali said. Its with great excitement that were there to celebrate this moment that is just the beginning.  This will be the F1 statement in Las Vegas. We know when you come here you need to be big. When tickets went on sale and some resorts room schedules were opened up this week the price shock caught some people by surprise.

Room rates began around 700 per night but were well over 1000 per night for locations along the race route. While the costs are high the race will draw droves of people from all over the world who will gladly pay the heightened fees Sisolak said. People are willing to pay from all over the world to come see it he said. People are going to be staying all over town here. Every hotel has got increased room prices by 300400 percent. Its not that theyre gouging people theyve got an investment in this as well. The skyhigh hotel prices speak to the international draw a segment that is still slowly returning to Las Vegas postpandemic Naft said. People from all over the world have been watching for those rates become available and bookings open up Naft said. It also speaks to the incredible impact this is going to have on our economy. Those room rates also translate to hotel tax revenue sales tax revenue and those are the dollars that literally help boost the economy for people like me and family who live here. The people who will be in the stands around the Strip and surrounding area next year arent the only ones who will be excited.

Formula 1’s Toto Wolff accused of running his team remotely leans into software even more, https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/04/formula-1s-toto-wolff-looks-for-fresh-edge-in-2023-through-remote-software/, We really try to go through a system like we have at Formula 1 like a team. In fact Wolff said the team has cut its emissions by nearly 90 in recent years. Surely for a company promising great efficiency to its customers theres nothing like having a revered Formula 1 team boss sing your praises. Earlier this year reports Knight Horner referred to Wolff who lives in Monaco as a tax exile who  he added disparagingly  runs his team remotely. Wolff in conversation with Knight said of Horner in turn Hes just so simple., Toto Wolff the 50yearold Austrian chief executive team principal and partowner of the Mercedes Formula 1 team who was recently described by The New Yorker as someone who might breeze past you in the airport smelling good wearing loafers and no socks talked openly yesterday about his teams terrible nogood year. Sitting with Oliver Steil the CEO of the German company TeamViewer a popular maker of remote support software Wolff also described how the troubled racing team is counting in part on TeamViewers tech to give it an edge in its bid to recapture its former glory. The two were speaking at the Web Summit conference in Lisbon and Wolff was cheered when he appeared before the crowd owing in no small part to Drive to Survive the Netflix series that has made him famous. He finds this amusing recounting to New Yorker writer Sam Knight how a young woman threw herself through the open window of his car to get her picture taken. Wolff immediately acknowledged the obvious as he settled in. We won the championship eight times in a row he said but that is the past. Mercedes he continued just got the physics wrong . . . and got the concept of the car not in the right place he said referring to the design of its floor which he has previously pointed to as the root of the teams lackluster year. Every few years the F1 teams  there are currently 10 altogether  are forced by the body overseeing Grand Prix racing to redesign their cars. Indeed its largely because it takes a long time to unwind things that are built into the car said Wolff that his team last year turned to TeamViewer a 17yearold publicly traded company whose software can remotely access and connect any computer tablet laptop mobile device or IoT endpoint like an industrial machine  or race car  to allow the remote control management and monitoring of these devices. Its a match made in heaven suggested Steil who said that TeamViewer is working closely with the MercedesAMG Petronas team to make it more efficient including running lab tests out of hours and supporting the trackside crew via remote engineers. We really try to go through a system like we have at Formula 1 like a team. We see the different parts and we see what can we do differently if we connect in real time in addition to what we do maybe on trackside and in the back office. Were really working through the different parts of the organization on testing obviously production maintenance wind tunnel all these kinds of applications where we try to see where can be better . . . Wolff chimed in separately to paint the bigger picture. We are racing 23 times around the world around the globe during the racing season and our core team is just 90 engineers with 2000 back at the factory including 1000 people focused on the chassis side and another 1000 focused on the engine. Operating in the field or we call it surgery in the field Wolff said is not always trivial because if you open up an engine or a complicated cooling system you want to have the resource from back at home and TeamViewer is the only technology that allows us today in having the guy back at home look through the same borescope into the cylinder head then help the mechanic on the field. As an added and not inconsequential benefit said both men the partnership cuts down on emissions because it means moving fewer people around at a time when Mercedes is focusing increasingly on sustainability. In fact Wolff said the team has cut its emissions by nearly 90 in recent years. It is our responsibility to show our global audience of billions of spectators that if we can do it everyone can do it he said. Certainly the appearance was a great moment for TeamViewer whose other clients range from telecommunications companies to the fastfood franchise Wendys. Surely for a company promising great efficiency to its customers theres nothing like having a revered Formula 1 team boss sing your praises. Of course what racing fans want to know is whether the tech will give Mercedes  which has yet to win a race in 2022  enough of an edge to overcome the teams archrivals Red Bull and Ferrari. While Wolff is looking to tomorrow as he said yesterday it could take a while even with the faster feedback loops that TeamViewers technology provides the team. As he recently told the outlet RacingNews365 Mercedes is still eight to 10 months behind Red Bull in terms of Formula 1 development after its frustrating 2022 season. There is definitely a challenge he added but we are playing the long game all of us. The intense rivalry between the two teams though perfect for television remains very real in the meantime. As The New Yorker piece observes of the 10 team principals in the sport only Wolff and Christian Horner who runs the Red Bull team have ever won a world championship and they appear to truly loathe one another. Earlier this year reports Knight Horner referred to Wolff who lives in Monaco as a tax exile who  he added disparagingly  runs his team remotely. Wolff in conversation with Knight said of Horner in turn Hes just so simple.

Formula 1 teams are looking at introducing new winter shutdown for staff wellbeing, https://www.planetf1.com/news/formula-1-winter-shutdown-proposal/, A winter break comprising a total shutdown of factory operations could be introduced into Formula 1. The sport already has a summer shutdown during the August holiday when development work must stop and similar could follow around the Christmas and New Year period. Although team staff inevitably will have some time off over the festive period there is nothing as yet mandated in the F1 regulations. But for the race team thats clocking many airline miles thats a positive.Winter shutdown can only be a good moveIf it works in the summer there is no reason why it shouldnt do so in the winter also. Taking away that dilemma appears to be something of a nobrainer as the Formula 1 schedule  and the increasing demands that go with it  takes on recordbreaking proportions., A winter break comprising a total shutdown of factory operations could be introduced into Formula 1. The sport already has a summer shutdown during the August holiday when development work must stop and similar could follow around the Christmas and New Year period. It would be a measure to try and offset the effects of the expanding race calendar which is up to a record 24 grands prix in 2023. Although team staff inevitably will have some time off over the festive period there is nothing as yet mandated in the F1 regulations. Motorsport.com are reporting such a proposal intended to start from December 2023 has been made at a meeting of the Sporting Advisory Committee but is still some way from being finalised. Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff is in favour having been quoted as saying Many of us team principals would like to replicate what we have in the summer at least starting at Christmas and going into the new year for two weeks. Obviously thats still up for discussion. But there was a positive indication for the wellbeing of the people. At least in 202223 there will be a longer break between seasons as the final race of this year the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix takes place on November 20 to avoid more than one days overlap with the football World Cup which begins that day. And whereas in 202122 there was less than 11 weeks between the end of one campaign and the start of unofficial testing for the next that will increase to just under 14 as preseason running in Bahrain begins on February 23. Its great that the season finishes this couple of weeks earlier than in the past because everyone is really at the limit added Wolff. Having this two weeks more is definitely a nice welcome but on the other side there are many people in the factory who will work flat out between Christmas and New Year. But for the race team thats clocking many airline miles thats a positive. Winter shutdown can only be a good move If it works in the summer there is no reason why it shouldnt do so in the winter also. For any team that doubted whether they could afford to ease down over the festive period and allow staff to spend time with their families it would remove the need for any difficult decisions. The fear would obviously have been conceding a competitive advantage. A bit like when decathlete Daley Thompson and darts legend Phil Taylor used to train and practice respectively on Christmas Day because they expected their rivals would not be. Taking away that dilemma appears to be something of a nobrainer as the Formula 1 schedule  and the increasing demands that go with it  takes on recordbreaking proportions.

But if ticket prices stay like this or rise further we will get the days of Bernie back. This article was written by Ludo van Denderen and originally published on the Dutch edition of GPblogRead more Heineken title sponsor of Las Vegas Grand Prix in 2023, It was the time when Dutch driver Christijan Albers was racing in Formula 1 that my colleague asked the chief sports editor of the Algemeen Dagblad in the Netherlands Why dont we go to those Grands Prix Theres a Dutchman competing The chief barely looked up from behind his computer. Formula One No there is no interest in that. Were not doing it. Article continues under ad These days the newspaper travels all over the world to report on Max Verstappen. Preferably as many reports as possible are written because Algemeen Dagblad knows they are read en masse. As all over the world coverage of the premier motorsport class has increased in recent years. Even in the United States the country that never seemed to care about Formula 1. Quality Of course it is great to see how popular F1 is at the moment. To a large extent this is thanks to the efforts of Liberty Media. Since the US company took over the rights from Bernie Ecclestone there has been a quality drive especially online to engage new generations. Formula 1 is more than just a sport it is also a show and entertainment. Americans understand that like no other. Read more Cheaper F1 tickets to attract more fans Unfortunately Formula 1 and in their wake the organisers of Grands Prix are starting to strike out which  just when things are going so well  may lead to the alienation of fans. Not only is there hardly any country that does not require a special season ticket to watch the races the prices of Grand Prix entry tickets are also taking absurd forms. Revenue To understand ticket prices it is necessary to understand how Formula 1 generates revenue. The organiser of a Grand Prix pays Liberty Media up to around 40 million to host a race. With increasing demand from countries and cities to have a Grand Prix Libertys adage is If you dont want to pay that well go elsewhere. So organisers are pulling out the purse strings. Little choice. Article continues under ad Somewhere organisers have to recoup this money. With ticket sales in other words. Knowing that many people want to attend a Grand Prix they think they can even make a profit. The fans will pay anyway. Indeed they do. For a threeday ticket on a windy grandstand at the hardtoreach SpaFrancorchamps 500 to over 600 euros is easily paid. Or take Monza which has tripled prices over the past three years. The Italians come anyway. Absurd The absolute low point now is Las Vegas. Surely its insane that you have to pay 2000 to see Formula One cars go by for a few seconds a lap Think about it for a moment. 2000. That could be a months salary. If you want to go as a couple with two children 8000. And that doesnt include a hotel. Just four seats. Indeed up to this point fans lay down hundreds if not thousands of euros or dollars to attend a race. With rising inflation and more and more people in money worries the question is how long Formula 1 was once under Bernie the plaything of the elite. It was precisely that image that the sport was slowly losing. Formula 1 is now synonymous with a peoples party. For everyone. But if ticket prices stay like this or rise further we will get the days of Bernie back. Then Formula 1 will be back to what it once was for the happy few.

Wolff: Reputation damage from breaking F1 cost cap enough of a deterrent, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/wolff-reputation-damage-from-breaking-f1-cost-cap-enough-of-a-deterrent/10394949/, Red Bulls breach of the cost cap limit in 2021 triggered a major controversy within F1 recently with opinions divided in the paddock about how extreme the sanctions taken again it should be. And reflecting on his stance Wolff said the main thing that would turn teams off from risking even minor breaches was the bad publicity such a move brings. Beyond the sporting penalty and the financial penalty which obviously resonates in the real world out there there is a big reputational consequence said Wolff. Were getting kids that are being bullied in playgrounds that are employees children that is not right through fictitious allegations from other teams. It was a first strong governance strong policing independent assessment., Red Bulls breach of the cost cap limit in 2021 triggered a major controversy within F1 recently with opinions divided in the paddock about how extreme the sanctions taken again it should be. In the end the Milton Keynesbased outfit was handed a 7 million fine and had its aero development allowance cut back by 10 because it overspent by around 1.8 million last year. Wolff was quite calm about the penalty the FIA settled on admitting in Mexico that while Mercedes felt it was too little equally he accepted Red Bull probably felt it was too harsh. And reflecting on his stance Wolff said the main thing that would turn teams off from risking even minor breaches was the bad publicity such a move brings. Beyond the sporting penalty and the financial penalty which obviously resonates in the real world out there there is a big reputational consequence said Wolff. And that is why I believe no team is going to put a foot wrong over the line because you dont want to have your partners and your team dragged into this space. Were living in a transparent compliant world. Everything needs governance and the sport needs it. As a sport overall this is the real achievement of the whole process. Toto Wolff Team Principal and CEO Mercedes AMG Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images Red Bull has found itself on the receiving end of some extreme media criticisms in recent weeks and its team principal Christian Horner has not been happy about the strains the cost cap case has put on staff  especially when words like cheating have been bandied about. Weve been on trial because of public accusations since Singapore said Horner recently. The numbers have been put out in the media that are miles out of reality. And the damage that does to the brand to our partners to our drivers to our workforce in an age where mental health is prevalent were seeing significant issues within our workforce. Were getting kids that are being bullied in playgrounds that are employees children that is not right through fictitious allegations from other teams. You cannot go around just making that kind of allegation without any fact or substance. We absolutely are appalled at the behaviour of some of our competitors. Asked why Mercedes had been so calm about Red Bulls final penalty despite initial anger when it emerged the rule breach had taken place Wolff said Im beyond the point now that I want to comment on what is being said there. So for me the most important outcome of this whole process is there is a penalty whether its too small right or too big  difficult to judge. It was a first strong governance strong policing independent assessment. And then a fine. That wouldnt have been the case in the past I guess.

McLaren star's new attitude towards his F1 dream, https://the-race.com/formula-1/mclaren-stars-new-attitude-towards-his-f1-dream/, In little more than a year Pato OWard went from Red Bull F1 junior programme reject  in ridiculous fashion  to IndyCar star and future F1 tester with McLaren. The fact hes being trusted with 10 million Ayrton Senna McLaren F1 cars reflects the regard he is held in at McLaren but his approach to driving that car perhaps reflects a new or modified attitude OWard has towards his chances of making it to F1. Asked by The Race about how hes balancing his IndyCar career with keeping his foot in the door with F1 OWard says Step by step I guess Yeah step by step. But its also very important to enjoy where youre at enjoy the moment enjoy the present and maximise it., In little more than a year Pato OWard went from Red Bull F1 junior programme reject  in ridiculous fashion  to IndyCar star and future F1 tester with McLaren. The fact hes being trusted with 10 million Ayrton Senna McLaren F1 cars reflects the regard he is held in at McLaren but his approach to driving that car perhaps reflects a new or modified attitude OWard has towards his chances of making it to F1. Why driving Sennas M c Laren left OWard feeling mad Read more When he won the Texas IndyCar race in 2021 as part of a bet with Zak Brown he would get to test McLaren machinery in Abu Dhabi at the end of the year. It completed a whirlwind turnaround in fortune for the driver who was promised so much in the past but dare he dream this time it would be a reality Complications around the end of last year and the beginning of this one surrounding OWards future contract put a damper on a test where he probably wasnt physically prepared enough for F1  see comments about his neck being destroyed  and hed probably admit now he allowed himself to get caught up in the narrative that an F1 future was possible before it was realistic. Asked by The Race about how hes balancing his IndyCar career with keeping his foot in the door with F1 OWard says Step by step I guess Yeah step by step. And its important not to get too ahead of yourself. And its hard not to  very hard not to. But its also very important to enjoy where youre at enjoy the moment enjoy the present and maximise it. And I feel like with doing so doors will open and things will align. If I keep doing my job properly and keep performing. OWards contract dispute with McLaren turned messy and clouded the first part of the year until things began to turn around in April and at the Long Beach race in IndyCar OWard used a hotel room discussion with his cousin to establish a new attitude which can be over simplified for explanation purposes as you can only focus on what you can control everything else is out of your hands and will fall into place. Targeting a proper offseason and spending time with his family is a top priority for OWard as he felt like the business of last years post IndyCar season activities left him jaded by the time the season came around in February alongside his contract dispute that dragged on. It just sucked  M c Laren contract sagas effect on OWard Read more With a new contract in May he found a new level and only reliability issues halted a title campaign that featured him qualifying in IndyCars Fast Six on every single road course this year. Sorting his contract focusing on things he could control and ensuring time for himself away from the track all helped construct this new mentality or at least approach. Now OWard faces the complication of 2021 IndyCar champion Alex Palou coming into the fold and testing at McLaren as the pair shared F1 tests in Barcelona and Austria last month with Palou taking the first FP1 opportunity and running less than three tenths off Lando Norris on comparable tyres at COTA. Palou wasnt allowed to shine in FP1  but he still impressed Read more But OWards revised attitude  plus what appears to be the inherent belief he can take on and beat Palou on a level playing field  means F1 opportunities are a bonus as opposed to a key part of his immediate goals. After Im done with the FP1 Ill be able to relate a little bit more what it feels like but Im just so grateful for the opportunity adds OWard. And I want to be a sponge just absorb everything that Im learning and continue to learn. And just keep improving  help the team and just never forget to enjoy it because thats the most important thing. Enjoying it is a phrase that can certainly be used to describe OWards opinion of driving the Senna McLaren MP45B at Laguna Seca last month. Even if that came with pressure  Brown made sure OWard knew the cars 10 million value just as he was getting in the car to take it for a spin  the enjoyment and carefree attitude OWard approached the historic test in is the perfect metaphor for the new mental space hes approaching his contemporary F1 opportunities with.

The value of the 10 teams currently in F1 has risen steeply since Liberty Media acquired the championship ahead of the 2017 season. Despite appearing to warm to the idea of an 11th team Domenicali warned again that it cannot come at a price to existing teams. This is what is written in the Concorde Agreement but mainly the point is that does a new entry bring a better position for the F1 world championship This is really in terms of value from a financial point of view and in terms of value from a sporting point of view., Sam Hall Friday 4 November 2022 1514  Updated 1518 F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali has claimed the sport is finally ready to entertain credible proposals to increase the grid to 11 teams. The value of the 10 teams currently in F1 has risen steeply since Liberty Media acquired the championship ahead of the 2017 season. This value was protected in the latest Concorde Agreement by the addition of a 200million antidilution fee that would be split between the existing teams upon the arrival of a new entry. Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff has been vocal in his opposition to any new team unless it can benefit the entire paddock and although echoing these comments Domenicali has hinted at a change in the position now from F1. It is not a problem having one more team to have better racing therefore we will see and we will monitor the situation said Domenicali in an investors call following the release of Liberty Medias thirdquarter financial results. READ MORE...F1 enjoys another revenue bump as recovery continues If there would be a real credible new entry that wants to discuss with us we are ready to discuss but we are not in a rushed position today for that. Franchise dilution cannot be allowed Michael Andretti has been battling to position his successful outfit in the sport and recently told GPFans that F1 would be our life. Despite appearing to warm to the idea of an 11th team Domenicali warned again that it cannot come at a price to existing teams. With regard to the value or the process of the possibility of bringing a new F1 team into the championship of course there is the primary step that both us and the FIA have to be in agreement on that he added. And I think the first thing that we need to consider is will this eventual possibility bring extra value to the championship If so of course we are going to discuss it internally and we will see if there is any kind of real potential for a new entry that can give value to the championship. On top of this there is a value that has to be recognised to the teams that are already in the championship because of course they cannot allow any dilution of their partnership with the F1 championship. This is what is written in the Concorde Agreement but mainly the point is that does a new entry bring a better position for the F1 world championship This is really in terms of value from a financial point of view and in terms of value from a sporting point of view.
F1 reports increase in quarterly revenue in COVID-19 recovery, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/f1-reports-increase-in-quarterly-revenue-as-covid-recovery-complete/10394982/, Overall F1 revenue rose from 668m in 2021 to 715m in 2022 for JulySeptember although operating income was only up from 80m to 82m thanks to increased costs. Primary F1 revenue increased in the third quarter with growth across media rights and sponsorship partially offset by a decline in race promotion revenue. Media rights increased due to growth in F1 TV subscription revenue and increased fees under new and renewed contractual agreements and sponsorship revenue increased due to the recognition of revenue from new sponsors. In addition other cost of F1 revenue grew due to higher commissions and partner servicing costs associated with the primary F1 revenue streams and higher Formula 2 and Formula 3 related costs. Selling general and administrative expense increased in the third quarter due to higher personnel and IT costs and increased legal and other advisory fees., However the change was not as dramatic as in previous quarters because income in the latter part of 2021 was not impacted as dramatically by the pandemic as last year race attendances began to return to normal levels and the lucrative Paddock Club got back up to speed. Overall F1 revenue rose from 668m in 2021 to 715m in 2022 for JulySeptember although operating income was only up from 80m to 82m thanks to increased costs. The 10 F1 teams shared payments of 370m up from 338m in 2021. The JulySeptember periods of 2021 and 2022 provide for a fairly accurate comparison as both featured seven races. Six events were the same across both seasons while the major difference was that the first year featured the more lucrative Russian GP whereas France fell into the same period in 2022. Because of that change race promotion income was actually slightly down but that was offset by increases in broadcast and sponsorship revenue. Explaining the figures F1 noted F1s results in 2022 are not being impacted by capacity limitations and throughout the first nine months of the 2022 season F1 has seen strong growth in attendance in the grandstands and the Paddock Club. Primary F1 revenue increased in the third quarter with growth across media rights and sponsorship partially offset by a decline in race promotion revenue. The F1 logo Photo by Drew Gibson  Motorsport Images Race promotion revenue decreased due to lower fees generated from the different mix of events held with one additional race held outside of Europe in the prior year period. Media rights increased due to growth in F1 TV subscription revenue and increased fees under new and renewed contractual agreements and sponsorship revenue increased due to the recognition of revenue from new sponsors. Other F1 revenue increased in the third quarter primarily due to higher hospitality revenue generated from the Paddock Club which operated at one additional race in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the prior year period and has seen record attendance yeartodate. Explaining the overall rise in costs relative to 2021 F1 said These costs increased in the third quarter driven by the costs of higher hospitality attendance in the Paddock Club and one additional Paddock Club event operated compared to the prior year period.

I think my future will be I dont think its relative to what others do., Daniel Ricciardo has brushed off suggestions that a fresh deal for Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes could make returning to the F1 grid in 2024 more difficult as he prepares to embark on a year out of the sport. Ricciardo will be replaced by fellow Australian Oscar Piastri at McLaren next season and with Haas holding the one remaining vacancy on the 2023 grid the 33yearold recently admitted that its almost certain he wont be competing. READ MORE I wish it was like this more often  Ricciardo delighted with P7 finish as he explains Tsunoda crash One role Ricciardo remains open to is that of a reserve driver before working his way back into a race seat for the 2024 campaign with his name recently being linked to Mercedes  who need to replace AlphaTauribound Nyck de Vries. However a promotion from reserve duties to a race seat at the Silver Arrows appears unlikely at least in the near future with George Russell tied down on a longterm deal and team mate Hamilton confirming over the Mexico City Grand Prix weekend that he intends to sign a new contract. Ricciardo is set for a season out of the sport after a challenging twoyear spell at McLaren As the wait goes on to discover where Ricciardo will end up he made clear that his future ambitions are not pinned on the decisions of other drivers while expressing hope that Hamilton will continue for many years to come. The truth is I want him to stay in the sport. Hes one of the greatest ever to do it and I think competing with him going wheel to wheel with him is fun its awesome. Its normally at the pointy end so I certainly wish to do that more in the future said Ricciardo.

I think its how do I say it like opportunities will arise when they do but Im not banking on anyone doing something so I can find my way. Asked by Sky Sports F1 about the prospect of Ricciardo joining Mercedes in a reserve role Russell said Yeah I think thatd be interesting. I think wed like to see that. But its up to Daniel to see what he wants to do with his future. Ricciardo enjoyed plenty of ontrack battles with Hamilton during his time at Red Bull

Primary F1 revenue represents the majority of F1s revenue and is derived from i race promotion revenue ii media rights fees and iii sponsorship fees. There were seven races held in the third quarters of both 2022 and 2021. There are 22 events scheduled for the 2022 race calendar. Throughout 2021 and particularly in the first half of the season attendance at races was limited due to the pandemic. Restrictions on fan attendance reduced as 2021 progressed with all races in the second half of the year operating at either full capacity or with fewer restrictions. The Paddock Club resumed normal operations beginning with the Austrian Grand Prix on July 4 2021. F1s results in 2022 are not being impacted by capacity limitations and throughout the first nine months of the 2022 season F1 has seen strong growth in attendance in the grandstands and the Paddock Club. Primary F1 revenue increased in the third quarter with growth across media rights and sponsorship partially offset by a decline in race promotion revenue. Race promotion revenue decreased due to lower fees generated from the different mix of events held with one additional race held outside of Europe in the prior year period. Media rights increased due to growth in F1 TV subscription revenue and increased fees under new and renewed contractual agreements and sponsorship revenue increased due to the recognition of revenue from new sponsors. Other F1 revenue increased in the third quarter primarily due to higher hospitality revenue generated from the Paddock Club which operated at one additional race in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the prior year period and has seen record attendance yeartodate. Operating income was flat and adjusted OIBDA2 decreased in the third quarter. Cost of F1 revenue increased compared to the prior year due to the pro rata recognition of increased team payments. Other cost of F1 revenue is largely variable in nature and mostly relates to revenue opportunities. These costs increased in the third quarter driven by the costs of higher hospitality attendance in the Paddock Club and one additional Paddock Club event operated compared to the prior year period. In addition other cost of F1 revenue grew due to higher commissions and partner servicing costs associated with the Primary F1 revenue streams and higher Formula 2 and Formula 3 related costs. Selling general and administrative expense increased in the third quarter due to higher personnel and IT costs and increased legal and other advisory fees. The Liberty SiriusXM Group holds an approximate 1.8 intergroup interest 4.2 million notional shares in the Formula One Group as of October 31 2022. These shares are not included in the outstanding share count of Formula One Group in Liberty Medias most recent Form 10Q. Assuming the issuance of the shares underlying this intergroup interest the Formula One Group outstanding share count as of October 31 2022 would have been 238 million. The businesses and assets attributed to the Formula One Group consist of Liberty Medias subsidiary F1 its interest in Liberty Media Acquisition Corporation other minority investments and an intergroup interest in the Braves Group. BRAVES GROUP  The following table provides the financial results attributed to the Braves Group for the third quarter of 2022. In the third quarter approximately 5 million of corporate level selling general and administrative expense including stockbased compensation expense was allocated to the Braves Group. 3Q21 3Q22 amounts in millions Braves Group Revenue Corporate and other  234  252 Operating Income Corporate and other  30  8 Adjusted OIBDA Corporate and other  55  38 The following table provides the operating results of Braves Holdings LLC Braves. 3Q21 3Q22  Change amounts in millions Baseball revenue  222  238 7  Development revenue 12 14 17  Total revenue 234 252 8  Operating expenses excluding stockbased compensation included below Other operating expenses 153 184 20  Selling general and administrative expenses 23 27 17  Adjusted OIBDA  58  41 29  Impairment restructuring and acquisition costs net of recoveries  5 NM Stockbased compensation 2 2   Depreciation and Amortization 21 21   Operating income  35  13 63  Number of home games in period 34 38 Baseball revenue is derived from two primary sources i ballpark event revenue ticket sales concessions advertising sponsorships suites and premium seat fees and ii broadcasting revenue including national and local broadcast rights. Development revenue is derived from the Battery Atlanta mixeduse facilities and primarily includes rental income. There were 38 home games played in the third quarter of 2022 compared to 34 games played in the prior year period. A full 162 game schedule was played in 2022. Baseball revenue increased in the third quarter due to more home games played and increased ticket demand at regular season games as well as additional special events including concerts held at the ballpark compared to the period year period. Development revenue increased during the third quarter due to a reduction in deferred payment arrangements and increases in rental income from various new lease commencements. Operating income and adjusted OIBDA decreased in the third quarter. Increased operating costs due to higher player salaries higher levels of facility and game day expenses driven by more home games and higher attendance and increased expenses under MLBs revenue sharing plan more than offset revenue growth. Selling general and administrative expense increased primarily due to increased special event expenses marketing initiatives and personnel costs. The Formula One Group holds an approximate 11.1 intergroup interest 6.8 million notional shares and the Liberty SiriusXM Group holds an approximate 2.9 intergroup interest 1.8 million notional shares in the Braves Group as of October 31 2022. These shares are not included in the outstanding share count of the Braves Group in Liberty Medias most recent Form 10Q. Assuming the issuance of the shares underlying these intergroup interests the Braves Group outstanding share count as of October 31 2022 would have been 61 million.

regarding our financial results this press release includes a presentation of Adjusted OIBDA which is a nonGAAP financial measure for the Liberty SiriusXM Group the Braves Group and the Formula One Group together with reconciliations to operating income as determined under GAAP. Liberty Media defines Adjusted OIBDA as operating income loss plus depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation separately reported litigation settlements restructuring acquisition and other related costs and impairment charges. Liberty Media believes Adjusted OIBDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its businesses by identifying those items that are not directly a reflection of each business performance or indicative of ongoing business trends. In addition this measure allows management to view operating results and perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. Because Adjusted OIBDA is used as a measure of operating performance Liberty Media views operating income as the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Adjusted OIBDA is not meant to replace or supersede operating income or any other GAAP measure but rather to supplement such GAAP measures in order to present investors with the same information that Liberty Medias management considers in assessing the results of operations and performance of its assets. The following table provides a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA for Liberty Media to operating income calculated in accordance with GAAP for the three months ended September 30 2021 and September 30 2022 respectively. QUARTERLY SUMMARY amounts in millions 3Q21 3Q22 Liberty SiriusXM Group Operating Income  604  434 Depreciation and amortization 152 157 Stock compensation expense 54 53 Impairment restructuring and acquisition costs net of recoveriesa 95  69 Adjusted OIBDA  715  713 Formula One Group Operating Income  68  64 Depreciation and amortization 100 89 Stock compensation expense 8 5 Adjusted OIBDA  176  158 Braves Group Operating Income  30  8 Depreciation and amortization 22 22 Stock compensation expense 3 3 Impairment restructuring and acquisition costs net of recoveriesa  5 Adjusted OIBDA  55  38 Liberty Media Corporation Consolidated Operating Income  702  506 Depreciation and amortization 274 268 Stock compensation expense 65 61 Impairment restructuring and acquisition costs net of recoveriesa 95  74 Adjusted OIBDA  946  909  a During the three months ended September 30 2021 SiriusXM recorded insurance recoveries related to the SXM7 satellite of 80 million as well as the reversal of a 17 million liability related to the Stitcher acquisition. During the three months ended September 30 2022 Sirius XM recorded impairment losses of 43 million related to the termination of certain software projects 20 million related to the impairment of vacated office spaces and 5 million related to personnel severance and Braves Holdings recorded 5 million of impairment losses as a result of hurricane damage at its spring training facility in Florida. These charges have been excluded from adjusted OIBDA. SCHEDULE 2 This press release also includes a presentation of adjusted EBITDA of SiriusXM which is a nonGAAP financial measure used by SiriusXM together with a reconciliation to SiriusXMs standalone net income as determined under GAAP. SiriusXM defines adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense income tax expense and depreciation and amortization. SiriusXM adjusts EBITDA to exclude the impact of other expense income as well as certain other charges discussed below. Adjusted EBITDA is a NonGAAP financial measure that excludes or adjusts for if applicable i loss on extinguishment of debt ii sharebased payment expense iii impairment restructuring and acquisition costs iv legal settlementsreserves and v other significant operating expense income that do not relate to the ongoing performance of SiriusXMs business. SiriusXM believes adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of the underlying trend of its operating performance which provides useful information about its business apart from the costs associated with its capital structure and purchase price accounting. SiriusXM believes investors find this NonGAAP financial measure useful when analyzing past operating performance with current performance and comparing SiriusXMs operating performance to the performance of other communications entertainment and media companies. SiriusXM believes investors use adjusted EBITDA to estimate current enterprise value and to make investment decisions. As a result of large capital investments in SiriusXMs satellite radio system its results of operations reflect significant charges for depreciation expense. SiriusXM believes the exclusion of sharebased payment expense is useful as it is not directly related to the operational conditions of its business. SiriusXM also believes the exclusion of the legal settlements and reserves impairment restructuring and acquisition related costs and loss on extinguishment of debt to the extent they occur during the period is useful as they are significant expenses not incurred as part of its normal operations for the period. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact to SiriusXMs statements of comprehensive income of certain expenses including sharebased payment expense. SiriusXM endeavors to compensate for the limitations of the NonGAAP measure presented by also providing the comparable GAAP measure with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items including quantifying such items to derive the NonGAAP measure. Investors that wish to compare and evaluate operating results after giving effect for these costs should refer to net income as disclosed in SiriusXMs unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Since adjusted EBITDA is a NonGAAP financial performance measure SiriusXMs calculation of adjusted EBITDA may be susceptible to varying calculations may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered in isolation as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The reconciliation of net income to the adjusted EBITDA is calculated as follows Unaudited For the Three Months Ended September 30 2021 2022  in millions Net income  343  247 Add back items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA Impairment restructuring and acquisition costsa 95  69 Sharebased payment expense 51 50 Depreciation and amortization 135 134 Interest expense 111 107 Loss on extinguishment of debt 83  Other expense income 1 3 Income tax benefit expense 90 110 Adjusted EBITDA  719  720  a During the three months ended September 30 2021 SiriusXM recorded insurance recoveries related to the SXM7 satellite of 80 million as well as the reversal of a 17 million liability related to the Stitcher acquisition.

Alpine: F1 2022 engine performance gain worth reliability risks, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/alpine-f1-2022-engine-performance-gain-worth-reliability-risks/10394839/, In Mexico Fernando Alonso lost seventh place in the closing laps after suffering a cylinder issue that obliged him to stop. Szafnauer insists that problems have largely resulted from a general push for performance with the power unit and that they can be resolved over the winter. So we made a conscious decision to push the performance envelope and fix reliability issues as we got to them because the FIA allows that. But if you have to err on that side you push the performance boundary because you cant add performance now until 2026 you can fix reliability issues. But the short term is reliability in the next few races finish strong and I think our performance will be there., Listen to this article The team has suffered more reliability problems than most rivals costing valuable ground in the battle with McLaren for fourth in the world championship. Alpine is currently in front by just seven points. In Mexico Fernando Alonso lost seventh place in the closing laps after suffering a cylinder issue that obliged him to stop. Szafnauer insists that problems have largely resulted from a general push for performance with the power unit and that they can be resolved over the winter. We mustnt forget that at the beginning of the year we set out  and this was before I was here but I think it was the right decision on the powertrain side  to err on the side of performance he said said. Because the powertrain was going to be frozen. So we made a conscious decision to push the performance envelope and fix reliability issues as we got to them because the FIA allows that. So that was a conscious and strategic decision. And now when we face them we can fix them. We didnt do it on purpose to not be reliable. But if you have to err on that side you push the performance boundary because you cant add performance now until 2026 you can fix reliability issues. And we can do it over the winter. So strategically I think it was the right thing to do. And we still have two races left to finish in fourth. I think we can do that. Asked by Motorsport.com if it was frustrating to lose valuable points in Mexico he said Ill tell you my frustration after Abu Dhabi For sure you want to score more points. Fernando Alonso Alpine F1 Team climbs out of his car after retiring from the race Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images Szafnauer acknowledged that it doesnt matter what margin Alpine beats McLaren by as long as the team can stay in front. No not at this point. And then over the winter well make even more reliability improvements. You cant improve the performance it is what it is. And well be better off. But weve got to remember this powertrain has to last until 2026. So for sure it was the right strategy. I think were on a good trajectory. And lets see what next year brings. But the short term is reliability in the next few races finish strong and I think our performance will be there. Szafnauer says that the Renault engine division in ViryChatillon knows what it has to do having fixed other issues earlier in the season. Yeah more than I do for example he said. So I was asking them about the Mexico cylinder failure. And then although I spent seven and a half years at Honda powertrains theyve got a much deeper understanding and theyll figure it out. But like I said strategically thats what we set out to do. Every time we have an issue we fix it. It doesnt come back. So this was a little bit different than what we had in Singapore.

'Magnussen could lose his seat instead' - Schumacher on Haas' driver line-up, https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1016267/1/magnussen-could-lose-his-seat-instead-schumacher-haas-driver-lineup, Haas have yet to decide who will complete their F1 driver lineup for next season. Magnussen has a multiyear deal with the team while the second seat is between Mick Schumacher and Nico Hulkenberg. Since the Austrian Grand Prix Schumacher has often been the quicker of the two Haas drivers particularly on a Sunday. Speaking to Sky Germany Ralf said that Magnussens seat should also be under threat for next season. In the last race Mexcio Mick was sometimes up to sixtenths faster than Magnussen  so lets wait and see for the next few races., Haas have yet to decide who will complete their F1 driver lineup for next season. Magnussen has a multiyear deal with the team while the second seat is between Mick Schumacher and Nico Hulkenberg. Despite impressing on his return at the seasonopening Bahrain Grand Prix Magnussens form has dipped in the second half of the season. Since the Austrian Grand Prix Schumacher has often been the quicker of the two Haas drivers particularly on a Sunday. Speaking to Sky Germany Ralf said that Magnussens seat should also be under threat for next season. Anything is possible of course especially if we look at the last few races he said. Who knows Magnussen may not be so firmly in the seat anymore. If we look at the races since Silverstone we have to conclude that Mick is the more stable and better of the two drivers  and who has also had some bad luck with wrong strategies. In the last race Mexcio Mick was sometimes up to sixtenths faster than Magnussen  so lets wait and see for the next few races. I hope Haas make a decision soon. Maybe next year we will have two Germans on the Formula 1 grid. Recently team boss Guenther Steiner explained that its still 5050 on who will drive for the team alongside Magnussen in 2023. Im honest Its still 5050 he explained. Nothing has been decided yet he said. We will logically not make a decision between Austin and Mexico simply because time is not there. The next time would be the week after Mexico because we dont have a race then and have more time to deal with it.

Red Bull finalises Mateschitz succession plan, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/red-bull-finalises-mateschitz-succession-plan/10394847/, Listen to this articleJust a fortnight after Mateschitz passed away Red Bull has settled on how the company will be controlled going forward. In a letter that Mateschitzs son Mark sent to Red Bull staff he explained that a solution proposed by my father and supported by our Thai partners would be put in place. Before joining Red Bull Mintzlaff was a longdistance runner. Speaking recently Horner said that Mateschitz had ensured that the longterm future of Red Bulls F1 operations was secure. And with in 2026 Red Bull becoming a power unit manufacturer that was the missing piece of our jigsaw and he had the vision to enable that to happen., Listen to this article Just a fortnight after Mateschitz passed away Red Bull has settled on how the company will be controlled going forward. It has been decided that strategicoperational responsibility at Red Bull will no longer be executed by a single CEO as it did under Mateschitz and will instead be divided among three people. In a letter that Mateschitzs son Mark sent to Red Bull staff he explained that a solution proposed by my father and supported by our Thai partners would be put in place. The latter comment is a reference to the Yoovidhya family of entrepreneurs. Red Bulls business will therefore be taken care of in the future by a socalled Board of Directors consisting of Franz Watzlawick CEO Beverage Business Alexander Kirchmayr CFO and Oliver Mintzlaff CEO Corporate Projects and Investments Mateschitz Jr. added Franz Alexander and Oliver were our dream team. I am very happy that they will be taking on this task. The division of responsibility means that F1 teams Red Bull and AlphaTauri will fall under the responsibility of Mintzlaff who counts sponsorship among his new tasks and Kirchmayr from now on. With Kirchmayr being the new CFO in the Group he will likely be the one who gives the thumbsup or thumbsdown on all budgets. A Red Bull statement read Following the passing of Dietrich Mateschitz we are pleased to learn of the appointment of Oliver Mintzlaff to CEO of Corporate Projects and investments. Although there wont be any changes in the daytoday with Oracle Red Bull Racing we look forward to working closely with someone likeminded who has such a strong pedigree in elite sports. Mintzlaff is no stranger to German sports fans. Most recently he was chairman of the board of the Bundesliga soccer club RB Leipzig e. V. and managing director of RB Leipzig GmbH. Prior to that he was in charge of coordinating all of Red Bulls global soccer commitments from 2014 until Leipzigs promotion to the Bundesliga in 2016. Before joining Red Bull Mintzlaff was a longdistance runner. In 1999 he finished fifth in the German halfmarathon championships and eighth in the 10kilometre distance in 2001. Sergio Perez Red Bull Racing RB18 Photo by Steven Tee  Motorsport Images From 2000 to 2008 he worked for the sporting goods manufacturer Puma and later as a player consultant and manager among other things. It is thought unlikely that Red Bulls F1 operations will change much as a result of the new senior management structure especially with F1 team boss Christian Horner having helped lead the squad back to its first championship double since 2013. Speaking recently Horner said that Mateschitz had ensured that the longterm future of Red Bulls F1 operations was secure. The future is set said Horner when asked if any changes would follow Mateschitzs death. Hes put in place a very strong foundation for the future. And with in 2026 Red Bull becoming a power unit manufacturer that was the missing piece of our jigsaw and he had the vision to enable that to happen. And just as weve done with the chassis we will take that same spirit his spirit into the future engine company.

Why Hamilton changed his mind about racing in F1 after 40, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/why-hamilton-changed-his-mind-about-racing-in-f1-after-40/10394765/, Why is a driver who is so determined to make an impact beyond what he does ontrack keen to keep on racing Hamilton admitted in Mexico last week that he wasnt sure what had changed his mind on wanting to keep racing after being 40. Thats been a really interesting process and Im grateful to be a part of it said Hamilton. I get asked every day to do so many different things and Im able to push back and say no. I think theres more stuff to achieve together.Lewis Hamilton Mercedes AMG 2nd position with his trophy Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images, Listen to this article Hamilton has often joked that he does not want to be the oldest driver on the grid embracing the continued contract extensions for Fernando Alonso who at 41 is preparing to keep on racing for at least a few more years. More seriously Hamilton has always vowed that he would not want to keep on racing until he is totally burnt out instead wishing to bow out when he is still fresh and has the energy to focus on other projects. Mission 44 his charity dedicated to improving representation in motorsport and Ignite a charity set up with Mercedes also intended to aid diversity are two such interests that will be the focus of his postracing life ensuring he has a legacy that goes beyond his ontrack achievements. But after Hamilton revealed in a group media interview including Motorsport.com in Austin last month that he plans to sign a new multiyear contract with Mercedes it led to a fresh look at where he currently stands in F1. His existing deal expires at the end of 2023 by when he will be 38. Even if he went on for only another two years that would take him close to his 41st birthday passing a milestone he once scoffed at. So whats changed for Hamilton Why is a driver who is so determined to make an impact beyond what he does ontrack keen to keep on racing Hamilton admitted in Mexico last week that he wasnt sure what had changed his mind on wanting to keep racing after being 40. He mentioned this narrative of winding down towards the end as being something he did not subscribe to and that even with his outside interests the support of Mercedes to pursue them could keep him energised ontrack. Im just in a happy place said Hamilton. Im a lot more grounded Ive got my home that I get to spend time in in the UK when I come to see the team for example my family come down. I have a lot better setup just all round. And I feel like I can take the team to more championships. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes AMG Photo by Steve Etherington  Motorsport Images Hamilton has always made clear that breaking the record for the most championships by winning an eighth title is not something that will define his future even given the circumstances of his defeat to Max Verstappen last year. He has often talked about the journey Mercedes now finds itself on trying to return to the top after being toppled amid its struggles with the new technical regulations for 2022. Walking away while the team is yet to return to the top of the mountain does not seem to be something on Hamiltons radar. Hamilton admitted it was difficult to say how much of an impact the struggles of this year had on his motivation to keep going. If wed had a year like last year and we were competing at the front all year who knows where I would be he pondered. But he spoke of the energy he took from seeing the team come together in 2022 noting the new level vulnerability he has seen in many of his colleagues through the current struggles. Thats been a really interesting process and Im grateful to be a part of it said Hamilton. I cant wait for the time that we get back to success that we finally get that win and we get that championship. Its going to make all these tough moments worthwhile. As Hamilton has gotten further into his 30s he has often spoken of his improved physical condition citing his switch to a plantbased diet in 2018 as being a life changer. When it comes to his training he has also learned to adjust his regimen as the years have gone on as it gets harder for all of us to stay in peak physical condition. So its about being more meticulous with your diet being more meticulous with your training said Hamilton. Like for example I did pilates with a good friend of mine the other day thats an Olympic athlete and it was so funny because it was something that wed never really done before. Id done pilates but just adding different things that you wouldnt normally do being more specific with your daily routine way more than when I was 22  I wasnt doing the things that Im doing today. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes AMG Photo by Steve Etherington  Motorsport Images Hamilton also noted the importance of looked after his mental wellbeing to find good balance within your life including setting boundaries to protect his energy and prevent himself getting overloaded. I never let that get to that point Hamilton explained. Its just about being balanced. I say no to so many things. I get asked every day to do so many different things and Im able to push back and say no. If I know thats going to affect my preparation getting in the way of my training or my time with my team or have any possible impact on my race weekend its a big no. Thats with friends thats with relationships. This is what Im focused on. It has all given Hamilton the kind of longevity that very few athletes will ever enjoy. Two tennis icons Serena Williams and Roger Federer hung up their rackets this year after playing into their early 40s. Tom Brady a friend of Hamiltons has managed to extend his career in the NFL well into his 40s despite the physical demands of the game. All of them act as inspiration to Hamilton. Toto Wolff Hamiltons team principal at Mercedes felt the Brady comparison was apt. For me the best athlete in the world Tom Brady hes on the field and being tackled and throwing the ball and hes 43 years old he said. So as long as you continue to look after yourself and develop your cognitive sensors I think Hamilton has many more years in him. Im pretty certain thats going to be the case here in the team. Wolff plans to sit down with Hamilton during a quiet time over the winter to discuss his next contract which is set to run to at least the end of the 2025 season. The way that Hamilton is talking there is no reason why it has to be his last F1 renewal  and why turning 40 could be long in the past by the time he finally calls it quits. Im not putting a limit on it to be honest Hamilton said when asked how much longer he planned to stay with Mercedes only confirming he was planning to do a multiyear deal with my team. I really really dont know what the next five years hold I think were still trying to work on that he added. Theres a lot of great things that are being put in place like Ive just launched a production company this week. But I feel great in mind and body. I think theres more stuff to achieve together.

Mateschitz approved new Red Bull F1 windtunnel before death, https://the-race.com/formula-1/mateschitz-approved-new-red-bull-f1-windtunnel-before-death/, Red Bull is investing in a new windtunnel as one of the last commitments made by Dietrich Mateschitz to the Formula 1 operation. The windtunnel referred to recently as a relic of the Cold War by Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has limitations with temperature control because of the size and age of the building that houses it. It was one of the commitments that Dietrich made to the business to invest in a new tunnel he said in reference to Red Bull cofounder Mateschitz who died in October. The existing windtunnel came into the spotlight during the Mexican Grand Prix weekend in connection with Red Bulls penalty for breaking F1s budget cap in 2021. In recent years Red Bull and its technical chief Adrian Newey have been strong champions of F1 ditching windtunnels altogether and moving entirely to CFD development., Red Bull is investing in a new windtunnel as one of the last commitments made by Dietrich Mateschitz to the Formula 1 operation. Since Red Bull bought the Jaguar team in 2004 it has used the old Arrows windtunnel which was repurposed for F1 use having existed as an aircraft development facility since first operating as RAE Bedford in 1946. The windtunnel referred to recently as a relic of the Cold War by Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has limitations with temperature control because of the size and age of the building that houses it. It had been reported earlier this year that Red Bull was planning a new windtunnel that would take two years to build and be part of its technology campus in Milton Keynes bringing together all facets of the car and engine design and production in one location. Although it is unclear what stage the project is at Horner has told The Race it will happen. It was one of the commitments that Dietrich made to the business to invest in a new tunnel he said in reference to Red Bull cofounder Mateschitz who died in October. The existing windtunnel came into the spotlight during the Mexican Grand Prix weekend in connection with Red Bulls penalty for breaking F1s budget cap in 2021. It has been hit with a 10 reduction in the aerodynamic testing allowance it is permitted for the next 12 months and Horner said that punishment would be felt hard by Red Bull because of the windtunnels inefficiencies. Mateschitz wielded huge influence on F1 with such subtlety Read more In addition to properly regulating the temperature of the windtunnel Red Bulls takes time getting up to the maximum wind speed that makes for the most reliable measurements. Some of the time taken to reach this speed is also calculated within the testing limitations. The decision to build a new windtunnel was taken well before the budget cap saga even began let alone when the penalty emerged and will not be built until long after Red Bulls penalty has expired. It is an investment made because Red Bull feels its hand was forced by the gradual increase in restrictions on aerodynamic testing which has put an increasing emphasis on efficiency. While it would have preferred to avoid investing in a new tunnel it has effectively decided that in the current era of F1 its current facility is too outdated. Once the tunnel regulations were introduced then the efficiency of our tunnel just wasnt comparable with where the regulations are going said Horner. It forced our hand that we needed to make that big capital investment. Hed set the vision  Red Bulls F1 future without Mateschitz Read more So thats what weve chosen to do. The investment could have a limited value to Red Bull as like McLaren and Aston Martin it is building a new windtunnel at a time F1 has tentatively discussed a ban on windtunnels in 2030. This proposal had initial support from a majority of teams last year but without any real details when it was discussed this is not necessarily indicative of whether it will actually happen. Those who are opposed to the ban see the tunnels as major capital assets that would be a blow for teams to lose. In recent years Red Bull and its technical chief Adrian Newey have been strong champions of F1 ditching windtunnels altogether and moving entirely to CFD development. Horner said When you look at the way the worlds going simulation is playing a bigger and bigger role. We should have been brave enough to look at walking away from tunnels in the future. But unfortunately there was a fearbased culture rather than an embracing one.

More info Sebastian Vettel chose to snub childhood hero Michael Schumacher and Lewis Hamilton when naming the greatest driver to grace Formula One. Vettel who will retire at the end of the season has always favoured Schumacher after growing a close relationship with his German compatriot. Seventime world champion Schumacher was a mentor for Vettel when he first made it onto the F1 grid and the Aston Martin driver has since assumed a similar role for his son Mick as the youngster aims to make his own strides in the sport. But while Vettel has always favoured Schumacher over Brit Hamilton also a seventime title winner he has opted for Juan Manuel Fangio when discussing the greatest ever. Vettel was interacting with a fan at the Mexican Grand Prix and when asked about fivetime champion Fangio the 35yearold gave an emphatic response. Im a fan of Michael Schumacher but Fangio is a little better the best the best the king Vettel said. Fangios motorsport legacy lives on after he dominated F1 in its fledgling years. JUST IN Mercedes explain Lewis Hamilton engine cuts at Mexican GP Vettel has named his F1 GOAT The late Argentine won all five of his titles in the first decade of F1 after its inception in 1950. And Fangio remains the oldest driver ever to win an F1 title after his triumph in 1957. In total the driver nicknamed El Maestro won 24 of the 52 races that he entered. After Vettels assertion one man who will be looking to enter the debate that also includes the great Ayrton Senna is Red Bulls Max Verstappen. The 25yearold is already a multiple world champion and is well on course to being considered in the conversation with such illustrious names at the end of his career. The Dutchman eclipsed Vettel and Schumachers joint record of 13 race wins in a season with a dominant 14th victory of the year in Mexico. Vettel opted for Fangio over Schumacher
David Coulthard joins Mika Hakkinen in making confident Mercedes F1 cost cap claim, https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/mercedes-cost-cap-coulthard-hakkinen-28405159, But Coulthard does not believe the Silver Arrows will be tempted to ignore the cost cap going forward. Lets say McLaren Ferrari and Mercedes all go over the cost cap next year because theyre willing to take a 10 per cent reduction said the Scot. His words echoed those of fellow former racer Mika Hakkinen who described Red Bulls punishment as significant in a blog post. Red Bulls penalty for the minor overspend is still significant. That final point about publicity is exactly what Mercedes chief Toto Wolff said himself when asked for his reaction to Red Bulls penalty in Mexico., Some have questioned whether the punishment received by Red Bull for their overspend during the 2021 season is enough of a deterrent for other teams in the future David Coulthard does not believe Mercedes will risk breaking cost cap rules next year in the wake of Red Bulls punishment for their 2021 overspend. Last month the FIA revealed Red Bull had exceeded the budget cap the previous season by around 1.8m which came down to 432k once a tax credit was applied. As punishment they were fined 6m and will have 10 of their wind tunnel time taken away from them over the next 12 months. Some rivals seemed underwhelmed by that punishment. Mercedes trackside engineering director Andrew Shovlin appeared to be one of them as he baulked at Christian Horners claim that his team gained no competitive advantage from the overspend stressing Money buys performance. But Coulthard does not believe the Silver Arrows will be tempted to ignore the cost cap going forward. Lets say McLaren Ferrari and Mercedes all go over the cost cap next year because theyre willing to take a 10 per cent reduction said the Scot. They wont do it because 10 is 10  nobody wants a 10 reduction. So of course theyre going to say that because the shoe is not on their foot. But as sure as they are in Formula 1 therell be something thats controversial about their team in the future. His words echoed those of fellow former racer Mika Hakkinen who described Red Bulls punishment as significant in a blog post. The FIA recognised that there could be various levels of overspend and reasons for doing so wrote the Finn. Red Bulls penalty for the minor overspend is still significant. Far more than the financial or aerodynamic penalty it has been an uncomfortable experience for the team. Image PA PA The good thing is that no team will want to risk repeating this next year so although it has been a very difficult and controversial moment for Red Bull I believe it will benefit F1 in the long term because every team boss will be determined not to have this kind of negative publicity in future. That final point about publicity is exactly what Mercedes chief Toto Wolff said himself when asked for his reaction to Red Bulls penalty in Mexico. Beyond the sporting penalty and fine there is also reputational damage the Austrian told Sky Sports. In a world of transparency and good governance its just not on any more. Whatever team you are youre responsible for representing a brand your employees and your partners and thats why for us it wouldnt be something they would do.
Ross Chastain gains attention worldwide with Martinsville move, https://nascar.nbcsports.com/2022/11/03/ross-chastain-gains-worldwide-attention-with-martinsville-move/, Hes such a little car guy. We got our car really good there at the end. I had a really good run. Its unfortunate thats when it came but overall it was a good day. On to whats next for me.Chase Elliott  Finished 28th Asked about contact with Ross Chastain Yeah Im not sure., What drivers said after Sundays NASCAR Cup Series championship race at Phoenix Raceway won by Joey Logano who scored his second title Joey Logano  winner Loganos son Hudson rode with him to Victory Lane. Weve had so many conversations over the last couple weeks before bedtime. First was Daddy isnt going to get a pole and hes going to meet me out here and were going to win the race and I couldnt be a liar to my son. So its worked out. Ever since Kevin Harvick gave his son a ride in the car I always wanted to do that with Hudson. Hes such a little car guy. It was a special moment to ride together. Man I cant say enough about this race team. They just grind it out. Theyre so amazing Paul Wolfe everybody that puts so much time and effort into the last few weeks. And not just this 22 team this goes so much deeper when you think of Roush Yates Engines and the motor thats in this bad boy. You think of everyone at Ford all the employees at Shell and Pennzoil everyone thats supported me. Its been 10 years with Shell and to get a couple championships and 31 wins is special. Ryan Blaney  Finished second I wish we could have won one. We had a great car to do it and it just didnt happen. Im proud of the effort. We had a winning car and it just didnt happen. You cant pass anybody. You get behind someone and get tight and it takes your air away and thats all you can do. Ross Chastain  Finished third Starting better and racing up there with those guys all day would have helped. We got our car really good there at the end. Hats off to Phil Surgen crew chief and everybody at Trackhouse. Its incredible to build from 2011. To have my family push me away from the farm to chase this dream. For my mom my dad and my brother to come out and keep pushing me keep supporting me and keep being there for me. But today was all about winning the big trophy and we came up just a little bit short. I think we did everything right there at the end. That was a heck of a drive by us. Who had the No. 1 car second in points on their bingo card on February 1 This is pretty wild. This is a continuation of a lot of people believing in me. To build everything together to come drive this car there are so many team owners and so many crew members that have put in the work. Its pretty wild to fight for a Cup Series championship and to have a car fast enough to chase them down to the end. On contact with Chase Elliott I think I got a better start. I got to his leftrear and he tried to cover it late and I was already there. I feel like it was just hard racing and I had position. We could have raced down in the corner sidebyside if he had just kept going the way we were going. I had a really good run. It looked like William Byron didnt get going quite as well as he wanted to. I got to the left of Elliott and saw an erratic move that he made to turn left to cover it but I was already there. Chase Briscoe  Finished fourth I just didnt fire off near as good near the finish. I was kind of on top of the racetrack a little bit more than I really had been all day. Truthfully the 22 and the 12 were so good on the short run every time. I just had nothing for them. On the long run I was typically a little bit better. I just would give up so much on the short run. I just didnt fire off very good there at the end. I dont really know why. I dont know if the track just changed there as the sun was going down. It wasnt as good. I felt that was the worst run balancewise we had all day. Its unfortunate thats when it came but overall it was a good day. I definitely feel like were a topfive team week in and week out especially these last 10 weeks. Its just a matter of putting it all together. This was one of the best races we ran start to finish today but we just came up a little bit short. We still have to get a little bit better but we definitely got closer to where we need to be. Kevin Harvick  Finished fifth On the restarts I kept getting on the chip and getting hung in gear and we would get passed by a couple of cars. I just needed a whole run. Christopher Bell  Finished 10th Wow wow wow. Just from being out and then the wins at Charlotte and Martinsville and all of a sudden you wake up this morning and you are racing for a championship and you are happy you are elated and then your world comes crashing down. Whenever you get news like that it puts it in perspective that there is more to this than racing. The whole Gibbs family is in all of our prayers. Im thinking of them. Ultimately today the best car won the championship. He was really strong. Proud of our 20 group though. We fought hard and at the end of the race  the last pit stop or what we thought was going to be the last pit stop we were right there battling for it. Im just proud to be in this position proud to be at Joe Gibbs Racing and race this no. 20 car. The DeWalt Camry was  we were there and hopefully we can come back here next year. I feel good about where we are at for sure. Im hopeful that my group stays the exact same from mechanics engineers and obviously Adam Stevens on top of the pit box because I feel like we have a good thing going. We feel like we are right there on the brink of being there every week and being a title contender yearin and yearout. Just really thankful to be here and very very incredibly saddened by the news today and Im thinking of the Gibbs family. Austin Dillon  Finished 13th We had a solid day at Phoenix Raceway. Our Get Bioethanol Chevrolet started off tight but throughout the day we were able to adjust on it and be in the fight at the end. There werent many cautions during the race today so we had to be on top of our adjustments. Our pit crew did a great job on pit road and Justin Alexander laid out a good strategy that kept us in the top 20 all day. To leave the last race of the year finishing 13th and taking home 11th in points gives my RCR team momentum to start the 2023 season. Tyler Reddick  Finished 23rd Im really proud of this whole teams effort over the years. We have come such a long way in three years time. I learned a lot with this group. Anything I wanted to learn and anything I wanted to do theyve given me the platform to learn and be a better driver. Im just really thankful for everyones efforts over the years from everyone at RCR and ECR Engines for the fantastic power that weve had. We all worked hard and were able to do a lot of great things and I will always remember that. We had high hopes for our day and we were pretty close with our Cheddars Scratch Kitchen Chevrolet. Unfortunately we had a little bit of a tough day on pit road and that put us back there in the mess. We got caught fourwide going into Turn 3. That doesnt work and we got quite a bit of damage that pretty much set us back for the rest of the day. At the very end there we were able to get it back where it needed to be but we just ran out of time. Ty Dillon  Finished 26th We rebounded there at the end. Our Petty GMS team was able to get the car a little bit better towards the end of the race. Id say it was a decent end to the year. Im grateful to have had the opportunity to drive the No. 42 Chevy this season. We had a lot of memories made this season and I had a lot of fun behind the wheel. Thank you to Maury Gallagher Richard Petty the fans and all of our partners. On to whats next for me. Chase Elliott  Finished 28th Asked about contact with Ross Chastain Yeah Im not sure. Im not sure. Looking forward to the offseason and really proud of our team for the fight that we put in today. I felt like we just kind of peaked right there before we crashed and I felt like we got our car driving pretty good. We just had our best pit stop of the day so that was all really solid. And heck we were right there next to the 22 winner Joey Logano. I thought we had a shot at it all the way up until we didnt and thats unfortunately the way it goes sometimes. I feel like we had gotten it driving about as good as it had been all weekend honestly. When we split the stage and some of those guys stayed out and ran long and we went a lap down and made our lap back up there under green that run I thought our car was driving pretty good. Brad Keselowski  Finished 35th It just caught fire and the next thing I knew we were sitting there. Its a bummer but well hopefully learn something from it and move on. Were making a lot of progress. Its obviously a bummer way to end the season but a lot of progress as a company and we need to have a big offseason of learning.
Nikita Mazepin has surprise new career after his F1 hopes went up in flames, https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/nikita-mazepin-career-now-dj-28404414, But Haas quickly made the decision to cut ties with both Mazepin and sponsor Uralkali the company owned by his oligarch father. Perhaps aware he will struggle to find another drive in motorsport it appears Mazepin has turned his attention to other ventures. After one of the photos was shared across social media some F1 fans couldnt resist poking fun at the Russian. Mazepin has previously suggested he could one day return to F1  but not with Haas after accusing team principal Guenther Steiner of lacking human qualities. I think one day I will be in F1 as a businessman but there is no hurry., Mazepin managed just one season in Formula 1 with Haas before he was unceremoniously sacked by the team in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February Nikita Mazepin has surprise new career after his F1 hopes went up in flames Nikita Mazepin looks to have embarked on a new career as an events planner after being axed from Formula 1. The Russian racer made his F1 debut with Haas but failed to score a single point during the 2021 season as the team fielded two entirely uncompetitive cars. He was set to be given a second crack alongside Mick Schumacher this year but things changed after Russia launched their invasion of Ukraine. The FIA made it clear drivers from Russia would still be allowed to compete provided they did not represent their country and did not voice any support of their countrys belligerence. But Haas quickly made the decision to cut ties with both Mazepin and sponsor Uralkali the company owned by his oligarch father. Perhaps aware he will struggle to find another drive in motorsport it appears Mazepin has turned his attention to other ventures. His latest seems to be an event planning firm called The Ninety Nine Events which threw a big Halloweenthemed bash this week. Photos published on his Instagram account show partygoers in fancy dress enjoying themselves in front of a large screen with Mazepins surname displayed in large letters. Another snap shows the former racer wearing headphones while operating DJ decks. This year I had to say goodbye to Formula 1 for a while he wrote in the caption. But in order to open up to something different it is important to come to terms with setbacks and trouble. If one path for selfexpression is closed then you need to look for another. For the first time I come before you in such a role. Its great that you can discover new frontiers and find opportunities for development in your own projects. After one of the photos was shared across social media some F1 fans couldnt resist poking fun at the Russian. Cant spin a car anymore so hes spinning tracks instead wrote one in reference to the Mazespin nickname he was given by some over his habit of losing control of his car during his one and only F1 season. He probably crashed the computer he was playing the music on joked another. Mazepin has previously suggested he could one day return to F1  but not with Haas after accusing team principal Guenther Steiner of lacking human qualities. He said When a team boss behaves like that then I think there are nine other teams with whom I can have a dialogue. I think one day I will be in F1 as a businessman but there is no hurry.

Ralf Schumacher suggests Haas could drop Magnussen for 2023, https://racingnews365.com/ralf-schumacher-suggests-haas-could-drop-magnussen-for-2023, However sixtime Grand Prix winner Ralf has suggested that Haas might be better advised to retain Schumacher and replace Magnussen with Hulkenberg. Ralf Schumacher has suggested that the Haas Formula 1 team could potentially drop Kevin Magnussen for the 2023 season. Schumacher on MagnussenWith Mick Schumacher is his second F1 season he has come in for criticism for a number of unforced errors with heavy shunts in Jeddah Monaco and Suzuka drawing a public rebuke from Steiner. Speaking to Sky Germany Ralf Schumacher points to this upturn in form as a case for retaining Mick Schumacher. As of the Mexican Grand Prix Magnussen has 24 points and is 13th in the Drivers Championship while Schumachers tally of 12 puts him 16th in the standings., However sixtime Grand Prix winner Ralf has suggested that Haas might be better advised to retain Schumacher and replace Magnussen with Hulkenberg. One of the final seats on the grid for next season is currently available at Haas with it expected to go to either incumbent Mick Schumacher  Ralfs nephew  or Nico Hulkenberg with Kevin Magnussen already on a multiyear deal with the team. Ralf Schumacher has suggested that the Haas Formula 1 team could potentially drop Kevin Magnussen for the 2023 season. Schumacher on Magnussen With Mick Schumacher is his second F1 season he has come in for criticism for a number of unforced errors with heavy shunts in Jeddah Monaco and Suzuka drawing a public rebuke from Steiner. However his form improved partway through the season with strong points finishes at the British and Austrian Grands Prix helping his case for staying in the sport. Speaking to Sky Germany Ralf Schumacher points to this upturn in form as a case for retaining Mick Schumacher. Anything is possible of course especially if we look at the last few races said Schumacher. Who knows Magnussen may not be so firmly in the seat anymore. If we look at the races since Silverstone we have to conclude that Mick is the more stable and better of the two drivers  and who has also had some bad luck with wrong strategies. In the last race Mexcio Mick was sometimes up to sixtenths faster than Magnussen  so lets wait and see for the next few races. I hope Haas make a decision soon. Maybe next year we will have two Germans on the Formula 1 grid. Since the British GP in July Schumacher has finished more races ahead of Magnussen than vice versa  five vs four when both cars finished  although the Dane has scored points more often. As of the Mexican Grand Prix Magnussen has 24 points and is 13th in the Drivers Championship while Schumachers tally of 12 puts him 16th in the standings.
Why Formula 1's overseer was right to penalise Red Bull, https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/11/03/why-formula-1s-overseer-was-right-to-penalise-red-bull, In 2021 the FIA introduced a cap on teams spending to try to increase competition on the grid. In that year the big prize the drivers championship was won in controversial circumstances by Max Verstappen while his team Red Bull came second in the constructors competition. Several weeks ago the FIA announced that Red Bull had breached the spending cap that season. Red Bull reacted furiously insisting it had complied with the rules. Zak Brown chief executive of McLaren accused Red Bull of cheating and demanded financial and sporting penalties., AS MANY PARENTS know to their cost empty threats are woefully ineffective. Once children twig that mum or dad is unwilling to follow through with the denial of pocket money or confinement to the house authority is lost. The lesson is a useful one for sporting authorities too. One that seems to have learned it is the Fdration Internationale de lAutomobile  FIA  the governing body of Formula 1 motor racing. And one that needs to is UEFA  which supposedly rules over European football. In 2021 the FIA introduced a cap on teams spending to try to increase competition on the grid. Constructors were limited to spending 145m on research and development and on building and testing cars. Other expenses such as drivers salaries and marketing were exempt. In that year the big prize the drivers championship was won in controversial circumstances by Max Verstappen while his team Red Bull came second in the constructors competition. Several weeks ago the FIA announced that Red Bull had breached the spending cap that season. The breachspending up to 5 above the capwas the second most serious of the four categories. The Aston Martin team was also found to be in breach but in a lesser procedural category. Red Bull reacted furiously insisting it had complied with the rules. Its rivals were furious too. Zak Brown chief executive of McLaren accused Red Bull of cheating and demanded financial and sporting penalties. When the FIA handed down Red Bulls punishment at the end of October it predictably satisfied no one. It fined the team 7m a good deal more than the sum by which it had overspent and cut the amount of time it will be allowed to spend on aerodynamic testing over the next 12 months by 10. Red Bulls boss Christian Horner called the penalties draconian and complained that the reduction in windtunnel time would hurt his teams competitiveness. Meanwhile his counterpart at Mercedes Toto Wolff said that the punishment was too little. Yet having tightened its rules the FIA acted in the only way that made senseeven if people on either side might grumble that it was too severe or too lenient. The weakness of its counterpart in European football provides a contrasting and cautionary tale. A decade ago with Europes big clubs spending ever more on players some of them recklessly UEFA drew up financial fair play  FFP  rules. It declared that teams annual expenditure on player transfers and wages should not exceed revenues from broadcasting ticket and commercial activities by more than 5m then 5.7m. Two of Europes most wellheeled clubs Paris St Germain and Manchester City which are both financed by petrodollars were soon investigated for suspected breaches. In both cases UEFA was concerned that the clubs outlays on players could not be justified by their income which appeared to have been inflated by sponsorship deals with companies linked to their Middle Eastern owners. Yet in 2018 UEFA concluded that PSGs deals just about complied with the rules. To reach this conclusion UEFA accepted valuations assessed by firms hired by the club rather than the much lower sums proposed by analysts commissioned by the governing body itself. UEFA did ban Manchester City from European competition for two years and fined the club 30mbut the next year the Court of Arbitration for Sport the highest legal body in sport overturned the ban and cut the fine to 10m not enough to buy a secondrate centrehalf. That wasnt because the CAS found that City had kept to the rules but because UEFA had taken too long to investigate. FFP became a laughing stock. It was quietly scrapped and in mid2022 was replaced with new regulations. By the middle of the decade clubs will have to limit spending on wages transfers and agents to 70 of revenue. This will mean big changes to the business models of many clubs. But the effectiveness of the regulations will depend entirely on UEFA s appetite for bringing transgressors to heel. UEFA may fear that if it tries to be harsh big clubs will set up their own competitions as they have previously threatened to do.

Step Aside Lewis Hamilton Formula 1 Has Entered the Max Verstappen Era, https://www.autoweek.com/racing/formula-1/a41854877/step-aside-lewis-hamilton-formula-1-has-entered-the-max-verstappen-era/, Haas F1 team principal Guenther Steiner says that F1 has turned the page on Lewis Hamilton and its now the Max Verstappen era. Modern Formula 1 has gone from the Michael Schumacher era to the Sebastian Vettel era to Lewis Hamilton era to a new era according to Haas F1 team principal Guenther Steiner. Steiner says welcome to the Max Verstappen era. In this era its just Max Steiner told the German broadcaster NTV. Formula has a new king of the mountain and its Max Verstappen., Haas F1 team principal Guenther Steiner says that F1 has turned the page on Lewis Hamilton and its now the Max Verstappen era. Verstappen follows the dynasties of Michael Schumacher seven championships Sebastian Vettel four championships and Hamilton seven championships. Red Bull consultant Dr. Helmut Marko says it might be to early to pencil in Verstappen for a long run of championships. Modern Formula 1 has gone from the Michael Schumacher era to the Sebastian Vettel era to Lewis Hamilton era to a new era according to Haas F1 team principal Guenther Steiner. Steiner says welcome to the Max Verstappen era. Although the 2021 season finale and this years budget cap scandal muddied Verstappens achievements Steiner says the Verstappen era is similar to the Hamilton Vettel and Schumacher eras that preceded it. Every era has its champion. In this era its just Max Steiner told the German broadcaster NTV. We are right in the middle of that era now. Hes got the talent the drive hes just a master at the moment. Formula has a new king of the mountain and its Max Verstappen. NurPhoto Getty Images As for who might challenge Verstappens superiority next year Steiner answered I think Charles Leclercs driving skills are very good at the moment. But sometimes he still makes mistakesa little too many mistakes. And Max just doesnt make them anywhere. Steiner also believes that seventime world champion Lewis Hamilton is still good. Max however is the man now. To be champion you need that little bit extra. A certain coolness a certain extra bit of luck too Steiner said. Max is just riding a wave at the moment and he doesnt want to get off it. Some however say Verstappens dominance is already boring. Take the cakewalk Verstappen had in Mexico where only two cars were within 49 seconds of him at the finish. When asked about that Red Bull consultant Dr. Helmut Marko told Osterreich Unfortunately we cant take that into account. For the rest Max delivers anything but boring races. In Austria for example his races are rewarded with top ratings. Marko though doesnt expect Verstappens current level of dominance to carry over into 2023. We approach the matter realistically said the 79yearold Austrian. It is indeed amazing how the season has turned out. You couldnt have predicted that Max would be in such form. Unfortunately its not enough for the 19 wins in one season Marko added referring to Mercedes win total as a team in 2016. When told that Red Bull could target that for 2023 Marko answered I hardly think its possible for everything to fit together like this for another season. However Max has not yet reached the end of his development. He is even more mature faster tirefriendly. Theres still incredible room for improvement.

Room for one more F1 race in the Americas says Mexican GP promoter, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/room-for-one-more-f1-race-in-the-americas-says-mexican-gp-promoter/10394392/, With grands prix also taking place in Canada and Brazil there will be six races in the Americas in 2023. So I think thats good for the region for the timezone that is very good. So with Canada three races in the United States Mexico and Brazil the question is if there room for another one Its a great show and a great window to present Mexico in a good fashion to the world. I would rather to have a race every other year than have no race at all., Listen to this article Last weekends race at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez in Mexico City attracted a sellout crowd of 397000 fans over three days once again making it one of the bestattended races of the season. The continued strong fan presence in Mexico comes amid F1s current boom in the neighbouring United States which will host three races next year in Miami Austin and Las Vegas. With grands prix also taking place in Canada and Brazil there will be six races in the Americas in 2023. But amid continued interest from countries in hosting a grand prix in the future Alejandro Soberon the chief executive of CIE that promotes the race in Mexico felt there would be scope to add another event in the Americas. We love competition its good because it keeps you in shape and alert said Soberon. Three races in the States before it was unthinkable. Today it even looks reasonable. I think Miami is going to be a very big success. You saw the attendance in Austin. Its much better than other years its a stronger race. And all the presales in Vegas are through the roof. So I think thats good for the region for the timezone that is very good. So with Canada three races in the United States Mexico and Brazil the question is if there room for another one My personal belief is there is room for another one. But it doesnt have to go against another race in the same timezone. It can go against another timezone. So whos going to be at risk how competitive is that offer Its going to be very interesting. Lance Stroll Aston Martin waves to the crowd on the drivers parade Photo by Sam Bloxham  Motorsport Images Mexico announced on Thursday that it had signed a new threeyear contract ensuring F1 will continue to visit the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez until at least 2025. But Soberon explained that come the next renewal there could be a new government and city mayor in place following the elections in 2024. Mexico initially returned to the calendar in 2015 with a deal that was funded by the federal government but a change in the government meant the Mexico City mayor and her administration took over securing the funding for the race for the existing deal and the renewal. Soberon felt confident the grand prix would continue to get national support regardless of the ruling bodies believing everyone in the country was very proud about the race. They love Checo Perez what hes achieving said Soberon. Its a great show and a great window to present Mexico in a good fashion to the world. Today there are more and more cities interested in getting a slot on the calendar. I think that basically means that everybody needs to move faster trying to make the alliance of interest to make it happen because I think Formula 1 is in a great position today. F1 will hold a recordbreaking 24race season in 2023 reaching the limit set out by the Concorde Agreement after adding a new event in Las Vegas as well as bringing China and Qatar back to the schedule. Series bosses are known to be exploring calendar rotation as a potential way to ensure more markets particularly those in Europe can hold events every other year. Asked about the possibility of Mexico rotating in the future if required Soberon said When you have every year sold out and every year you sell it faster than the year before its something as a promoter you dont want to consider. Why should I have every other year a race when I can have one every year Im very competitive I deliver good dollars to Formula 1 and its a great market the Mexican market has a lot to do with the success in the States. The Hispanic population is very fond of races there. But you know for some countries that cannot manage to have the right funding certainly its going to be an option to do. I would rather to have a race every other year than have no race at all.
Additional U.S. F1 races good for Mexican GP promoter believes, https://racer.com/2022/11/03/additional-u-s-f1-races-good-for-mexican-gp-promoter-believes/, The expansion of the Formula 1 calendar with three races in the United States has been a positive move for the Mexico City Grand Prix according to the races promoter Alejandro Soberon. Mexico City rejoined the F1 schedule in 2015 three years after Circuit of The Americas returned the sport to the USA after an absence of five years. So I think thats good for the region for the time zone its very good. And everybody knows its a good race its a great experience. Mexico City is a very interesting city to come and do more things than the race., The expansion of the Formula 1 calendar with three races in the United States has been a positive move for the Mexico City Grand Prix according to the races promoter Alejandro Soberon. Mexico City rejoined the F1 schedule in 2015 three years after Circuit of The Americas returned the sport to the USA after an absence of five years. Since then interest in the States has grown to the point where there will be three events in 2023 but Soberon  the CEO and president of race promoter Corporacion Interamericana de Entretenimiento CIE  says theres even space for another race in the region. Im not sure about Central America but three races in the States before it was a challenge now it even looks reasonable Soberon said. I think Miamis going to be a very big success you saw the attendance in Austin is much better than other years so its a stronger race in Austin and all the presales in Vegas are through the roof. So I think thats good for the region for the time zone its very good. Canada three races in the U.S. Mexico and Brazil. The question is is there room for another one My personal view is there is room for another one but it doesnt have to go against another race in the same time zone. It can go against another time zone. We have many clients of ours who went to Miami. They loved Miami and they loved the race in Miami but they came back and they secured their tickets in Mexico and said Being there was great probably I will go back but I love my race. Soberon says the higher ticket prices in America also help to make Mexico City a viable alternative option to U.S.based F1 fans. On the contrary that more American races hurt sales because when you compare the price and the packaging to come here were very competitive. And everybody knows its a good race its a great experience. Mexico City is a very interesting city to come and do more things than the race. Then maybe instead of taking three days you take a week and come and see the restaurants and the culture in the city and interesting places. So it becomes beyond a race  it goes deeper than that. A further race in the Americas has been mooted in Colombia after a visit to Barranquilla by F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali earlier this week although RACER understands that is one of just many meetings that the sport has lined up due to the level of interest in new host venues wanting to join the calendar.

That ensured Maserati was required to effectively act in good faith and release De Vries. Speaking of his move to Maserati Guenther said he was sure that next year Im going to be a better driver after all of the experiences Ive had., The new Maserati team has announced Maximilian Guenther as Edoardo Mortaras teammate for its first Formula E world championship season in 2023. The Race first reported last month that Guenther was in line for the seat and his confirmation means one of the last slots on the 2023 grid has been filled with just McLaren now waiting to announce the anticipated name of Jake Hughes to partner Rene Rast. Guenther will embark on his fourth full Formula E season after previously driving for Dragon BMW i Andretti and Nissan e.dams. De Vries was on AlphaTauris radar earlier than you might think Read more The 25yearolds chance with the Maserati MSG team formerly known as Venturi effectively came after Nyck de Vries finally got his Formula 1 opportunity with AlphaTauri recently. The 2021 Formula E champion had agreed terms of a deal with Maserati earlier this year to join Mortara as he weighed up several options for his 2023 campaign which also included F1 possibilities and a likely drive with Toyota in the World Endurance Championship. Maserati is believed to have realised even before the Italian Grand Prix where De Vries stood in for Alex Albon at Williams that it would not have the Dutchman and that he had options for an F1 drive in 2023. This was subsequently rubberstamped via his AlphaTauri deal which was announced in October. That ensured Maserati was required to effectively act in good faith and release De Vries. It then deployed alternative plans for Mortaras teammate. These included the scoping out of Oliver Turvey Alex Lynn and Formula 2 driver Theo Pourchaire in addition to Guenther who was in talks with the team from an early stage. The German is believed to have got the nod due to his track record with the BMW i Andretti team with which he scored three EPrix victories between 2019 and 2020 in Santiago below New York and Berlin. Formula Es most successful team will miss 2023 season Read more Guenther and Nissan e.dams agreed to part ways amicably last July and is known to have held talks with both McLaren and the remnants of the Techeetah squad which now not race until the 2024 season at the earliest. Speaking of his move to Maserati Guenther said he was sure that next year Im going to be a better driver after all of the experiences Ive had. Ive won a few races and it has been a cool journey but now whats ahead of me is super exciting because I have a fantastic team around me and we want to build something strong together he added. If you ask me my ambitions the ultimate goal is to win the Formula E world championship and this is what I want to achieve with this team. Mortara stays with the team he has effectively been an everpresent with since 2017. He has scored six EPrix wins the first of which came in Hong Kong in March 2019 when he was promoted to the top spot after Sam Bird was penalised for an incident with Andre Lotterer. His most recent came in last Julys Marrakesh EPrix. Why Gen3 Formula E era is in trouble before its even begun Read more The Race understands that Mortara has conducted several test days with the DS performancerun Gen3 test and development car. Gunther meanwhile got his first experience with the car last week. Shared testing of the DS test and development car will continue in Spain next week. In addition to Guenthers programme with Maserati it is believed that he could also test the Peugeot Hypercar in the near future. Guenther is known to have wanted to expand his career into sportscar racing since early 2022 and visited the Spa WEC paddock in May where he spoke at length to teams and manufacturers. Maserati confirmed it would enter Formula E in April after its group owner the Stellantis Group took the decision to enter a second brand in the allelectric world championship. In addition to Maserati Stellantisowned DS Automobiles has raced since 2015 initially with Virgin Racing and then Techeetah. Maserati will use DSbuilt powertrains for at least 2023 and 2024 as a designated customer even though it is technically a registered manufacturer in the championship in its own right. Speaking at Maseratis official launch in Modena on Thursday Giovanni Tommaso Sgro Head Of Maserati Corse said he was delighted to welcome Max and Edo into the Trident family for season 9 in what is set to be an exciting and electrifying new era in Formula E. Is Formula Es rule tweak for Maserati wise or risky Read more Were proud to be back on track where we belong powered by passion and innovative by nature said Sgro. In the race for performance well be taking Maserati forward as we charge on the streets of the worlds most iconic cities. Formula E is more than just a racing series for us its a competitive platform bringing new technologies to accelerate the development of high efficiency electrified powertrains and intelligent software for our sport road cars. And as the first Italian brand to join were looking forward to setting in motion our full electric Folgore strategy.
Ricciardo has felt like "a passenger" at times amid McLaren F1 struggles, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/ricciardo-has-felt-like-a-passenger-at-times-amid-mclaren-f1-struggles/10394511/, Ricciardo admitted that it was the first time he had felt so comfortable with the 2022 car. Not to be negative I dont even want to look ahead I just want to take today for what it is. So just to have an attacking race and especially for me with this car to feel like I can attack a little bit more with it its just a nice feeling. So thats where its just I felt a little bit helpless at times. But Ill take today and enjoy it and Im happy weve got a week off so I can enjoy it for a week., Listen to this article The Australian put in his best performance of the year in Mexico City last weekend using a successful mediumsoft tyre strategy that gave him the pace with which to charge up to seventh place  while negating a 10second penalty for colliding with Yuki Tsunoda. The race came just a week after one of Ricciardos most disappointing outings of the season in Austin where he finished a lowly 16th 10 places behind teammate Lando Norris. Ricciardo admitted that it was the first time he had felt so comfortable with the 2022 car. I guess better late than never he said. Im going to take today for what it is Im going to enjoy it and appreciate that we did our pace and it was awesome and whatever. I hope it means that itll be like that the next two races. Not to be negative I dont even want to look ahead I just want to take today for what it is. And hopefully weve learned something from it. Even the points finishes even probably last year I feel we were normally defending rather than attacking. So just to have an attacking race and especially for me with this car to feel like I can attack a little bit more with it its just a nice feeling. He said that it was good to bounce back in style after feeling so frustrated after the US race. Of course its not typical in a place like Austin for me to feel like that he said after the flag in Mexico. Theres so much about that weekend that I love. So it has to be pretty bad for me to feel like that in a place like that. Its just theres been a lot of times where Ive felt a little bit like a passenger in a way I just feel like Ive worked with such little grip that no amount of talent is going to get the job done if you know what I mean. So thats where its just I felt a little bit helpless at times. So you feel like you cant show really anything that youve got because youre just not operating on the level of the others. So today to kind of be able to at least lean on it and push and have pace and be a guy thats setting quick times makes me happy. I wish it could have been like this more often. But Ill take today and enjoy it and Im happy weve got a week off so I can enjoy it for a week. Asked by Motorsport.com if he felt that hed proved a point Ricciardo said I still know I can get the job done its hard when you cant do it week in and week out. Its a bit like Sebastian Vettel those last few races he did phenomenal races and then people are questioning is it time to retire I think all of us can still do it on our day. Obviously its just the consistency for whatever reason. But I still love it. And I still want to get to the front.

TREMAYNE: Mercedes’ resurgence means we could be in for a thrilling end to 2022, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.tremayne-mercedes-resurgence-means-we-could-be-in-for-a-thrilling-end-to.32wqr9ZB34HSn5Qb8mWAvY.html, But perhaps its even more significant that the question in the aftermath was whether Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes should have won. Lewis Hamilton finished second at Mexico but should he have gone one better Both Mercedes started on the medium tyres while the Red Bulls were on the softs  did that call cost Hamilton victory Thats one of the delicious conundrums now that the championship titles have been settled in Max and Red Bulls favour. Hamilton believes the ability to hold on to Verstappen in the first stint was a clear sign of Mercedes progress, The very fact that wed all been discussing on Sunday morning whether Mercedes could win the Mexico City Grand Prix is a sign of just how much progress they have made in recent races. But perhaps its even more significant that the question in the aftermath was whether Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes should have won. One of the abiding questions which may be answered in the upcoming final races of the 2022 season in Brazil and Abu Dhabi is whether the upturn in performance was trackspecific. READ MORE We know where we need to improve says Hamilton after P2 in Mexico The previous week at the Circuit of The Americas where Lewis has always excelled and Mercedes final upgrade of the year seemed beneficial the Red Bull still simply had too much pace. This time however the peculiarities of the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez appeared to deal the Silver Arrows a very strong hand just like it used to do to Red Bull in their highrake preground effect days. In the runup team boss Toto Wolff said On paper Mexico looks good our draggy car should be effective in the thin air. I hope we can give them a run for their money. Lewis Hamilton finished second at Mexico but should he have gone one better The track the thirdshortest circuit on the 2022 F1 calendar is 7350ft above sea level. Thats the highest of any and that altitude and the low air density in Mexico City is less efficient at cooling hot things such as power units and brakes and if teams arent careful their maximised cooling arrangements can play havoc with the aerodynamics. The ambient pressure is easily the lowest of the season and this too has a significant impact on things such as a power units breathing and performance and also affects downforce. The paradox is that while teams run their highest levels  exactly what they would round the streets of Monaco or the Hungaroring where top speed matters much less than cornering force  the cars still top out at close to 225 mph down the Mexican tracks long front straight. DRIVER MARKET Hamilton targeting multiyear contract renewal with Mercedes So Mercedes were hopeful that their aerodynamically draggy W13 might have a performance advantage in these odd conditions and so it seemed. George Russell topped the third and final practice session on Saturday before Lewis set the fastest times in the first two segments of qualifying. In the third which decides the first five rows of the grid he had his first run time deleted for a track limits violation and thus had to be very slightly more circumspect on his second to make sure of setting a time. As Max Verstappen set yet another pole position for Red Bull George was second and Lewis third just fivethousandths of a second slower than his team mate after an engine glitch. Both Mercedes drivers believed they could have been on pole. The auguries for the race thus seemed positive. Russell and Hamilton finished behind Verstappen in qualifying but both felt they missed an opportunity at pole And while Lewis always says he isnt interested in records he is currently still the only world champion ever to have won a race in each of his years in F1 and in his heart he would like to maintain that one. But now that the US and Mexico lie behind us only two opportunities remain and both would appear in different ways to favour Red Bull and perhaps Ferrari who had an appalling time in Mexico. So what went wrong for the Silver Arrows Why did Lewis finish 15.186s adrift of Max further back than in America And George fourth albeit with fastest lap Lewis said he suggested starting on the soft Pirelli tyres in the race morning strategy meeting and that when the tyre warmers came off the cars on the grid and he saw that the Red Bulls were on that compound his heart sank. I thought shoot he said using one of his favourite expressions because he and George were on the medium tyres Mercedes boffins believing that they would last longer than the softs in the first stint. READ MORE Russell takes positives from Mercedes performance despite frustrating P4 finish at Mexico City GP That would give Mercedes cars track position when Max and Sergio Perez had to make earlier pit stops to change to mediums and that when they switched their own cars to the hardcompound rubber it would pay off in the run to the finish as Red Bulls mediums wore out sooner. It was a mistake because the performance of the mediums didnt drop off and Wolff readily admitted it afterwards. The softs did well early on and when Sergio was the first to stop having shadowed Lewis after the latter had battled past George in the third corner after the start and then himself jumped the younger Briton Mercedes were obliged to cover him by stopping Lewis sooner than they had intended. Both Mercedes started on the medium tyres while the Red Bulls were on the softs  did that call cost Hamilton victory George meanwhile ever prepared to speak out for what he wants and believes in didnt want to stop so soon but was only allowed to stay out another five laps. McLarens Daniel Ricciardo stayed out until Lap 45 on his medium then switched to softs for the final 26 laps and electrified his fading career with a very strong run to seventh indicating the strategy that might have been better for Mercedes. The Red Bulls especially Maxs performed perfectly to the end on their mediums whereas both Mercedes drivers understood within laps of taking them that the hards had been a big mistake. READ MORE Wolff satisfied with rigourous Cost Cap process as Shovlin calls Horners draconian penalty claim an exaggeration So thats the most likely reason why Mercedes didnt win when perhaps they might have been able to had they wrested track position away from Max early in the race by running the same softmedium tyre strategy. But there was also the sneaking feeling that Red Bull still had a slight performance edge. Some days you get it right some you dont. Thats racing and Mercs boffins believed they were taking a worthwhile gamble. Hindsight after all is 2020 vision. Daniel Ricciardo went long on the mediums before switching to the softs which is what George Russell had suggested As it was Mercedes thrashed the Ferraris which looked woeful as they had to turn their engines down all weekend to maintain sensible temperatures. But does this all mean that Mercedes will be in the fight with their two rivals in the final races Thats one of the delicious conundrums now that the championship titles have been settled in Max and Red Bulls favour. TECH TUESDAY Why Mercedes experimental front wing caused a stir in Texas Lewis was adamant that being able to keep up with Max in the first stint  despite their different tyre compounds  and to keep Sergio behind him throughout was a clear indication that they have made a significant performance jump. And from the way he and George spoke afterwards they both clearly expect it to be similarly beneficial in Brazil and Abu Dhabi. Just how beneficial remains to be seen however. So many positives to take from this weekend Lewis said. And this is definitely the most competitive and the best the car has felt all year  and that is truly down to the amazing work from all the women and men back at the factory who have just been doing such an amazing job. And not giving up. Hamilton believes the ability to hold on to Verstappen in the first stint was a clear sign of Mercedes progress

Mercedes would prefer F1 race win over second in constructors' standings, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/mercedes-would-prefer-f1-race-win-over-second-in-constructors-standings/10394378/, But its consistency allied to recent improvements has left it in contention to overhaul Ferrari for second place in the teams battle behind Red Bull. Mercedes is currently lying in third place in the overall standings 40 points behind its Maranello rival. The win would be proof that our car is back to fight for wins he said when asked why he felt that way. P2 could also be because the others dropped the ball and youre just scoring more points.Lewis Hamilton took another second place behind Max Verstappen as Red Bull scored a ninth consecutive victory in Mexico. We are racing for a win racing for both cars on the podium the Ferraris are behind us., The German manufacturer has endured a challenging 2022 campaign and despite having got one pole position this year is at risk of not winning a race for the first time since 2011. But its consistency allied to recent improvements has left it in contention to overhaul Ferrari for second place in the teams battle behind Red Bull. Mercedes is currently lying in third place in the overall standings 40 points behind its Maranello rival. While the runnerup slot would be a good end result to a year that started with such difficulties Wolff says that he would actually prefer it to round off the season with a victory rather than stepping up a world constructors championship position. The win would be proof that our car is back to fight for wins he said when asked why he felt that way. P2 could also be because the others dropped the ball and youre just scoring more points. Lewis Hamilton took another second place behind Max Verstappen as Red Bull scored a ninth consecutive victory in Mexico. Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images While Wolff would not be against overtaking Ferrari in the points table he says that the better judge of the teams progress is how its car is performing on track. It would definitely be some consolation because Ferrari had the quickest car at the beginning of the season he said about the runnerup spot. Finishing ahead of them would be great but again its not our main priority. The main priority is to understand the car and have a quick automobile on the track. Mercedes had two of its best chances of the year to grab that win in the recent United States and Mexican Grands Prix but tyre strategy choices compromised its chances on both occasions. However considering the scale of the problems that the team faced at the beginning of the season Wolff is happy about the level of progress made  even though there are tinges of disappointment about the Austin and Mexico chances that got away. The thing is we are racers and the moment we can kind of see it in front of us we just want to grab it he said. Therefore there is always a sense of frustration. But we have come from such a long way and here we are. We are racing for a win racing for both cars on the podium the Ferraris are behind us. So you need to stay humble and of what we achieved while still reaching for the stars. Photo by Steve Etherington  Motorsport Images Mercedes feels it has a good understanding of what went wrong with its W13 this year and what needs addressing for 2023 as it looks poised to switch concept. However Wolff says there can be no complacency that the changes that are planned will guarantee it being back at the front of the field. Im never confident he said. I always see the glass half empty. So there is nothing to really see it positive. Ive just heard nine wins in a row for Red Bull so there is no reason to be overwhelmed with finishing second and fourth. We have a long way to catch up. We have the winter. I think were doing some good development on the car. Some of the things we are finding might be bigger steps than just adding a few steps of downforce. But were giving it whatever we have and more in order to bring us back into the position to fight for a championship.
What's going on with Piastri's Alpine F1 exit?, https://the-race.com/formula-1/whats-going-on-with-piastris-alpine-f1-exit/, It is believed that having initially continued to conduct simulator work and race weekend support for Alpine at Enstone after the summer break Piastri has been stood down from those duties. However he has not been formally released from the team as this would allow him to join up with McLaren early and potentially even run in the postseason Abu Dhabi test. Alpine was not thought to be keen to facilitate that so instead Piastri has effectively been parked. In Mexico last weekend Alpine team boss Otmar Szafnauer answered carefully when asked by The Race about Piastris status but said I think our legal teams are discussing that now. Its a discussion between Oscar his team and Alpine., Oscar Piastri has been conspicuous in his absence from the public eye in Formula 1 since his rejection of Alpine in favour of a McLaren move was ratified by Formula 1s Contract Recognition Board. Piastri has been Alpines reserve driver this year as part of a programme that the Renault works team envisaged would eventually lead him to take a race seat in the future. However as Piastri and his camp did not want to go along with Alpines plan to loan him out to Williams for 2023 and 2024 a deal with McLaren was done in secret early in the summer. Alpine tried to block that move by arguing it had a valid contract with Piastri but the CRB ruled otherwise leading McLaren to formally announce Piastri as a race driver in place of Daniel Ricciardo in 2023. That came on the Dutch Grand Prix weekend in early September but Piastri has not been in the F1 paddock since he publicly rejected Alpines claim he would drive for the team in 2023 in early August. It is believed that having initially continued to conduct simulator work and race weekend support for Alpine at Enstone after the summer break Piastri has been stood down from those duties. However he has not been formally released from the team as this would allow him to join up with McLaren early and potentially even run in the postseason Abu Dhabi test. Alpine was not thought to be keen to facilitate that so instead Piastri has effectively been parked. An update on his future could come soon though. In Mexico last weekend Alpine team boss Otmar Szafnauer answered carefully when asked by The Race about Piastris status but said I think our legal teams are discussing that now. Therell be more next week. So ask me in Brazil. Doohan had more nerves chasing Alpine seat than FP1 debut Read more Jack Doohan is a logical alternative to Piastri to become Alpines reserve driver fulltime in 2023. Doohan is set to be racing in F2 again but has completed 2021 F1 car testing in private this year made his FP1 debut in Mexico and will drive again on the Friday in Abu Dhabi. Szafnauer confirmed Doohan is also among the options for a reserve role but said we havent made that decision yet. Though there is no official news yet Doohan is likely to take part in the postseason Abu Dhabi test alongside incoming Alpine driver Pierre Gasly who has been signed to take the vacant Fernando Alonso seat that the team initially wanted Piastri to fill. Reports in Spanish media have also suggested Alonso is free to drive for his new team Aston Martin in the postseason test while Gaslys AlphaTauri replacement Nyck de Vries could drive there too. The only 2023 signing not currently expected to drive for their new team in the test is Piastri although McLaren team principal Andreas Seidl would not confirm that either way in Mexico. Theres not really an update from our side he said. Its a discussion between Oscar his team and Alpine. And no updates for the moment.

Lewis Hamilton and George Russell managed to split the Red Bull cars during qualifying at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez raising hopes that they could push polesitter Max Verstappen for victory.

Asked if Mercedes should have been braver with their strategy on race day in Mexico Wolff pushed back saying No. In hindsight its always easier to judge but I think the onestop medium to hard looked like the right strategy. The car has really taken a step forward  Hamilton pleased with P2 in Mexico as Mercedes close in on Red Bull That the medium at the end held on for so long came as a surprise but hindsight is a thing. If we were to restart the race maybe we would choose a different tyre. It could have been an option to just lose more time on the medium and hang it out there for another five six laps and try to do 30 laps on the soft.

Horner: "Hugely worrying" that news of Red Bull's F1 budget cap breach leaked, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/horner-hugely-worrying-that-news-of-red-bulls-f1-budget-cap-breach-leaked/10394371/, It brought an end to the cost cap saga that first emerged over the Singapore Grand Prix weekend in late September when the first whispers emerged that Red Bull had breached the budget cap. Red Bull was only officially informed that it had breached the cost cap on the Sunday of the Japanese Grand Prix 90 minutes after Max Verstappen clinched his second world title. Reflecting on the case in Mexico following the FIAs ruling Horner said he expected followup action to investigate why news of Red Bulls breach had leaked out. The accusations made in Singapore were extremely upsetting for every single member of staff all our partners everyone involved within Red Bull said Horner. Christian Horner Team Principal Red Bull Racing in a press conference regarding the recent findings of the cost cap breach., Listen to this article Red Bull reached a settlement with the FIA over its 1.8 million breach of last years budget cap ahead of the Mexican Grand Prix arguing that it misinterpreted some of the permitted exclusions. The team was hit with a 7m fine and a 10 reduction in its permitted aerodynamic development for the next 12 months a sanction Horner called enormous and draconian. It brought an end to the cost cap saga that first emerged over the Singapore Grand Prix weekend in late September when the first whispers emerged that Red Bull had breached the budget cap. Horner hit back emphatically against the accusations when they were first made as well as calling out rivals for making defamatory claims without any official information from the FIA. Red Bull was only officially informed that it had breached the cost cap on the Sunday of the Japanese Grand Prix 90 minutes after Max Verstappen clinched his second world title. A public notice was then issued one day later. Reflecting on the case in Mexico following the FIAs ruling Horner said he expected followup action to investigate why news of Red Bulls breach had leaked out. The accusations made in Singapore were extremely upsetting for every single member of staff all our partners everyone involved within Red Bull said Horner. Obviously any form of leakage is hugely worrying. Its something that we expect to be followed up. Prior to the Accepted Breach Agreement being struck between Red Bull and the FIA a number of the teams rivals had been clear in the calls for strong action.

Horner said after the FIAs ruling that he felt Red Bull was probably due an apology from some of our rivals for some of the claims that theyve made and that the team would make no apology for the way that weve performed the way that weve acted. Horner added We do take on the chin that there are lessons to be made. Potentially mistakes have been made in our submission which with the benefit of hindsight and 2020 vision everybody can be a specialist. But there was no intent there was nothing dishonest and there was certainly no cheating involved which has been alleged in certain quarters. So I dont feel that we need to apologise. I think there are lessons that have been learned. Everybody can learn from this. Weve taken our pounding in public weve taken a very public pounding through the accusations that have been made by other teams. Our drivers have been booed at circuits. And the reputational damage that has been made by allegations has been significant. The time has come for that to stop.
F1 teams in discussions to add second factory shutdown during winter � RaceFans, https://www.racefans.net/2022/11/03/f1-teams-in-discussions-to-add-second-factory-shutdown-during-winter/, Formula 1 teams are working on introducing a winter factory shutdown similar to the current summer shutdown period for 2023. Following regulations introduced in 2013 teams have been mandated to restrict factory work for 14 days to both save costs and also relieve pressure on staff giving them time to go on holidays. The shutdown is now a core part of F1 and has become more important as the schedule has grown. But for the race team thats clocking many air miles thats positive. So if you dont force that shutdown you dont get any time off.Advert  Become a RaceFans supporter and go adfree2022 F1 season, Formula 1 teams are working on introducing a winter factory shutdown similar to the current summer shutdown period for 2023. Following regulations introduced in 2013 teams have been mandated to restrict factory work for 14 days to both save costs and also relieve pressure on staff giving them time to go on holidays. The break usually takes place in August when F1 has a gap of several weeks in the race schedule. All performancerelated work is stopped but departments or roles that focus on human resources logistics and finances and also media and marketing are allowed to continue work. The shutdown is now a core part of F1 and has become more important as the schedule has grown. In 2013 19 races were held but the 2023 F1 calendar features a recordbreaking 24 rounds. This year marks the first time since 2018 that the season has finished before December but racing will start almost two weeks earlier than usual in 2023 as the world championship begins on March 5th. The last time F1 began that early was in 2002 and only starting before March 5th twice in the 19 years before that. I think its great that the season finishes this couple of weeks earlier than in the past because everyone is really on the limiter and I think we plan to introduce a shutdown in the coming year Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff said on Saturday at last weekends Mexican Grand Prix. Advert  Become a RaceFans supporter and go adfree Not everyone is in agreement but I would very much hope that we can do that for our staff. Having this week couple of weeks more is definitely a nice welcome. But on the other side theres many people in the factory who are going to work flatout all through the Christmas and New Year. But for the race team thats clocking many air miles thats positive. Theres many of us team principals that would like to replicate what we have in the summer. At least starting at Christmas and then going into the new year for two weeks. But obviously thats still being up for discussion but there was a positive indication. For the wellbeing of the team. His counterpart at Alpine Otmar Szafnauer expects the plan will go ahead in 2023. This year it isnt happening so itll be next year he said. Christmas its one of those things that always happens on the same day every year. Its not like Thanksgiving. So I think its from the 23rd of December. So I think everyone gets Christmas Eve and Christmas day off. But that week through to the start of the year. Szafnauer also believes the change will be positive for the sport. The way I look at it is were doing more and more races. And if you dont force shutdowns people work through because its a strategic advantage. So if you remove that advantage meaning everyones got to take it off I think its good for all of us. As there is no winter shutdown at present restricting work Szafnauer says Alpines wind tunnel usually only shuts down two days for Christmas and New Years Day. We used to shut it down two days thats it. So if you dont force that shutdown you dont get any time off. Advert  Become a RaceFans supporter and go adfree 2022 F1 season
Gasly's near-ban shows absurdity of F1 penalty points system, https://the-race.com/formula-1/gaslys-near-ban-shows-absurdity-of-f1-penalty-points-system/, The everpresent desire for consistency means that theres a set tariff of penalty points for certain offences. He tipped Vettel into a spin earning a fivesecond penalty as well as two penalty points. This earned him a fivesecond penalty and two penalty points although Gasly questioned why he had been singled out for it. That could potentially create a troubling situation whereby the stewards are reluctant to issue penalty points. But his situation highlights that while the superlience penalty points system needs to exist its current form is flawed and needs reform., Formula 1s superlicence penalty points system is a good idea but poorlyimplemented as the absurd situation Pierre Gasly finds himself in  of being potentially one incident away from an automatic race ban  proves. Gasly has accrued 10 superlicence penalty points just two away from the 12point tally that automatically triggers a race ban. This will be hanging over him for the next nine races given the first of them wont be wiped until after next Mays Emilia Romagna Grand Prix. Whats more he only just evaded a ban for the upcoming Brazilian Grand Prix given the oneyear lifespan for penalty points meant he lost two earned for contact with Fernando Alonso at the first corner of last seasons Turkish Grand Prix shortly before his latest runin with the stewards. The AlphaTauri driver has committed six offences in 15 race weekends stretching back to Mays Spanish Grand Prix so you can argue he only has himself to blame. But while Gasly is overaggressive at times particularly when things arent going well and would be wellserved to rein it in at times hes hardly a danger on track. Adopted in 2014 the superlicence penalty points system was conceived to keep track of repeat offenders and create a mechanism whereby a race ban could be imposed on drivers who showed a troubling pattern of ontrack behaviour. This was a direct consequence of the crash at the start of the 2012 Belgian Grand Prix triggered by Romain Grosjean that took out among others Alonso. It was a logical move given it was felt that the number of incidents Grosjean had been involved with previously contributed to the decision to ban him for the Italian Grand Prix. There was a need for a formalised system that could set the bar for when to ban consistent troublemakers even if they didnt cause as significant an incident as the one Grosjean triggered. The stewards described the Spa crash as an extremely serious breach of the regulations which had the potential to cause injury to others and highlighted that it eliminated leading championship contenders from the race. Setting aside the troubling assertion that whether a driver you eliminate is a title contender or not is a factor in setting punishments something that thankfully has not been cited since in a stewards decision this highlighted the fact that generally a driver would only be banned for a single major incident rather than an accumulation. And that such an accumulation wasnt formally tallied up. There have been cases of bans in the past for such conduct. Famously Mika Hakkinen was banned from the 1994 Hungarian Grand Prix for causing a crash at the start of the preceding race in Germany. Eddie Irvine was given a onerace ban increased to three on appeal for the accident he triggered at Interlagos in 1994 that launched debutant Jos Verstappens Benetton into the air. In both cases there was a feeling that the drivers in question were at times too aggressive and that this contributed to the ban. Gasly driving in reckless manner exposed key F1 blindspot Read more A formalised penalty points system with 12 the threshold for an automatic ban is therefore an effective way to plot the conduct of drivers. Where F1 hasnt got it right is the way that this is implemented. The everpresent desire for consistency means that theres a set tariff of penalty points for certain offences. If you gain an advantage by exceeding track limits or are out of position at the start of the race its one point. For causing a collision or overtaking under the safety car its two points. But theres little or no wriggle room to revise the number of points upwards or downwards to better reflect the offence. Looking at Gaslys rap sheet its clear that while he is a repeat offender the idea that he could be banned for one more mishap in the next races seems ridiculous. Gaslys penalty points Spain  Causing a collision with Lance Stroll at Turn 1 2 points Aston Martin driver Stroll on soft tyres four laps younger than Gaslys mediums attempted to pass the AlphaTauri driver for 14th place on the 27th lap of the Spanish GP. As he had the use of DRS Gasly defended the inside line approaching Turn 1. Stroll was ahead at entry but as Gasly had the inside they were sidebyside at the apex. But as they exited the corner Gasly understeered into Stroll and pitched him into a spin. He was found wholly at fault for the collision although the collision was more due to a lack of grip and also hit with a fivesecond penalty. Austria  Colliding with Sebastian Vettel at Turn 4 2 points This was another case where Gasly was found wholly at fault after failing to give an Aston Martin  this time driven by Vettel  enough room when being passed around the outside. Vettel was just ahead entering the righthander so the move was on but in attempting to contest the corner Gasly braked a little late and understeered as a result. He tipped Vettel into a spin earning a fivesecond penalty as well as two penalty points. Austria  Leaving the track without reason multiple times 1 point Gasly had four laps deleted for exceeding track limits four times. That earned him a fivesecond penalty served at his second pitstop. Two of the offences were at Turn 10 one at Turn 9 and the fourth one at the first corner with stewards finding no justifiable reason for him doing so. Japan  Speeding under red flag conditions 2 points This is the most controversial of the offences and happened after he pitted at the end of lap one for a nose change having collected an advertising board spat onto the track by Carlos Sainzs accident. Gasly was deemed by the postSuzuka report into the controversy about a recovery tractor being on track in poor visibility to have driven in a reckless manner by not respecting yellow flags. Thats despite being well within the safety car delta which hadnt reset after hed visited the pits. But his penalty was for speeding once the red flags were shown about one second before he passed the tractor. He was found to have exceeded 200kmh 124mph on multiple occasionsand reached 251kmh 156mph at one point. US  Falling more than 10 car lengths behind safety car 2 points Gasly was found to have been significantly more than 10 car lengths behind the car in front under the safety car at Austin. This earned him a fivesecond penalty and two penalty points although Gasly questioned why he had been singled out for it. You arrive at 200kmh 124mph hit the brake down to 60kmh 37mph and at the same time the guy in front of you is hitting the throttle flat out and pulls the gap straight away of 150200 metres said Gasly. On the internet a lot of people are quite curious and managed to find a lot of reviews cases of drivers who did the same under the safety car without penalty. Mexico  Leaving the track and gaining an advantage 1 point Gasly passed Stroll for 15th place on the 13th lap of the Mexican GP at Turn 4. He had the inside line into the corner but locked up on the way in and forced Stroll wide. Stroll took to the runoff while Gasly also exceeded track limits. That meant he was given a penalty for leaving the track and gaining an advantage rather than forcing another driver off track. Had he been found to have committed the latter offence which would have been perfectly legitimate he would have gained an extra penalty point. This list of offences highlights several problems. Firstly speeding under the red flag certainly in the way Gasly did it should be worth more penalty points given the safety implications. That is exactly the kind of dangerous driving that the FIA needs to make completely unacceptable. But the rest of the offences are hardly ones indicative of a dangerous driver. Those at Aston Martin might disagree given three of the incidents involve green cars as the victims but they were honest mistakes in battle rather than egregious examples of incompetent or dirty driving. Gasly should take a close look at the way he handles himself in battle to cut back on such incidents and that will benefit both himself and those around him. Whats more he should avoid getting too deep into the mindset that hes being persecuted by the stewards even if his penalty for dropping too far behind the car ahead under the safety car at Austin was incredibly harsh. But he hardly needs the reality check either of a onerace ban or the threat of it. Its not impossible Gasly will get through the next nine events without picking up another two penalty points and that will certainly be his aim. If he does so you could argue the system works as the Sword of Damocles hanging over him might have forced him to modify his ontrack behaviour. But theres a good chance he will commit another offence. That could potentially create a troubling situation whereby the stewards are reluctant to issue penalty points. And as theres little room in the way this is done that might even impact the offences he gets penalised for. That doesnt mean hell not be penalised but it was notable that he was hit with an offence that came with just one penalty point for the Turn 4 incident with Stroll in Mexico rather than being done for forcing him off track which comes with two points. Brown calls for F1 stewards to be fulltime  Why arent they Read more This is connected to the wider question of F1 stewarding. The case for permanent stewards is a strong one and would make it easier for increased flexibility within the penalty points issued to differentiate between what you might call runofthemill incidents and minor errors and those that are more problematic and that collectively indicate a problematic pattern of behaviour. Its all well and good to have guidelines but creating a set menu of points for certain offences has turned what is meant to be a system to tackle those rare cases of those who cannot or will not handle themselves safely on track into an inflexible blunt instrument. If Gaslys rap sheet was more problematic there would be no such concerns. But his situation highlights that while the superlience penalty points system needs to exist its current form is flawed and needs reform.

All nine other teams  providing Logan Sargeant gets enough super license points to join Williams  have finalised their driver lineups for next year and so all eyes are on Haas with Schumacher no longer the certainty he once seemed to seal another chance alongside Kevin Magnussen. Schumacher the son of F1 legend Michael has been steady but not spectacular since making his muchanticipated debut in F1 in 2021 and has also attracted criticism from his team for his numerous crashes. One of the major pulls for the German meanwhile was that he was a Ferrari junior but the 23yearold is losing his ties to Ferrari Haas engine providers and major partners at the end of this year. Schumacher is still regarded as the favourite for the seat but with Magnussen both outscoring and outqualifying him Haas boss Guenther Steiner recently admitted it was 5050 whether he would remain with the team or not.

Hulkenberg 35 is a wellknown name in F1 and a wellrespected driver with 181 race starts to his name.

Steiner while looking for the medium to long term has also made it clear he wants his next driver to be a leader. Mick has got some experience obviously its his second year in Formula 1 he said.

Hamilton is out of contract at the end of next season when hell be 38 years old. Another twoyear deal would take him past his 40th birthday. But the seventime champion has showed no signs of slowing down in his 16th season despite the downturn in Mercedess competitiveness thats left him facing the first winless campaign of his career. Watch every practice qualifying and race of the 2022 FIA Formula One World Championship live on Kayo. New to Kayo Start your free trial now  Ahead of anticipated talks over the 202223 offseason Hamilton said he wanted to stay with Mercedes for at least two more years beyond the end of his current deal. Im not putting a limit on it to be honest he said per Autosport. Im planning to do a multiyear deal with my team. I think theres more stuff to achieve together. I just dont know how long. Mercedes boss Toto Wolff said earlier in the season that Hamilton had told him he had another five years in him and speaking at the Mexico City Grand Prix he revealed he expected talks to start after the seasonending race in Abu Dhabi. We havent started any talks he said per Crash. We want to definitely finish the season and then find some quiet time over the winter like we did last time around. Wolff also suggested a new deal would see an expansion of Hamiltons offtrack partnership with the team a key component of his previous deal which has seen team and driver commit to diversity targets within the organisation and Formula 1 more broadly. Hes much more than a driver to us now Wolff said. And although were not talking about a career end its also important to speak about his role as an ambassador for Mercedes and the many sponsors we have and the implication he can have in our wider universe. An extended Lewis Hamilton stay would be a potential spanner in the works for Daniel Ricciardo who is heavily tipped to sign for Mercedes next year as a reserve driver before attempting a fulltime comeback in 2024. Mercedes is the only one of the three frontrunning teams with a seat out of contract in 2024 with both Hamilton and teammate George Russell up for renewal before the end of next season. Candid Ricciardo reveals 2023 plans  0038 Russell is considered the future of the team and a shooin for a renewal after his strong maiden season with the team leaving Hamilton as the only potential avenue into a silver race seat though the Briton has now closed off that route with talk of a new deal. Ricciardo however insists that a decision to sign as a reserve driver wouldnt be dependent on a race seat freeing up in the following season. I dont think its relative to what others do he said. Opportunities will arise when they do. Im not banking on anyone doing something so I can find my way. I want to take the time necessary keep a little bit of distance to the sport and rebuild myself but then if something makes sense in 2024 come back with a vengeance and have some fun and hopefully race at the front. The Australian said he hopes Hamilton resigns so that he might have another chance to race him in a potential career revival. The truth is I want him to stay in the sport he said. Hes one of the greatest ever to do it and I think competing with him going wheel to wheel with him is fun. Its normally at the pointy end so I certainly wish to do that more in the future and thats where it currently lies. World champion Jenson Button has cast doubt on Ricciardos plan for a year out in light of offers from lower order teams to keep in racing in 2023. I really struggle to see him coming back to a competitive team after having a year out he told Sky Sports.

Options narrow for Ricciardo's Formula 1 future, https://www.speedcafe.com/2022/11/03/options-narrow-for-ricciardos-formula-1-future/, There look to be just two potential berths if Daniel Ricciardo is to remain in Formula 1 in 2023. Reserve Drivers perform a variety of functions for teams differing slightly for each but fundamentally offering the same services. Options for Ricciardo as a Reserve Driver are therefore limited. As you know as well we also have an agreement with other teams to share Reserve Drivers. Such a move would also be consistent with Ricciardos own statements where he asserted his future was not contingent on anyone else., There look to be just two potential berths if Daniel Ricciardo is to remain in Formula 1 in 2023. The Australian will not be in a race drive next year but is known to be interested in a Reserve Driver role should a suitable option be available. Following confirmation of Stoffel Vandoorne at Aston Martin earlier this week those potential employers have been further reduced. Reserve Drivers perform a variety of functions for teams differing slightly for each but fundamentally offering the same services. Most visible is their role in the garage listening in to the radio during sessions and taking part in debriefs thereafter. They are at the circuit as a potential shortnotice replacement and are often given time in the car during testing to bring them up to speed with the systems and fundamentals of the machine. This will often see them at events on a Friday before travelling back to base that afternoon ahead of a long night at the factory. There they work in the simulator to refine and develop car setup over a race weekend. The biggest teams will employ multiple simulator drivers with their focus on evaluating different setup options and recommending changes ahead of Saturdays Free Practice 3. Beyond that the Reserve Driver interacts with guests and is an ambassador for the team at public events speaking to the Paddock Club and so on. Typically there are two different types of drivers employed in those roles high potential youngsters who are being groomed for a possible race drive in future or race drivers whose active careers have come to an end. There are exceptions but by and large the bulk of drivers Vandoorne included fall into one of those buckets. Indeed Aston Martin is a perfect microcosm of that the team also employs Formula 2 championelect Felipe Drugovich. Vandoorne had been in a Reserve Driver role at Mercedes since 2020 coupling that with his drive for the threepointed star in Formula E. His exit along with that of Nyck de Vries who will join Scuderia AlphaTauri as race driver for 2023 leaves the AngloGerman operation without a nominated Reserve Driver for 2023. It is one of just three drivers in that position the others being McLaren and Alpine. Options for Ricciardo as a Reserve Driver are therefore limited. Sources have confirmed to Speedcafe.com that he is in discussions with a top team for an opportunity from which we can safely eliminate much of the field. We can further eliminate teams based on their stated positions with McLaren and Alpine having voiced those. Andreas Seidl Team Principal at McLaren has admitted that his team would be open to the concept but no conversations have been had on the notion. Thats a discussion we didnt have yet he said when asked of the possibility by Speedcafe.com. Its a discussion we usually have in winter. As you know as well we also have an agreement with other teams to share Reserve Drivers. Again theres absolutely no hard or bad feelings between Daniel and us and therefore in general I think its possible. At Alpine Otmar Szafnauer all but ruled out the Australians return to Enstone in a Reserve Driver capacity. We havent made that decision yet Szafnauer said of who will step into the role currently officially held by Piastri. But to be fair to Daniel we havent been talking to him about a reserve role. Given that we can logically whittle the list of potential employers to three Mercedes Red Bull and Ferrari. The latter has traditionally favoured its internal programme. It has Robert Shwartzman within its ranks already as well as the experienced Antonio Giovinazzi. In that scenario what does Ricciardo offer that the team does not already have A berth at Ferrari is therefore unlikely. Red Bull on the other hand is a possibility. It has Formula 2 race winner Liam Lawson as its nextinline youngster but when the opportunity presented to move him into a race drive Red Bull instead opted to go outside of its junior programme to recruit Nyck de Vries. Its not a huge vote of confidence in the young New Zealander who has just a handful of test outings in a Formula 1 car to his name. The squad also has Sebastien Buemi though the World Endurance Champions Formula 1 experience is somewhat dated. There is then something of a hole in the squads structure especially when one considers it has four drivers to protect Max Verstappen Sergio Perez Yuki Tsunoda and for 2023 de Vries. It would therefore make sense to bring in an experienced driver at a currently very affordable rate to mitigate that risk while also adding contemporary knowledge to the simulator programme. Of course its need is lower than Mercedes given it at least has Lawson on hand should he be needed. Given Vandoorne and de Vries have both moved on the Brackleybased operation has nobody to back up Lewis Hamilton and George Russell. It has the greatest need of a driver and of those on the market Ricciardo has the best credentials by some considerable distance. Such a move would also be consistent with Ricciardos own statements where he asserted his future was not contingent on anyone else. My future will be lets say I dont think its relative to what others do he said last month when Speedcafe.com asked about his future and Hamiltons intention to carry on beyond 2023. Opportunities will arise when they do but Im not banking on anyone doing something so I can find my way. I want to take the time necessary keep a little bit of distance to the sport and rebuild myself. But then yeah if something makes make sense in 24 come back with a vengeance and have some fun and hopefully race at the front.

But resort operators are bullish that theyll be able to fetch a high price for the week which is usually considered a soft week for visitation to the city. We think Formula One is a different animal Caesars CEO Tom Reeg said Tuesday during an investors call. The demand for that particular event is well beyond what we were expecting. As you saw the rates roll out Monday the pricing reflects that. Amanda Belarmino assistant professor at UNLVs William F. Harrah College of Hospitality said a common pricing practice is to start high and see whether demand is strong enough to sell at that price point. Its better to not leave money on the table Belarmino said. You can always discount if needed but first you can see what the market will hold. High prices on the Strip during special events are not unusual. Resorts are also likely researching pricing in other markets that have hosted onetime major events such as the Olympics Super Bowl and other Formula One races she said. Plus hotels often block off rooms for loyalty members  like MGMs promotion  which further drives up the value of any remaining available rooms. Given Formula Ones large fanbase abroad Belarmino expects there will be many international travelers who are less price sensitive because of the events uniqueness. The pricing also suggests that resorts are expecting consumers who typically dont come to Las Vegas. The prices do signal If youre not here for F1 then come some other time she said. The whole city will be geared around this event regardless of the price. If you want to see what it has to offer on a regular basis come another time when its going to be geared more towards you. But some Formula One fans will be in town as soon as this weekend for the Las Vegas Grand Prix fan festival a halfday long free event on Saturday that consists of interactive activities and live demonstrations.

Jenson Button warns Daniel Ricciardo he could be ruining his Formula One career with huge mistake, https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-11383315/Jenson-Button-warns-Daniel-Ricciardo-ruining-Formula-One-career-huge-mistake.html, Former F1 world champion Jenson Button has warned Daniel Ricciardo his plan to become a reserve driver in 2023 instead of taking a seat with a backfield team could do irreparable damage to his career. Ricciardo has been linked to a reserve position with Mercedes and Red Bull next season  a move Button believes would make it extremely difficult for him to return to drive for a top team again. But I still think it would have been a better move for him  go into a team work hard show people what you can do in a car that maybe suits you a bit more and then people forget what happened the year before. Its a tricky one and I really struggle to see him coming back to a competitive team after having a year out. And with the calendar being so long it was hard to remove yourself from what was happening in the racing., Former F1 world champion Jenson Button has warned Daniel Ricciardo his plan to become a reserve driver in 2023 instead of taking a seat with a backfield team could do irreparable damage to his career. The Australian has been dropped by McLaren after failing to find form with the famous English outfit and recently exclusively revealed to Daily Mail that he wants a little distance from the sport so he can rebuild himself after two years of shocking results. Ricciardo has been linked to a reserve position with Mercedes and Red Bull next season  a move Button believes would make it extremely difficult for him to return to drive for a top team again. The struggling Aussie star has confessed he wants to put some space between himself and the sport next year as hes been connected to a reserve role with Mercedes or Red Bull Exworld champ Jenson Button pictured with wife Brittny believes stepping back from the starting grid will make it very hard for Ricciardo to return to driving for a top team I guess he didnt want to drop too far down the grid and work with a team thats more towards the rear because its difficult for a driver coming from a team that is almost wining races at times to suddenly know youre fighting for points Button said on Sky Sports. It is tough. But I still think it would have been a better move for him  go into a team work hard show people what you can do in a car that maybe suits you a bit more and then people forget what happened the year before. But sitting out People just remember what happened last year. Its a tricky one and I really struggle to see him coming back to a competitive team after having a year out. Ricciardos desire to put some distance between himself and the sport stems from how badly hes been affected by his struggles this season and last. Despite a thrilling run to seventh in the Mexico Grand Prix that earned him Driver of the Day honours Ricciardo sits a lowly 12th in this years drivers standings with just 29 points to his name  far behind teammate Lando Norris whos coming seventh with 109. Ricciardo pictured at the Mexico Grand Prix had to speak to a psychologist last year as his shocking run of form at McLaren took its toll My confidence was being eaten away driving a car that wouldnt dance with me and would bite back Ricciardo told Daily Mail. Whenever we thought we would found a solution along would come another set of challenges. When you put so much into something and it doesnt work out there is sadness. It gets to you. Last year it affected me a little bit too much. I wouldnt be my usual bubbly self. I would be reluctant if someone said lets go out for dinner. I would need some cajoling. I let it get to me. I started to speak to a psychologist last year  the most challenging year I have had. Racing is very much results driven and dictates your Sunday happiness. I was neglecting friendships and thought it would be good to talk to someone to make sure the two sides of my life didnt cross over. Its like all things you need perspective. And with the calendar being so long it was hard to remove yourself from what was happening in the racing.
F1 News: Haas hit the jackpot with new seven-figure sponsorship, https://www.si.com/fannation/racing/f1briefings/news/f1-news-haas-hit-the-jackpot-with-new-seven-figure-sponsorship-jd22, Haas F1 Team recently announced MoneyGram as its new title sponsor for the 2023 season confirming a multiyear deal with the American company. Since joining Formula 1 in 2016 Haass financial struggles have been welldocumented with the US team failing to match the expenditure of rival teams. However new details have emerged regarding the true extent of the financial injection Haas will receive. The partnerships success will determine whether this sponsorship continues beyond three years but this agreement will be very lucrative for Haas regardless. The team principal even commented that MoneyGram being an American company contributed to its eventual selection as Haass title sponsor., Haas F1 Team recently announced MoneyGram as its new title sponsor for the 2023 season confirming a multiyear deal with the American company. Since joining Formula 1 in 2016 Haass financial struggles have been welldocumented with the US team failing to match the expenditure of rival teams. The introduction of the budget cap has benefited Haas but the team has still lacked the funds to maximise its spending and reach the cap since its introduction. Guenther Steiner confirmed after the announcement of Haass partnership with MoneyGram that the team will be able to reach the budget cap with this new financial support. However new details have emerged regarding the true extent of the financial injection Haas will receive. According to racingnews365 Haas will receive an estimated 20 million per season from MoneyGram over three years. The partnerships success will determine whether this sponsorship continues beyond three years but this agreement will be very lucrative for Haas regardless. After a series of quite embarrassing sponsorship deals Rich Energy Uralkali Haas looks to have secured a muchneeded partner for the foreseeable future. Considering that Haas is now a competitive outfit in F1s midfield there can be little doubt that many sponsors will look to collaborate and work with the team moving forward. Whilst Haas could have certainly done a better job at securing sponsors previously there is now little excuse not to capitalise on the abundance of available opportunities. The last few years have also seen Formula 1 experience significant growth in the American market which will surely aid Haas in its quest to acquire new partners. Guenther Steiner has already mentioned that Haas intends to focus on working with more US sponsors in the future something the team has been hesitant to prioritise in previous seasons. The team principal even commented that MoneyGram being an American company contributed to its eventual selection as Haass title sponsor. With Ferrari no longer influencing Haass driver lineup the team is becoming increasingly independent in Formula 1.
Mika Hakkinen agrees with Toto Wolff on Red Bull's F1 cost cap punishment, https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/hakkinen-wolff-red-bull-punishment-28394694, Mercedes team principal Wolff gave a specific reason why his team will not risk breaking cost cap rules in the future and F1 champion Hakkinen believes the Austrian made a good pointDouble Formula 1 world champion Mika Hakkinen does not believe any team will be willing to break cost cap rules after Red Bull were slapped with a significant punishment. Red Bull overspent during the 2021 season and agreed not to fight the penalty imposed by the FIA. That point of view has been backed up by Hakkinen who feels the cost cap rules still have teeth. The first thing to say is that I am glad this matter is now closed and the FIAs penalty accepted by Red Bull the Finn wrote in his Unibet column. Red Bulls penalty for the minor overspend is still significant., Mercedes team principal Wolff gave a specific reason why his team will not risk breaking cost cap rules in the future and F1 champion Hakkinen believes the Austrian made a good point Double Formula 1 world champion Mika Hakkinen does not believe any team will be willing to break cost cap rules after Red Bull were slapped with a significant punishment. Red Bull overspent during the 2021 season and agreed not to fight the penalty imposed by the FIA. The team was fined 6m and will lose 10 of their aerodynamic testing time over the next 12 months as punishment for breaching budget cap regulations. The punishment divided opinion among others as some felt justice had been served and other worried that it might not be enough to prevent others from willingly breaking the rules in the future now a precedent has been set. Asked for his opinion by Mirror Sport team boss Christian Horner said it is a strong deterrent adding  Anyone who diminishes that penalty doesnt know what theyre talking about. Reacting to the punishment Mercedes chief Toto Wolff explained that the threat of reputational damage would be enough to deter his team from willingly overspending. Whatever team you are youre responsible for representing a brand your employees and your partners and thats why for us it wouldnt be something they would do said the Austrian. That point of view has been backed up by Hakkinen who feels the cost cap rules still have teeth. The first thing to say is that I am glad this matter is now closed and the FIAs penalty accepted by Red Bull the Finn wrote in his Unibet column. With technical and sporting regulations you generally have a clear decision for example if the car is under the weight limit or a driver goes outside the track limits but with the financial regulations there was always likely to be a grey area. Image Formula 1 via Getty Images Formula 1 via Getty Images I think that is why everyone accepted two levels to breaking the budget cap  a minor or major overspend. The FIA recognised that there could be various levels of overspend and reasons for doing so. Red Bulls penalty for the minor overspend is still significant. Far more than the financial or aerodynamic penalty it has been an uncomfortable experience for the team. The good thing is that no team will want to risk repeating this next year so although it has been a very difficult and controversial moment for Red Bull I believe it will benefit F1 in the long term because every team boss will be determined not to have this kind of negative publicity in future. Speaking about the criticism he and his team faced in the wake of the cost cap breach Horner explained We have taken a public pounding from the accusations that other teams have made. Weve had our drivers booed at circuits. The reputational damage has been significant and the time for that to stop is now and move on.

Piero Ferrari and Binotto lead tributes to legendary F1 engineer Forghieri, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/piero-ferrari-and-binotto-lead-tributes-to-legendary-f1-engineer-forghieri/10394299/, On the teams website Piero Ferrari recalled mediating between his father and Forghieri. While Mauro Forghieri taken on a few years earlier was next door. We mourn the passing of Mauro Forghieri one of the most amazing people to have worked here. Current head of GT sporting activities Antonello Coletta said Mauro Forghieri played a key role in fuelling the history of Ferrari. Enzo Ferrari claimed to be an agitator of men and I think we can say that Forghieri was an agitator of ideas., Forghieri is widely regarded as one of the key players in the history of Scuderia Ferrari having been a team manager and both a chassis and engine designer with the Maranello outfit. His stint with the company lasted from 1959 to 1987 encompassing some of its most memorable successes. He is credited with an involvement in 54 race wins and 11 world championships. On the teams website Piero Ferrari recalled mediating between his father and Forghieri. When I joined the company in 1965 I shared an office with Cavalier Giberti Ferraris first employee he said. While Mauro Forghieri taken on a few years earlier was next door. We were therefore separated by 10 years of age and a window. In fact we saw each other all day every day. Forghieri was energetic and passionate about everything he did. He was sanguine and I recall that in many of those interminable meetings at the Gestione Sportiva that started in the evening and went on into the night I mediated between him and my father. I know my father appreciated his tireless work ethic and he knew that any mistakes only came about through an attempt to do something better and to look ahead. We have lost a part of our history a man who gave a great deal to Ferrari and to the world of racing in general. Chris Amon Ferrari 312 Mauro Forghieri chief engineer Ferrari founder and owner Enzo Ferrari Photo by Motorsport Images Binotto noted that Forghieri was a great motivator with a charismatic personality. Today is a very sad day for everyone at Scuderia Ferrari he said. We mourn the passing of Mauro Forghieri one of the most amazing people to have worked here. He was appointed as team manager at the age of 27 and with his brilliant insights he was one of the last allround engineers in the car world. I met him on various occasions and each time was something special. He was to the end a truly charismatic individual. His revolutionary ideas together with his vibrant nature his abilities as a great motivator meant he played a very important role in some of the most significant moments of Ferraris history and he did more than most to fuel the Prancing Horse legend. We will all miss him. Forghieri was also very much involved in Ferraris sportscar racing programme which was shelved in the early 1970s. Current head of GT sporting activities Antonello Coletta said Mauro Forghieri played a key role in fuelling the history of Ferrari. Enzo Ferrari claimed to be an agitator of men and I think we can say that Forghieri was an agitator of ideas. He was a brilliant innovator capable of coming up with technical solutions that eluded most of the engineers of his day. He was a designer who went beyond his defined role who became a benchmark and a source of inspiration for everyone who worked with him. He was an eclectic designer and his curiosity and desire to push the boundaries sealed his place in the history of Ferrari and motorsport in general.
OBITUARY: Mauro Forghieri technical genius behind some of Formula 1’s greatest Ferraris remembered, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.obituary-mauro-forghieri-technical-genius-behind-some-of-formula-1s-greatest.67IR5vwYq73vG9mhaKYd3N.html, Mauro Forghieri who has died at 87 found himself thrust into the F1 limelight in 1962 at the tender age of 26. He later worked directly for Alfa and Mauro went to school in Milan. He himself had gatecrashed some Ferrari lunches where driver Clemente Biondetti a fourtime Mille Miglia winner had become his hero. His was thus an allround education in the racing world learning at the feet of the spirited technical director Carlo Chiti. There was excitement when Ayrton Senna tested the engine for McLaren and was impressed with it as a potential replacement for the Honda V12 engine they were due to lose for 1993., Mauro Forghieri who has died at 87 found himself thrust into the F1 limelight in 1962 at the tender age of 26. His grandfather Anselmo was a passionate and committed socialist who was a friend of Mussolini and Sandro Pertini the socialist politician who went on to become the president of Italy from 1978 to 1985. His father Reclus trained at the Fermo Corni Technical Industrial Institute and worked with Enzo Ferrari in 1937 and 38 in Milan during the conception of the Alfa Romeo 158 which went on to claim the first two official Drivers World Championships in 1950 and 51. He later worked directly for Alfa and Mauro went to school in Milan. Separated by the war the Forghieri family was reunited when hostilities ceased and after working for a while on classic cars while living between Nice and Monaco on the French Riviera Reclus returned to Modena and went to work as a toolmaker at Ferrari where he remained until 1973. READ MORE Under the bodywork of the Ferrari 312B3 Mauro who shared his grandfathers and fathers penchant for passionate selfexpression was raised there then educated at Bologna University where he graduated in 1959 with a doctorate in mechanical engineering. He revealed that his father had been only slightly interested in racing as the Mille Miglia had actually passed by their front door. He himself had gatecrashed some Ferrari lunches where driver Clemente Biondetti a fourtime Mille Miglia winner had become his hero. He had done an internship at Ferrari in 1957 but his knowledge of Formula 1 was minimal and after an initial leaning towards teaching he then considered emigrating to California to work for a company making aircraft turbine engines. But Enzo Ferrari himself was insistent that he should follow his father into the company. Soon he became involved in myriad engineering projects learning not just about engines but gearboxes chassis and suspension. His was thus an allround education in the racing world learning at the feet of the spirited technical director Carlo Chiti. Forghieri back to camera stayed with Ferrari after an exodus of personnel including Carlo Chiti L  who designed the Sharknose cars The big break came on October 30 1961. At that time Ferrari had won the World Championship with Phil Hill and the Sharknose 156. In a reverse palace coup Chiti and team manager Romolo Tavoni and most of the design staff had quit. Tired of Laura Ferrari Enzos wifes endless meddling they had formed Automobili Turismo e Sport ATS in Sasso Marconi in Bologna with financial backing from industrialists Jaime Ortiz Patino Giorgio Billi and Count Giovanni Volpi. Hill went with them and when the venture failed his career was left in ruins. It was a Monday Forghieri recalled. My life was turned around completely. Ferrari called me and got straight to the point. He said From this moment on you are responsible for all the motor sport activity and testing. I was amazed agog but I was able to maintain a certain lucidity he admitted. But as he pointed out immediately to Il Commendatore he was only 26 and had zero experience. READ MORE Legendary Ferrari engineer Mauro Forghieri passes away aged 87 Moreover while Ferrari had gained the jump on the dominant British teams Lotus Cooper and BRM when they refused initially to accept that the new 1.5litre formula really would happen in 1961 by 1962 with new V8 engines and in Lotuss case the groundbreaking bathtub monocoque chassis they had caught up and exposed Ferraris inherent weaknesses. His was thus a Herculean task but by 1963 he had persuaded Ferrari to employ John Surtees whose talent together with Chris Amons in later years he believed to be the equal of Jim Clarks. By 1964 Surtees had taken Ferrari to the Drivers and Constructors World Championships and though the subsequent series of 312 cars were necessarily born around an elderly 3litre V12 sportcar engine from 1966 and only won three races between that year and 1969 the flat12 engine he commissioned Franco Rocchi Franco to create for 1970 led to a rebirth when installed in his own 312B chassis. Forghieri with the Daytonawinning 330 P4 one of the revered P series of Scuderia sports cars Jacky Ickx narrowly lost out on the title that year but by 1974 Ferrari was back on track with Niki Lauda and Clay Regazzoni winning races. Lauda went on to win Drivers titles in 1975 and 77 after missing out narrowly to James Hunt in 1976 and Ferrari won the Constructors titles in all three years. He designed the transversal transmission that helped to create the cars excellent weight distribution from 1975 onwards. Jody Scheckter aided by Gilles Villeneuve added two more titles in 1979 and the turbocharged 126 cars of 1982 and 83 likewise won Constructors laurels as British designer Harvey Postlethwaite was engaged to work alongside Forghieri. Polemics were always a crucial part of Ferrari given the passionate support of the tifosi and the aggression of an Italian media that was intolerant of anything other than success. Ferrari scored but a single victory in 1984 and by 1985 the politics within the team obliged Ferrari to move Mauro sideways as face was saved by appointing him director of Ferraris advanced research office and Harvey was left in sole charge of F1 engineering. Mauro endured this new regime working from January 1985 on the 408 4RM concept car until it was completed in May 1987 whereupon he finally left the Scuderia to take on the role of technical director of the newly formed Lamborghini Engineering. Lamborghini had been bought by Chryslers Lee Iacocca that year and he wanted an F1 engine to help sell its roadgoing supercars. Company boss Daniele Audetto had worked with Forghieri while he was team manager at Ferrari and they worked well together as Mauro designed a normallyaspirated V12 engine for the new 3.5litre formula which came into force for 1989. It would power a Lola entered by Gerard Larrousses team. The engine was shown to the media in April 1988 and ran for the first time at Dijon in December in a Larrousse Lola driven by Philippe Alliot. It showed potential though the best result was just a sixth for Alliot in the Spanish GP. The engine was used by Larrousse and Lola for 1990 the best results being a thirdplaced podium for Aguri Suzuki for the former in Japan plus sixths in Britain and Spain and fifth in Hungary and sixth in Canada for Derek Warwick for the latter. Forghieri who designed the innovative 312 T series with Lauda L Agreement was reached for Lamborghini Engineering to design a bespoke car powered by the V12 engine for Mexican businessman Fernando Gonzalez Lunas new team for 1991. Forghieri oversaw the project as Mario Tolentino drew the Glas 001 but when Luna disappeared in June 1990 and the nascent team succumbed Audetto convinced Italian financier Carlo Patrucco to take over the project and Mauro was appointed technical director of the new Modena Teams Lambo 291. The arrangement proved shortlived and he was back at Lamborghini Engineering developing the V12 further until he was replaced by Mike Rice after a shakeup. There was excitement when Ayrton Senna tested the engine for McLaren and was impressed with it as a potential replacement for the Honda V12 engine they were due to lose for 1993. In the end however that deal came to nothing. Mauro designed an electric minivan for Enel in 1992 and was appointed technical director of Bugatti Automobili where he developed the EB110 and 112 models before leaving to found Oral Engineering in Modena with Franco Antoniazzi and Sergio Lugli early in 1995. His work there embraced the design research and development of automobile motorcycle marine and gokart engines for clients such as BMW Bugatti and Aprilia and turning the Ferrari Pinin concept car into a pukka roadworthy vehicle. Later he was chief engineer in the mid2000s on the Project 1221 MF1 sports car. He was also one of the technical experts called to court during the official investigation into the death of Ayrton Senna at Imola on May 1 that year. Forghieri oversaw the creation of the Bugatti EB110

Speaking to selected media including Motorsport.com Hamilton said We are going to do another deal. Were going to sit down and were going to discuss it in these next couple of months I would say.

We havent started having talks explained Wolff. We want to definitely finish the season and then find some quiet time over the winter like we have done last time around that literally started in the winter holidays and lasted over two months. We havent done that. But hes much more than a driver to us now. Although were not talking about a career end its also important to speak about his role as an ambassador for Mercedes and the many sponsors that we have and the implication he can have in our wider audience.

New to Kayo Start your free trial now  The 19yearold has impressed in his standout rookie Formula 2 campaign this season sitting fourth in the championship with three wins including in the feature race at SpaFrancorchamps. He could finish in the top three depending on results at the final round of the year. He was briefly considered for a sudden elevation to Formula 1 for next season when both Fernando Alonso and Oscar Piastri defected from the team during the midseason break but Alpine instead signed Pierre Gasly giving Doohan a second campaign in Formula 2 to hone his craft. Another practice session is also on his horizon at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix as part of the teams efforts to better embed him into its grand prix operation and Doohan said it was part of the plan to ready him for his eventual F1 debut. Im just trying to prepare myself as much as possible and kind of maximise what I can do  learn as much from the team and try and really embed myself with the team so if the opportunity does arise to get in the car or become a fulltime driver Im more than ready he told select media including Fox Sports. Thats what Alpine are helping me to do and really thats the plan. Im part of their future which Im a very thankful for. This is the plan to obviously win Formula 2 next year as well as be in the best possible position to see what the future holds. NASCAR driver uses wall to advantage  0126 Its a role similar to that held by Piastri before he split with the team. That process remains ongoing with McLaren so far signalling that it doesnt expect to get access to the Australian until next year. But despite Piastri being shuffled towards the exit Doohan said he hadnt yet been given his compatriots reservedriver status for this season or next. I havent had any clarification on that he said. An Alpine spokesperson added that an announcement on reserve drivers would be made in due course. Regardless of the formalities theres no doubt Doohans path to Formula 1 has opened dramatically in the last 12 months. His decision at the end of last year to switch to the Alpine program from Red Bulls junior academy  which is much celebrated but held at arms length from Red Bull Racing  has paid dividends in terms of his connectedness to a Formula 1 team and the active development hes receiving. Its also put him in a prime position to capitalise from the turmoil in Alpines driver roster elevating him to the top of the junior program just as the best of his Formula 2 results started to flow. Verstappen claims another win Ric 7th  0235 Asked whether he could see his route into Formula 1 Doohan said he was confident. For sure I see that he said. The possibility is there. I just need to obviously keep on working doing the best that I possibly can and keep working with Alpine because theyve been honestly amazing to me. Im really proud to be part of the team and I hope to be a part of their future and in the long plan because from just working with the team in the past two events and my short periods while in F2 we have amazing potential here. Good things are 100 per cent coming so to be part of it in the future should be really cool. Theyve helped me so much from joining the academy in January to doing my first FP1 session now in October so theyre looking after me really well. I cant wait to repay the favour hopefully in years to come.

Will Red Bull's punishment deter future F1 cost cap breaches?, https://www.crash.net/f1/feature/1016171/1/will-red-bull-s-punishment-deter-future-f1-cost-cap-breaches, Red Bull have been fined 7m and docked 10 percent of their aerodynamic testing time for the next 12 months after their submitted accounts were found to be 1.6 percent over the 145m spending limit set during Max Verstappens titlewinning 2021 campaign. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner described a 10 percent aero research reduction for an 0.37 overspend as draconian but said his team begrudgingly accepted the sanction for the good of the sport. Asked whether the punishment was strong enough to prevent Mercedes from purposely committing a breach in future Toto Wolff argued the reputational damage Red Bull sustained was a big enough deterrent. Mike Krack whose Aston Martin team were fined 450000 after striking their own ABA for procedural infringements of the cost cap insists the FIA must be trusted to govern fairly and properly. This is for the FIA to judge Krack said when asked if he thinks the penalty strengthens the budget cap., Red Bull have been fined 7m and docked 10 percent of their aerodynamic testing time for the next 12 months after their submitted accounts were found to be 1.6 percent over the 145m spending limit set during Max Verstappens titlewinning 2021 campaign. The FIA ruled there were 13 areas where Red Bull had wrongly excluded costs which amounted to an overspend of 1.8m however F1s governing body acknowledged the team would have exceeded the cap by only 432652 had they not omitted a tax credit in their submission. Is Hamilton No Longer the Best Wet Weather Driver Video of Is Hamilton No Longer the Best Wet Weather Driver Red Bull team principal Christian Horner described a 10 percent aero research reduction for an 0.37 overspend as draconian but said his team begrudgingly accepted the sanction for the good of the sport. With rivals including Ferrari and McLaren publicly expressing their displeasure at the size of the penalty questions were raised as to whether the FIAs verdict would draw a line under the case or open up a new can of worms. Asked whether the punishment was strong enough to prevent Mercedes from purposely committing a breach in future Toto Wolff argued the reputational damage Red Bull sustained was a big enough deterrent. I think what you see is that beyond the sporting penalty and the financial fine theres also a reputational damage and in a world of transparency and good governance thats just not on anymore Wolff told Sky Sports. And compliancewise in whatever team you are youre responsible for representing a brand your employees your partners and thats why for us it wouldnt be a business case. For Ferrari question marks still remain. Ferrari racing director Laurent Mekies was sceptical about Horners claims and the overall impact of the penalty suggesting Red Bulls Accepted Breach Agreement with the FIA simply encourages money that could have been detracted from their budget to be spent elsewhere. We at Ferrari do not understand how the 10 reduction of the ATA can correspond to the same amount of lap time Mekies told Sky Sports Italia. Furthermore there is another problem in that since there is no budget cap reduction in the penalty the basic effect is to push the competitor to spend the money elsewhere. It has total freedom to use the money it can no longer spend on use of the wind tunnel and CFD due to the 10 reduction on reducing the weight of the car or who knows what else. Our concern is that the combination of these two factors means the real effect of the penalty is very limited. Time to close the chapter Other teams believe it is the end of the matter  for now at least. Mike Krack whose Aston Martin team were fined 450000 after striking their own ABA for procedural infringements of the cost cap insists the FIA must be trusted to govern fairly and properly. This is for the FIA to judge Krack said when asked if he thinks the penalty strengthens the budget cap. I think there has been enough polemics around the whole topic about how big the fine has to be. I think we should now look to the front and not back and discuss who had which fine and if it was large enough or not. The FIA is in charge of doing that. We have to trust that they do that correctly and respect that. Despite dismissing Red Bulls claim that their penalty could cost them up to half a second in laptime next season Alfa Romeo team principal Fred Vasseur echoed Wolffs view that brand damage alone would stop teams from making the same mistake. The biggest punishment for a team is to accept that they were overspending in terms of image and we dont have to underestimate this one  for your employees for your sponsors and so on Vasseur explained. I think its very good to reach the end of the discussion to have a clear picture of the FIA to have a clear decision from the FIA to have an agreement from the team also this will help to close the chapter. Then if you speak about technical or sporting decisions or penalties its a bit different for me because Im not sure we are making half a second with 10 per cent of your allocation or we are very stupid. Horner highlighted the matter could have dragged on for months had Red Bull challenged the FIA and decided to take things as far as the FIAs International Court of Appeal. Concerns have also been raised about how long the auditing process took as well as the prospect for F1 to be facing a case of deja vu when the results of teams spending for 2022 are revealed. To avoid another potential cost cap saga this time next year teams have urged F1 and the FIA to find a way of speeding up the process to ensure there is no controversy hanging over the outcome of the previous seasons championship. I think we should close this chapter now for 2021 but the FIA has to control the teams from the very beginning onwards from January onwards which is what I said already two years ago when we discussed this cost cap story said AlphaTauri team principal Franz Tost. Why Because the regulation is very very complicated and there is room for different interpretations and therefore the teams need some support and the FIA has to send people to the teams to check all this because its bad for the image of Formula 1 for the teams whatever if one year afterwards we discuss about overspending or whatever. This has to be done and sorted out during the season that at the end of the season everything is finalised and the technical regulations are also possible why shouldnt it be possible in the financial regulations. We have a meeting every Tuesday. I know every Tuesday how much we are below the cost cap and how we have to react and I think this should be the F1 standard that at the end of the season we know who won the championship and that this team was below the cost cap and everything has been sorted out.
PALMER: Could Mercedes have beaten Verstappen in Mexico City with bolder calls from the pit wall?, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.palmer-could-mercedes-have-beaten-a-flawless-verstappen-in-mexico-city.12yaYeWa0ZnfzQjzYLfZy6.html, Barely anybody has been able to beat Max and Red Bull on merit this season and it was the case again in Mexico on Sunday. Mercedes arrived in Mexico in buoyant mood. But Mexico City is a circuit where the polesitter has had an erratic time in the past so the thought of a Mercedes victory  or at least an entertaining fight for the win  seemed plausible on Saturday evening. It certainly would have made it a closer fight though had Hamilton been able to clear Perez quickly  no guarantee given Red Bulls topend speed advantage. Switching him to softs would likely have given Mercedes a double podium and by staying out there was the added benefit of pitting during a potential Safety Car., Max Verstappen has been nothing short of sensational this season and deservedly notched up his 14th win of the season ensuring his domination of 2022 will go down in the history books. Nobody has scored more wins in a single campaign in Formula 1. His dominance is underlined by the fact that there are still two races remaining to bolster that stat. Barely anybody has been able to beat Max and Red Bull on merit this season and it was the case again in Mexico on Sunday. But could Mercedes have won it Mercedes arrived in Mexico in buoyant mood. The thin air caused by the extreme altitude of Mexico City meant that their drag deficit which has been hampering their straightline speed this year was reduced. POWER RANKINGS Who tops the charts after the Mexico City Grand Prix Mercedes enjoyed the highaltitude Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez Verstappen produced a sublime lap in qualifying to clinch pole position doing what neither Mercedes driver could manage  putting three best sectors together on a single lap. Hamilton was compromised by abusing track limits on his first Q3 effort which naturally meant he had to be slightly more cautious on his second as he had no banker lap. Russell meanwhile was neckandneck with Verstappen heading into the final sector before sliding off wide at Turn 12 and aborting the lap. But Mexico City is a circuit where the polesitter has had an erratic time in the past so the thought of a Mercedes victory  or at least an entertaining fight for the win  seemed plausible on Saturday evening. No polesitter at the previous three Mexican Grands Prix had even managed to make the podium. READ MORE In hindsight its always easier  Wolff defends Mercedes Mexico strategy as wait for 2022 win goes on Inevitably that changed with the dominant Dutchman on pole commanding a lightstoflag victory as weve come to expect this year. What we didnt expect was Mercedes challenge wilting after they were talking up their chances prerace and have been so close to victory at other circuits where their pace seemed less competitive. This came down predominantly to their strategy and more specifically their use of the hard tyre in the Grand Prix. Jolyon Palmers Analysis Who made the right choices in Mexico City The hard tyre wasnt a good tyre as evidenced by Daniel Ricciardo who used the soft to charge his way past the midfielders who had opted for it earlier on. Ricciardo was even fast enough to overcome the deserved 10second penalty that he received for taking Tsunoda off at Turn 6 in his botched attempt. Given Ricciardo made effectively 20 seconds on Lando Norris  on the soft tyre versus the hard tyre in the second stint  its plausible that a similar choice for Mercedes could have given Hamilton a chance of fighting Verstappen given his 15second deficit in the end. The decision for Hamilton was a tough call for Mercedes who would have lost track position to Perez had they waited for the soft tyre rather than boxing for hards earlier on. It was an understandable choice and in all likelihood wouldnt have changed the outcome for their seventime champion. READ MORE The design secrets that set Red Bulls RB18 apart from its F1 rivals Hamilton unlike Norris was lapping in clear air and thus the comparison to Ricciardos pace is probably too generous. It certainly would have made it a closer fight though had Hamilton been able to clear Perez quickly  no guarantee given Red Bulls topend speed advantage. The call for Russell was the bigger error from Mercedes in my opinion. Russell matched the pace of Hamilton throughout the Mexican weekend and had nothing to lose by doing something different as he was already fourth in a fourcar race. Switching him to softs would likely have given Mercedes a double podium and by staying out there was the added benefit of pitting during a potential Safety Car. Mercedes could have had a double podium with a mediumsoft strategy George was calling for it from the cockpit as well but Mercedes were ultimately cautious with strategy in Mexico  and thats not how they will be able to challenge the mighty VerstappenRed Bull partnership in 2022. Credit should go to Verstappen for the way he absorbed the early pressure and then optimised his own strategy by ensuring he had plenty of life in the medium tyre. Mexico has always been a low energy track thats kind on tyres. Red Bull used that to their full advantage but it still takes the driver to do the job from the cockpit as well. Verstappen is looking the complete package right now and while his victory stats show the extent of his dominance this season they dont display the full array of his skillset that weve witnessed. READ MORE Hes been perfect  Horner full of praise after Verstappens recordbreaking victory Verstappen has been almost perfect in 2022 as underlined by his record 14th victory of the season
F1 set to abandon plan to lower tyre blanket temperatures for 2023, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/f1-set-to-abandon-plan-to-lower-tyre-blanket-temperatures-for-2023/10393961/, Listen to this articleThe move has long been planned as part of an additional change for 2024 where tyre blanket use is set to be totally abandoned within the championships sustainability drive. Because this is the period of blanket that is using a lot more energy  its like the oven at home he continued. And to propose a full 2023 strategy of tyre blanket heating two hours at 70C. Thats the plan for the moment.It is understood that Pirelli has also presented its 2023 tyre blanket idea to the FIA and the F1 organisation and has received positive feedback to the new approach rather than lowering the blanket temperature to 50C. Isola also suggested that the inevent tyre testing conducted in Austin and Mexico could return at certain events next year., Listen to this article The move has long been planned as part of an additional change for 2024 where tyre blanket use is set to be totally abandoned within the championships sustainability drive. But lowering tyre blanket temperature alone has proved to be unpopular with the drivers and has been in the headlines in particular since the recent US Grand Prix where the first of two inevent 2023 tyre tests took place before the second occurred in Mexico last weekend. Red Bulls world champion Max Verstappen said the move would lead to a lot of crashes while McLarens Lando Norris felt everyones going to shunt their car at some point. In response to the drivers comments after the Austin test Pirelli conducted an experiment for the Mexico test where the tyres were heated in blankets at 70C but only for two hours and not the usual three which would have remained the operation for the 50C limit being brought in. Pirelli apparently discovered that this change actually used less energy overall and would soothe the drivers concerns at the same time. Pirelli motorsport boss Mario Isola then explained to Motorsport.com that while for 2024 the plan is still not to have a blanket for next year the investigation of our analysis said that if you warm the tyres at 70C for two hours and not three hours you save more energy than the blankets at 50C for three hours. Because this is the period of blanket that is using a lot more energy  its like the oven at home he continued. So if you switch it on you have a first phase where you go up to the required temperature and then its stabilised. But to keep the temperature at the level you want you need to use energy. So thats the point. Tyre heating system Ferrari F175 Charles Leclerc Carlos Sainz Photo by Erik Junius Isola presented Pirellis findings to the drivers in their Mexico City GP postFP2 regular briefing. He said that the drivers agreed they would prefer F1 to adopt the approach of heating the tyres hotter for a shorter period. For me its a sensible solution said Isola. As I said we also save more energy. Now we have to analyse all the data from the heating approach ahead of the Mexico test because clearly the test was only last Friday and we didnt have a lot of time to analyse the data. The rest of the plan is to find the five compounds we want to homologate for 2023. Then bring the final version of the tyres to Abu Dhabi for the postseason test so the drivers can test the final range of compounds. And to propose a full 2023 strategy of tyre blanket heating two hours at 70C. Thats the plan for the moment. It is understood that Pirelli has also presented its 2023 tyre blanket idea to the FIA and the F1 organisation and has received positive feedback to the new approach rather than lowering the blanket temperature to 50C. Isola also suggested that the inevent tyre testing conducted in Austin and Mexico could return at certain events next year. These are useful only for Pirelli getting data on how the compounds it is producing are working rather than building the specific construction of the tyres  that requires longer private test events as cars need their setups adjusted to get the right data. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes W13 Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images What they call in competition test is an option for the future said Isola. Especially next year we have 24 races we have a second part of the season with a lot of overseas events. We know how much teams and team personnel are stressed because they have to travel a lot and so on. So if we have this option we dont oblige the teams to stay out for another 23 days for our tyre testing. And we can use this in a second part of the season. As the 2024 tyre blanket ban plan is remaining at this stage it would be logical to expect that either Pirelli would have to produce all new tyre constructions for that year or the teams would have to make substantial changes to their designs to improve earlystint tyre warm up. There were suggestions from some engineers that on this factor too the impact of the proposed reduction to 50C tyre blanket heating had only been fully revealed very late in the car design process for 2023 which also added to the opposition to that plan being utilised.
Alpine: Alonso F1 engine failures are "luck of the draw", https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/alpine-alonso-f1-engine-failures-are-luck-of-the-draw/10394180/, After the race Alonso reflected on how many engine problems he has had in 2022 and how they always seemed to happen to his car. So again this was an engine issue said Szafnauer when asked why there was a pattern. And we dont have the same people preparing an Esteban engine or a Fernando engine they all mix around. Esteban in the latter half of the race started losing water pressure so we had to lift and coast it he explained. But we dont know the root cause., Listen to this article The Spaniard was forced to retire from last weekends race on the 64th lap with a cylinder issue while running in seventh place. The retirement cost Alpine priceless points in its battle with McLaren for fourth in the F1 world championship. After the race Alonso reflected on how many engine problems he has had in 2022 and how they always seemed to happen to his car. So again this was an engine issue said Szafnauer when asked why there was a pattern. And we dont have the same people preparing an Esteban engine or a Fernando engine they all mix around. The probability of this happening isnt zero. So it can happen. But it is lower to always to have it on one side or the other. But when I was at Honda I cant remember how many engine failures Takuma Sato had like 13 in a year and Jenson Button had none. Zero. And the question always came up we couldnt find anything to show that it was one side or the other. And at that point the questions were always does Takuma drive it so much differently to Jenson that it always happens on his side I think it was just the luck of the draw. So I think its the luck of the draw this time. Pressed on whether or not there was a reason he said Not that we can find. So its not that we can see that Its this set of circumstances its always on Fernandos side. An exasperated Fernando Alonso Alpine F1 Team after retiring from the race Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images Szafnauer admitted that he understood that Alonso might be upset Look we apologise to Fernando. You always feel frustrated when youre managing a race forward backward. I mean there was no risk whatsoever. And you know the points are in the bag no ones pushing you. And that makes it even more frustrating. So I get it. The race initially went to plan for Alpine with Alonso and teammate Esteban Ocon crucially ahead of the McLarens of Lando Norris and Daniel Ricciardo. Alonso also gained a place from Valtteri Bottas with Ocon jumping the Finn later on. Once we were ahead of them it was just about managing said Szafnauer. Fernando for example was driving at about a second a lap slower than he could have. And just managing temperatures brakes. We knew it was going to be tough to get it to the end. And Esteban on the other hand did a really good job to get ahead of the McLarens. We initially set out to go on to the hard. But then we did see that the soft was possible too we watched some others. We didnt react too quickly. And Lewiss lap time was really good on the hard. So we kept with our strategy which would have worked well to the end. But Fernando had his cylinder issue which meant he had to stop. We tried to get him to limp home but eventually he couldnt. He had that issue for about 13 to 14 laps before we stopped him. The good news for Alonso is that he should have enough power unit elements in his pool to make it through the last two races without penalty This engine was never going to run again anyway. However the root cause we dont know yet. It could have been a sparkplug could have been a piston ring could have been excessive knock. Szafnauer also revealed Ocon didnt have a straightforward race to his eighth place either. Esteban in the latter half of the race started losing water pressure so we had to lift and coast it he explained. We dont know what it is yet. But it looked like it was a small water leak in the water system somewhere which is why you start losing pressure. And the best way is to stabilise it. If you can imagine if youre boiling water the pressure will raise in whatever vessel its in and you bring it down you cool it down less pressure less leak. So it didnt cause any damage. But we dont know the root cause.
Mercedes junior gets first F1 test - but is he another Russell?, https://the-race.com/formula-1/mercedes-junior-gets-first-f1-test-but-is-he-another-russell/, Mercedes junior Frederik Vesti will pilot one of the teams Formula 1 cars in the postseason Abu Dhabi Grand Prix test but can he follow in the footsteps of George Russell and progress to F1 Danish driver Vesti will get his first taste of F1 machinery in the Yas Marina test at which current Mercedes reserve Nyck de Vries is set to make an early debut for his 2023 employer AlphaTauri. Theres little immediate competition within the top ranks of the Mercedes junior programme  although 16yearold Andrea Kimi Antonelli might just be the next big thing  so Vesti was the obvious choice for the young driver test with De Vries leaving for AlphaTauri. Its still a small vindication for the hard work hes put in behind the scenes on Mercedes simulator this year. Clearly Mercedes has little room within its own F1 team with Russell thriving since he joined at the start of the year and Hamilton likely to extend his current deal beyond 2023., Mercedes junior Frederik Vesti will pilot one of the teams Formula 1 cars in the postseason Abu Dhabi Grand Prix test but can he follow in the footsteps of George Russell and progress to F1 Danish driver Vesti will get his first taste of F1 machinery in the Yas Marina test at which current Mercedes reserve Nyck de Vries is set to make an early debut for his 2023 employer AlphaTauri. De Vries was on AlphaTauris radar earlier than you might think Read more Vesti joined the Mercedes junior programme off the back of his rookie FIA Formula 3 campaign in 2020 where overall he fell short of his more experienced Prema teammates Oscar Piastri and Logan Sargeant who are both headed for F1 in 2023 with McLaren and Williams respectively although Sargeants deal is yet to be confirmed and he requires super licence points. Although he couldnt join them in the title fight and was generally thirdbest among them he did match and outshine them on occasion. He remained in F3 for 2021 and switched to another junior singleseater behemoth ART Grand Prix but a title challenge failed to materialise and he finished fourth for the second consecutive season with a single victory. Vesti then stepped up to Formula 2 with ART racing alongside Sauber protege Theo Pourchaire who along with Piastri and Sargeant had beaten Vesti in F3 in 2020. Pourchaire leads that intrateam fight as he runs second in the drivers championship heading into the Abu Dhabi finale while Vesti is eighth but only nine points adrift from fourth place. Following a tricky start where he was pointless in the opening five races Vesti looked seriously quick in the middle of the season. He picked up his maiden F2 win in Baku qualified on the front row at Silverstone and then was on pole at the Red Bull Ring. That Austrian GP feature race was a disaster as a tardy start was followed by penalties for leaving the track and gaining an advantage and track limits violations that left Vesti emptyhanded from a weekend where he looked so strong. More pointless weekends would come later in the year at Spa and Zandvoort but this was followed by an excellent brace of second place finishes at Monza such has been the rollercoaster nature of Vestis season. Consistency over a season has been lacking for Vesti since he won the Formula Regional European Championship in 2019 in a field that rarely exceeded 11 cars. Its hardly been as convincing a rise up F1s ladder as the likes of Russell who won GP3 now F3 and F2 in backtoback years but not every future F1 driver has to boast that kind of record. This years F2 season has been one of the most bizarre inconsistent and hard to read in the championships history. Vesti has by no means stood head and shoulders among that field this year but equally hes not been far off star rookie Sargeant and Jack Doohan both of whom were right among F1s 2023 silly season. Vesti will likely reunite with Prema  responsible for four of the last seven F2GP2 champions  for a second year of F2 in 2023 so he should have the right tools to deliver a potential title challenge. Theres little immediate competition within the top ranks of the Mercedes junior programme  although 16yearold Andrea Kimi Antonelli might just be the next big thing  so Vesti was the obvious choice for the young driver test with De Vries leaving for AlphaTauri. Its still a small vindication for the hard work hes put in behind the scenes on Mercedes simulator this year. Clearly Mercedes has little room within its own F1 team with Russell thriving since he joined at the start of the year and Hamilton likely to extend his current deal beyond 2023. But Vesti can still put himself in the conversation for a 2024 F1 seat somewhere on the grid if he can excel in F2 next year against some stiff competition including likely returnees Doohan Pourchaire and Dennis Hauger as well as his probable new Prema teammate highlyrated Ferrari junior Ollie Bearman. Comparisons to Russell are optimistic at this stage of Vestis career hes shown flashes of real speed but hes yet to string it together in a convincing enough fashion to demand promotion to F1 in the same way Russells results and work with Mercedes did throughout 2017 and 2018. Its down to Vesti to change that in Abu Dhabi and in 2023.

That officially makes this race more expensive than the Monaco Grand Prix  and thats also not taking into account the massive number of lush packages that are said to be available to VIPs. If you want a little perspective grandstand tickets for a full weekend at the 2023 Monaco Grand Prix will run at maximum 410.59 using prices from Goo Tickets. The most expensive threeday grandstand ticket available via Grand Prix Tickets is just about 1500. It seems like the Las Vegas Grand Prix is catering to a bigticket buyer and the rest of us will be left in the dust., Formula 1s upcoming 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix is one of the more hyped events to join the series calendar and now it looks like prices are going to reflect that hype. According to presale information via the tracks website youre going to be paying 500 for General Admission alone  or 2000 if you want a guaranteed seat. That officially makes this race more expensive than the Monaco Grand Prix  and thats also not taking into account the massive number of lush packages that are said to be available to VIPs. If you want a little perspective grandstand tickets for a full weekend at the 2023 Monaco Grand Prix will run at maximum 410.59 using prices from Goo Tickets. The most expensive threeday grandstand ticket available via Grand Prix Tickets is just about 1500. Im going to be honest If I paid 500 to literally stand around in one small flat area of Las Vegas in the hopes of seeing a race car on a street circuit and could get my hands on no beverage more powerful than a 0 Heineken Id snap. That right there would be my Joaquin Phoenix Joker moment. Advertisement If you were looking for a grandstand ticket you can expect to pay somewhere between 2000 and 2500  though it currently isnt clear if those are static ticket prices or if those are just the starting price for certain grandstands. For example at Circuit of the Americas certain rows of a grandstand may cost more than a different row of the same grandstand due to the view. Youll have to inquire about hospitality as well but Skybox shared hospitality is priced at 10000 for four days. I also want to note that these are presale prices listed via Ticketmaster knowing how Ticketmaster sales usually go theres a good chance scalpers are going to make a pretty penny on resales for the folks who didnt nab tickets right away. GO Media may get a commission 400 off Anker 767 PowerHouse Powered by GaNPrime Anker is launching a new power station in its lineupthe Anker 767 PowerHouse. It delivers a massive amount of power at 2400W and has a suitcase design for easy portability. Buy for 400 off at Anker Advertisement The thing that I find most fascinating is that these tickets are grouped together by small region and you only have access to that region. If you have tickets for hospitality in the South Koval Zone for example you cant go pop over to General Admission and see how things are going. You cant meet up with a friend behind the West Harmon Zone grandstands. I understand that temporary street circuits are inherently limited but Ive never seen such a cordoning off of track regions. Of course my experience largely comes from IndyCar where street circuits like Long Beach Detroit Toronto and St. Pete generally confine viewers to certain areas  but you can still wander around all those areas. In Miami for Formula 1 it was the same story there were a lot of places you couldnt go but any area open to one fan was open to all fans. Ive been looking forward to covering the event as media but it also makes me wonder how much Id actually get to see in order to report on the track ambiance. Advertisement Its going to be interesting to see how the limited fan experience plays out  though Im not sure many of the folks buying tickets are going to be the Average Joe who adores F1. It seems like the Las Vegas Grand Prix is catering to a bigticket buyer and the rest of us will be left in the dust.

Ferrari’s rivals don’t think Mexico slump was true reflection of F1 form, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/ferrari-rivals-mexico-slump-form/10393998/, That left the door open for Mercedes to emerge as Red Bulls main challenger for the victory. However few believe that the Mexico showing was realistic of where Ferrari stacks up right now.

I think Ferrari looked like they were a little bit handicapped this weekend so Im not sure we saw their real pace. Im pretty sure if Im listening at the drivers later on in the debriefing they will tell me that the car was not turning., Listen to this article Ferrari endured one of its most challenging outings of the season in Mexico last weekend as it could not extract its regular pace from the F175. That left the door open for Mercedes to emerge as Red Bulls main challenger for the victory. In the end Carlos Sainz was the lead Ferrari to come home in fifth place but he finished more than 58 seconds behind race winner Max Verstappen. With Mercedes having enjoyed an uplift in form over recent races Ferraris performances have prompted suggestions that Red Bulls main threat is now the German car manufacturer rather than the Italian squad. However few believe that the Mexico showing was realistic of where Ferrari stacks up right now. Asked if Red Bull regarded Mercedes as its strongest competitor in F1 team boss Christian Horner said I think this track has played to their strengths. I think Ferrari looked like they were a little bit handicapped this weekend so Im not sure we saw their real pace. Im sure theyll be back. Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff reckons that while things have gone better for his squad in recent outings a much better picture would emerge from the Brazilian GP. Pushed on if he felt Mercedes was ahead of Ferrari Wolff said I wouldnt want to say that because they are a strong team and weve had a few strong Sundays now. But maybe this circuit flattered us. I think after Brazil well have maybe more of a picture but I dont think theyre suddenly half a minute slower than us. George Russell Mercedes W13 Carlos Sainz Ferrari F175 Charles Leclerc Ferrari F175 Photo by Sam Bloxham  Motorsport Images Ferrari is hopeful that the scale of its deficit in Mexico was a oneoff caused by altitude which meant its power unit could not perform as well as it does nearer sealevel. However team principal Mattia Binotto said that a lack of power did not offer a full explanation for why it was so far adrift of Red Bull and Mercedes. I think the compromise both of them drivers are mentioning certainly is in terms of power unit we were not at our best performance for the weekend he said. But I dont think that thats explaining the most. Thats part of the equation but there is certainly more than that and its something which we need to look at. There is not a clear answer right now. The ride was not great. The balance was not great. Im pretty sure if Im listening at the drivers later on in the debriefing they will tell me that the car was not turning. The reason why I think it has to be looked at and we have not a clear explanation right now. Additional reporting by Filip Cleeren

He originally joined Ferrari as an apprentice in 1960 having graduated from the University of Bologna with a mechanical engineering degree. Having made a good early impression following the departure of then chief designer Carlo Chiti in 1961 he was asked by team founder Enzo Ferrari to step up to head the technical side of the team.

When Lamborghinis engineering department was reorganised at the end of 1991 and the Modena team ran out of funding Forghieri left and helped set up the mechanical design Oral Engineering Group whose clients included BMW Bugatti and Aprilia. He was still involved with the project until recently. Mauro Forghieri consults Niki Lauda Photo by David Phipps The Italian kept a close eye on F1 and several years ago famously made it clear how he did not like the current rules that allowed for DRS. I dislike the whole aerodynamics of the current cars he said. I dont understand why it is not reduced in order to allow normal overtaking without DRS. Now if ones opponent is less than a second behind he can only watch as his pursuer goes past  and that cannot be correct. A world champion needs to be in a position to overtake his opponent without help. Otherwise in my eyes he is not a world champion.

Ferrari's Shwartzman 'very sad' at fading Formula 1 dream, https://www.motorsportweek.com/2022/11/02/ferraris-shwartzman-very-sad-at-fading-formula-1-dream/, Ferrari test driver Robert Shwartzman has conceded that his Formula 1 race ambitions are likely over after missing out on a seat for another season. What will happen in the future I dont know yet but its super hard and challenging to get into Formula 1. I dont really understand it the lineup and the driver decisions teams do I dont get it from my side. If you dont race you miss that spirit of being a race driver to fight to win and push yourself. Imagine if I dont race I will wait wait wait and if I have the opportunity I would not be ready for it as I had not raced since 2021., Ferrari test driver Robert Shwartzman has conceded that his Formula 1 race ambitions are likely over after missing out on a seat for another season. Shwartzman was among Ferraris leading junior prospects claiming the 2019 FIA Formula 3 title and finished fourth in his rookie Formula 2 campaign before placing runnerup to teammate Oscar Piastri in 2021. Of the 2020 crop champion Mick Schumacher Yuki Tsunoda and Nikita Mazepin stepped up to Formula 1 while from the 2021 group Zhou Guanyu debuted this year and champion Piastri will belatedly graduate with McLaren in 2023. Shwartzman instead took up a role with Ferrari as its official test driver and was tasked with undertaking extensive simulator duties. He was nominated as its young driver participating in FP1 in Austin and will partake in the corresponding session in Abu Dhabi. Offtrack Shwartzman also switched his racing license to Israel the country of his birth and has spent much of the year in Italy to where he moved as a child. Honestly it was a tough year Shwartzman tells MotorsportWeek.com. Unfortunately I didnt race which for any racing driver is a big thing. What will happen in the future I dont know yet but its super hard and challenging to get into Formula 1. I always pushed and worked really hard it didnt matter what was going around with the dream or target to get to Formula 1. Will it happen or not happen At this stage I dont know. I can guess maybe not. And thats obviously very sad for me because it has been such a big work and I kept on pushing and believing and at the end still it doesnt happen for various reasons. Shwartzman accepts that the thing I could have done a bit better is bring the results those years in 2020 and 2021 and that would probably give me a bigger help to get into F1 but stresses theres still no guarantee Id be there. There is also an aspect of disillusionment with the structure of the driver market. I mean F1 is a bit weird to be honest these days for me at least he says. I dont really understand it the lineup and the driver decisions teams do I dont get it from my side. I dont want to put names but for me unfortunately it doesnt always go by the merit. Oscar had to wait a year and it was a bit messy for him. I put myself in it as well I pushed him hard did hard work and I know if I would have a chance Id show Im capable. It is what it is at this stage its the situation where I cant do anything about it even though Id love to and make it more fair. Robert Shwartzman RUS  ISR Ferrari Developement Driver. United States Grand Prix Friday 21st October 2022. Circuit of the Americas Austin Texas USA. When pressed on why he feels that way Shwartzman replies Well I cant go up to a team and say take me because I really deserve it and would bring the results I cant do that because I can say it prove it and show it on eventual results but the decisionmaking thing is not going to be on me. So looking at how it is now its maybe not the main priority for them. The status of 2019 F2 champion Nyck de Vries is raised with the Dutchman sealing a 2023 AlphaTauri seat hugely facilitated by his substitute appearance with Williams at Monza. But Shwartzman isnt keen on such a strategy and wants to get back behind the wheel somewhere in 2023. Honestly for Nyck it happened after three years he raced and honestly I respect Nyck and think hes talented and good but the stars aligned perfectly for him and he did a good job of taking that opportunity  he got one shot and he took it Shwartzman explains. Will I Who knows. To wait and sit here and waste time not racing just hoping for a miracle to happen I would not really see it quite logical for me and anyway after doing this work I really want to race next year as I miss racing. If you dont race you miss that spirit of being a race driver to fight to win and push yourself. Imagine if I dont race I will wait wait wait and if I have the opportunity I would not be ready for it as I had not raced since 2021. So for me the main priority next year is to go race. Where I dont know we are looking at options and what we have on the table for the best offer possible and well see. Shwartzman is nonetheless hopeful that the recent setbacks will stand him in stronger stead for 2023 and beyond. Theres positives to take as I matured more I learned more I know how to handle myself better with the engineers how to work with them better so anyway for my career  it doesnt matter where I will be  it was an important phase in my life he reflects. We did a few tests with the old car I did the FP1 first time in Austin the first time in the car so it was very interesting and very cool. Well have another one in Abu Dhabi thats it not much driving unfortunately but it is what it is.

The underrated Verstappen trait behind his new F1 record, https://the-race.com/formula-1/the-underrated-verstappen-trait-behind-his-new-f1-record/, And it is no coincidence that the same drivers tend to excel in this area  with Verstappen certainly among them. Verstappens tyre management has won him races before this. His first victory in Spain in 2016 on his Red Bull debut is a favoured example. While the softmedium strategy didnt seem to be seriously on many peoples radar Red Bull was confident it was possible because it had two drivers capable of making it work. Even when Verstappen looked occasionally vulnerable to Hamiltons chasing Mercedes he always managed to keep it at arms length., Max Verstappens recordbreaking 14th victory in the 2022 Formula 1 season came down to something that he talked about after his ninth. Its not only today I think Im always good on tyres Verstappen said at the Belgian Grand Prix when asked about how well he had managed his Pirellis in an extended opening stint on softs. Maybe people dont look at it. Just as that win at Spa required a gentle touch to manage the softs and make a onestop strategy work effectively so too did his Mexican Grand Prix win last weekend. The implication with Verstappens answer at Spa obviously was that when the likes of Sergio Perez and Lewis Hamilton get hailed as tyre whisperers Verstappens own skill in this regard is underrated. He was right though. Verstappens headline qualities are his speed and his aggression. But he is a much more refined driver than that. Tyre management is one of F1s unsexy skills and can sometimes be dismissed as a particularly negative aspect of modern F1  as if it was never a factor in years gone by. It is a crucial skill. And it is no coincidence that the same drivers tend to excel in this area  with Verstappen certainly among them. Verstappens tyre management has won him races before this. His first victory in Spain in 2016 on his Red Bull debut is a favoured example. In Austria in 2018 he drove cleverly by lifting slightly through the highspeed corners to put a little less energy into them and avoid the blistering issues that struck thenteammate Ricciardo and Hamilton. That year he also obliterated Ricciardo in Mexico where he has now won four times pulling a full pitstop on him despite managing his laptimes and his tyres after grabbing the lead at the start. This year has provided different case studies. If there is a specific modern F1 demand it is that the working range of the Pirellis requires the tyre to be brought in carefully or they will not last as long as they should. Those who truly get on top of this have a wonderful sensitivity. They feel the tyre underneath them and usually know how hard they can push without taking it too far. At the same time if they do wander into some tyre strife they can get it back under control. For instance this helped Verstappen win the United States Grand Prix where after losing time in his pitstop he had to work the tyres harder than hed have liked running in the dirty air of the Ferrari of Charles Leclerc and then passing it. By his own admission I damaged my tyres a little bit too much in the beginning of that new tyre set and that meant Verstappen had to be restrained in his chase of Hamilton to recover the tyres. Which he did and then he pushed and then caught Hamilton and then he passed him to win. Verstappen has more patience in certain scenarios than he is given credit for aided by the growing confidence hes had that the car will have enough pace once the tyres are where they need to be. This was the case in Mexico a race that demands a lot of discipline. While the softmedium strategy didnt seem to be seriously on many peoples radar Red Bull was confident it was possible because it had two drivers capable of making it work. Even when Verstappen looked occasionally vulnerable to Hamiltons chasing Mercedes he always managed to keep it at arms length. I never really felt like I was under pressure I was just managing my tyres to get through that number of laps he said. The key Mercedes mistakes that surprised Red Bull in Mexico Read more Once Verstappen got a good idea of what the softs could handle he pushed to build his lead to over two seconds and that gave him a buffer as the tyres started to fall away right at the end of the stint. But he had done enough to make the long run on mediums realistic. It was still a question mark Verstappen said but within a few laps he had the feeling he needed to get to the end. Which he did. It was an achievement against Mercedes initial expectations but in keeping with Verstappens proficiency at not abusing the tyre and therefore another example of what Red Bull team boss Christian Horner believes Verstappen has been masterful at this year. When you see how hes playing with the tools that he has available to him within the car hes constantly on top of them said Horner. You hear the banter between him and his engineer and hes got a tremendous feel for what the tyres need and what they dont need and its something hes developed. Hes always been strong at it but I think this year hes been exceptional.

The 2022 Championship has not been the season Ricciardo had hoped for with the Aussie struggling to break into the top ten. As the pressure mounted so too did rumours of his imminent exit McLaren finally confirming that as F1 returned from the summer break. But while the Honey Badgers fans dreamt of the results finally flowing once the weight of expectation was lifted that too didnt happen. Despondent after a wretched United States Grand Prix Ricciardo said Honestly its just 2022 when you think it cant get worse it does. Thats where I dont know I dont know how Im continuing to continue because to say its painful is an understatement. He vowed to spring back and spring back he did putting in his best drive of the championship in Mexico where he came from 12.5s behind Esteban Ocon to overtake several cars before taking P7 off him. He then put 12 seconds between himself and the Alpine driver to negate the 10second time penalty hed received for hitting Yuki Tsunoda. He was voted Driver of the Day a muchwelcomed plaudit for the beleaguered driver.

With his McLaren career over Ricciardo is now looking ahead to a year on the sidelines with the 33yearold taking the time to recharge before potentially returning in 2024. Turning down the chance of a Haas seat he said Its now just trying to set myself up for success Id call it in the long term. Hulkenberg reckons its a welcome break for the eighttime grand prix winner. I think after the two turbulent years hes glad that hes going to be out for a year and can sort himself out he said. Knowing him and seeing his body language I think he needs to get off this Formula 1 rat race.

More info Formula One CEO Stefano Domenicali may end up angering Christian Horner and Toto Wolff after he travelled to Colombia to discuss adding a race there to the sports schedule. The two great rivals have both previously spoken out about the length of the F1 calendar and may worry about the impact of another South American race on their Red Bull and Mercedes colleagues. In 2023 Formula One will have more races than ever before with 24 events scheduled to be on the calendar. However it looks like it could grow even further with Domenicali entering negotiations with Colombia about a future Grand Prix while a return to South Africa has also been widely mooted. Under the terms of the Concorde Agreement signed in 2020 no more than 25 races can take place within a season meaning current events would have to drop off if Colombia and South Africa were to join with Belgium among the most likely. Yet this may not be enough to pacify Wolff and Horner after the team bosses were unhappy with the expanded calendar for next year. The Austrian argued the change was unsustainable and he claimed that he would no longer travel to all races as a result.

Tickets to the F1 Las Vegas GP Go on Sale Starting at $500, https://www.thedrive.com/news/tickets-to-the-las-vegas-gp-go-on-sale-starting-at-500, Tickets have gone on sale for the firstever Las Vegas Grand Prix and as with everything in Formula 1 theyre rather expensive. Liberty Media is investing big in the Las Vegas Grand Prix as part of its broader push into the US market. The Las Vegas race will be the penultimate championship round in 2023 taking place on November 18 just prior to the season finale at Abu Dhabi. Pedants will note that while this the first inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix its not the first Grand Prix to take place in Las Vegas. Steep ticket prices arent particularly surprising then let alone in Las Vegas., Tickets have gone on sale for the firstever Las Vegas Grand Prix and as with everything in Formula 1 theyre rather expensive. The official ticketing website began presales to American Express Early Access customers on Tuesday. In the Phase 1 offering a basic general admission ticket will set you back 500 for a threeday pass. This is for the standingroom only section at the MSG Sphere and includes a food and nonalcoholic drinks package. Its unclear whether these are the promised affordable tickets that would be made available but The Drive has requested clarification and will update this article accordingly. Those wanting a seat in the MSG Sphere grandstand section will have to cough up 2000 for the privilege. The MSG Sphere zone covers from Turn 5 through to Turn 9 including the lowspeed switchback of Turn 7 and Turn 8. The coveted startfinish straight is covered by the East Harmon zone. A seat in the grandstand there comes at a higher cost of 2500. Beyond that are the Skybox tickets for those with the deepest pockets. Unlike the lower tier tickets these cover four days of action across the weekend. They also cost 10000 apiece. At this stage tickets are still in the presale phase. Sales will open to those who registered for the Priority Interest List on November 3 before going on sale to the general public on November 5. All tickets will be sold as minimum threeday passes so dont expect to save money by only showing up for the race. There is also a limit of eight tickets per customer via the official ticketing outlet. Liberty Media is investing big in the Las Vegas Grand Prix as part of its broader push into the US market. The 2023 calendar will feature three races stateside with the new event joining the existing Miami and Austin races on the calendar. The Las Vegas race will be the penultimate championship round in 2023 taking place on November 18 just prior to the season finale at Abu Dhabi. Pedants will note that while this the first inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix its not the first Grand Prix to take place in Las Vegas. That honor goes to the oftridiculed Caesars Palace Grand Prix run in 1981 and 1982. Taking place on a track literally built in a casino car park the circuit was unpopular with drivers and attracted few fans. Originally a Formula 1 World Championship event it was retooled into a CART race for 1983 and 1984 before being abandoned altogether. Formula 1 has never been a budget sport for the fans or the drivers. Steep ticket prices arent particularly surprising then let alone in Las Vegas. Still if youre looking to get involved 500 for a threeday pass isnt too bad especially given the food and drinks are on the house.
Stefano Domenicali flew from Mexico to Colombia for grand prix talks, https://www.planetf1.com/news/stefano-domenicali-colombia-f1-talks/, Stefano Domenicali is reported to have travelled to Colombia for talks over taking Formula 1 to the South American nation in the future. The climate change effort we are making in the city would be one of the most important points of this grand prix. It would be the event with the highest turnover in Colombia. 23 to 24 races is a good number but I dont want to discuss more said Domenicali quoted by MotorsportMagazin.com. There are many factors taken into account but the number of grands prix is clear., Stefano Domenicali is reported to have travelled to Colombia for talks over taking Formula 1 to the South American nation in the future. The Colombian city of Barranquilla expressed an interest earlier this year about bringing Formula 1 to the country possibly under the marque of the Grand Prix of the Caribbean with city mayor Jaime Pumarejo saying he wants to see Colombia on the calendar from the 2024 season. Colombian publication El Heraldo reported the Formula 1 chief executive flew from Mexico to Colombia after the race at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez with talks expected to continue over their proposed race  Pumarejo hoping to secure a 10year deal for a semiurban layout in Barranquilla. What we can say is the process is going very well the mayor told Blu Radio in September quoted by MARCA. Progress has been made in all the previous steps before a final decision. The climate change effort we are making in the city would be one of the most important points of this grand prix. In addition it would be selfsustainable i.e. the development of the race would not cost the country and the city but on the contrary would bring employment tourism and recognition. In one of the routes the river is the protagonist in another not but both are in the metropolitan area of Barranquilla. We hope if all that remains to be done we could be talking about 2024 or 2025 and it would be signed for 10 years. It would be the event with the highest turnover in Colombia. A Formula 1 grand prix has a turnover in two or three days of 2.5 times what Corferias a convention centre in Bogot has a turnover in the whole year. Colombias proposed arrival on the calendar would have to be at the expense of another circuit however with Domenicali having claimed recently Formula 1 has now reached its maximum number of races  with a record 24 penned for next seasons calendar along with six sprints. 23 to 24 races is a good number but I dont want to discuss more said Domenicali quoted by MotorsportMagazin.com. The venues are chosen around this number. There are many factors taken into account but the number of grands prix is clear. At 24 the maximum is reached. The market demands this number of races. We used to have 15 races but that was a different situation. Theres a lot of interest now and hopefully it will get even bigger in the future.

FIA branded "childish" over Lewis Hamilton row by ex-star as controversy hurts F1 "boom", https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/fia-hamilton-jewellery-rules-grosjean-28383822, For many years it has been written into law that F1 drivers are not allowed to wear jewellery while driving their cars. But FIA president Mohammed ben Sulayem decided earlier this year that his federation would be clamping down on it. And it is far from the only offtrack issue which has taken the gloss off the racing action this season. Image AFP via Getty Images AFP via Getty ImagesFormula 1 is booming and the racing is great and fans attendance is amazing. I just felt like some of the jewellery rules you know..., Offtrack arguments and disputes have been a theme in recent months and threaten to overshadow the racing action in a sport which has gained so many new followers in recent years Romain Grosjean called out the FIA over their childish jewellery standoff with Lewis Hamilton and believes there are too many rules in Formula 1. For many years it has been written into law that F1 drivers are not allowed to wear jewellery while driving their cars. But while it was in the rulebook it was one of those matters that was rarely if ever actually enforced. But FIA president Mohammed ben Sulayem decided earlier this year that his federation would be clamping down on it. That led to a lengthy standoff with Hamilton who felt it was a ridiculous rule and even began turning up to media interviews wearing more jewellery than usual just to make a point. He also had some medical exemptions over his nose stud which he argued was difficult to remove. But as the FIA issued an ultimatum he eventually backed down removing it ahead of first practice ahead of the British Grand Prix in early July. And it is far from the only offtrack issue which has taken the gloss off the racing action this season. One of the more recent involved Fernando Alonso when he finished P7 in the USA but had that taken away from him after a Haas protest after the race before having his points finish reinstated several days later. Despite F1s massive growth over the past few years Grosjean feels some of those newer fans may be turned off if arguments continue to overshadow the sport. Offtrack some of the things that that were talked about this year were I dont know a little bit childish  it just feels like its not really necessary the former Haas racer told Sky Sports Any Driven Monday programme. Image AFP via Getty Images AFP via Getty Images Formula 1 is booming and the racing is great and fans attendance is amazing. I just felt like some of the jewellery rules you know... I wouldnt feel comfortable driving without my wedding ring just because thats part of me and I love it. So that wasnt great. Theres been so many rules in Formula 1 that you know its complicated  like the Alonso case. Its just a bad example of too many rules. Like they didnt use the rule in the race and then postrace they ruled that its unsafe but the harm was already made. If it was unsafe he should have stopped the car before. And then there was some more rules on top of the rules that meant Alpine could get the position back and its just complicated. Image Sky Sports Sky Sports Same as the cost cap you know I think Red Bull the only one punished for lets say two million over budget. So its not a huge deal. But lets say they had been 10 or 20 million above the budget. What would you have done Would you take away the world championship 10 or 11 months later Its just been a little bit complicated and a few things need to be tidied up. But the cost cap is probably one of the best things with the halo that came to Formula 1 in the last 20 years. So thats great. The racing is great the enthusiasm in the States is huge. Everyone talks about Formula 1. So theres definitely a really good wave to surf here.

Norris started the race in eighth but lost out to both Alpines of Fernando Alonso and Esteban Ocon on the first lap dropping down to 10th. He maintained that position before switching from the mediums to the hard tyre as he attempted to avoid the undercut from AlphaTauris Yuki Tsunoda  who changed from the softs to the mediums. Norris was then able to make his way past Valtteri Bottas for tenth towards the end of the race. Alonsos retirement saw him gain a place to ninth after he also let team mate Daniel Ricciardo  on the soft tyre  through to finish seventh ahead of Ocon.

Norris: Mexico F1 strategy "a mistake" relative to McLaren teammate Ricciardo, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/norris-mexico-strategy-mistake-ricciardo/10393568/, In contrast Norris who stopped earlier joined several others in going from the medium to the hard only to find it was lacking performance. He finished ninth some 16.5 seconds behind Ricciardo on the road having been three places ahead of him early on. Just one off the line and then one around the first few corners which is just a bit unlucky sometimes. He added We covered Yuki Tsunoda very early on which meant I had to go onto the hard tyre. I wouldnt say Brazil is going to suit us at all with our balance of the car and so on and our struggles., Listen to this article Ricciardo went from medium to soft tyres and had sufficient pace to not only charge up to seventh place but also negate a 10second penalty for contact with Yuki Tsunoda. In contrast Norris who stopped earlier joined several others in going from the medium to the hard only to find it was lacking performance. He finished ninth some 16.5 seconds behind Ricciardo on the road having been three places ahead of him early on. The Englishmans race had already been compromised by a difficult first lap in which he was passed by Fernando Alonso and Esteban Ocon of Alpine the team that McLaren is battling for fourth position in the world championship. I lost just two places in the beginning obviously both to Alpines which is the main thing he explained when asked by Motorsport.com about his start. Just one off the line and then one around the first few corners which is just a bit unlucky sometimes. So nothing too bad just the way it is. The rest I think we did a reasonable job. Norris made it clear that he did not get to run the strategy that he had hoped to use estimating that Ricciardos strategy was worth over 30 seconds over his own. He added We covered Yuki Tsunoda very early on which meant I had to go onto the hard tyre. So I would not really what I wanted to do. So maybe a bit of a mistake there to do that. But Daniel did what I wanted to do which was to stay out and then go onto the soft which was like 3040 seconds quicker in terms of race time. I think we did the best we could. Still managed to get past Bottas bought us with a few laps to go. So that one extra point always helps. Regarding the general lack of grip he said I mean thats just what we have to deal with. Yeah we made a mistake going onto the hard tyre. You dont have to use it we chose to. Thats life. Esteban Ocon Alpine A522 Lando Norris McLaren MCL36 Yuki Tsunoda AlphaTauri AT03 Photo by Sam Bloxham  Motorsport Images Norris is unsure about the teams potential form in Brazil as the battle with Alpine over fourth in the constructors title continues. The Enstone outfit currently leads by just seven points with two races remaining on the calendar and Norris was not especially buoyant about McLarens chances in Brazil. It makes me happy that were closing the gap he said. But were working hard. So I feel like we deserve to be getting what were getting at the end of the day. But it means we still have to work extremely hard to beat them over the next two races. I dont know how were going to do to be honest with you. I wouldnt say Brazil is going to suit us at all with our balance of the car and so on and our struggles. But I think even the last few races weve not been the quickest car or quick enough weve just done a better job with the strategy and with reliability such as today. So lets get to the chequered flag.

Delusional Horner is tarnishing the whole sport of Formula One, https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/delusional-horner-is-tarnishing-the-whole-sport-of-formula-one-d59jpvs3n, Lewis Hamilton was robbed. Even the FIA the governing body admits that it was a significant error from the race director. So permit me to say it again Hamilton was robbed. If the rules had been correctly applied he would now have an eighth world title. Horner may now be pondering whether, Lewis Hamilton was robbed. I think we should make that plain at the start of this column. I emphasise this because Christian Horner and Max Verstappen of Red Bull decided to boycott Sky Sports after one of its reporters used this word in relation to the finale of the 2021 season after a controversial safety car restart in the last moments of the race. Even the FIA the governing body admits that it was a significant error from the race director. So permit me to say it again Hamilton was robbed.

This year its a bit 5050 sometimes we get the qualifying right sometimes we get the race right. It is a bit of a moving board he commented. I think if you look at where we were at the start of the year and where we are now we generally really understand the cars weaknesses we get on top of them and we maximise the weekends.

Red Bull introduced a new engine cover at Silverstone with a channel between the upper and lower parts forming a bulge., The Red Bull RB18 will go down as one of the most successful F1 cars in the sports history. In taking Max Verstappen to his second world title and the team to their fifth constructors championship their first in nine years it has won 16 of the seasons 20 races to date  14 for Verstappen and two for Sergio Perez. It has proven to be a masterwork response to a set of radically new aerodynamic regulations which have been problematic for most other teams. Chief Technical Officer Adrian Newey feeds into the Red Bull technical group which created the car a group that includes Technical Director Pierre Wache Head of Aerodynamics Enrico Balbo Chief Engineering Officer Rob Marshall Chief Designer Craig Skinner Head of Performance Engineering Ben Waterhouse and Chief Engineer car Paul Monaghan. Newey has experience of ground effect cars from much earlier in his career and certainly he will have been aware of some of the possible hazards lying in wait with such a concept of car featuring an arodynamically superpowerful underbody. But Neweys actual design input in this case is limited to the suspension  though that is a crucial part of the cars allround excellence. READ MORE Verstappen makes F1 history as he beats Hamilton to victory in Mexico for 14th win of the season The car is powered by Hondas powerful reliable and compact RA621 a refinement of the power unit introduced in 2021. Around this Red Bull created a car with a distinctive and elegant sidepod layout with a deep undercut at the front beneath the inlet vanes to the venturi tunnels at the heart of the new regulations. Here we look at each of the key design elements of the car and what has differentiated it from its rivals. Verstappen and the RB18 have formed a dominant partnership this season winning 14 races out of 20 so far Floor The underfloor is absolutely key to performance under these regulations with downforce generated by tunnels either side of a central flat keel. The speed of the air flowing through these tunnels and the air pressure differential between the underfloor and the upper surface of the car creates massive downforce effectively sucking the car to the ground. READ MORE Hes been perfect  Horner full of praise after Verstappens recordbreaking victory But Red Bulls treatment of the tunnels is quite different to that of any other car. Others have created a teardropshaped central keel to shape the tunnels around but the Red Bulls keel is far less uniform in shape. The roof of the tunnels also appear to be higher and more arched. The combination of the profile changes of the keel and the varying height of the tunnels seems to be an effort at carefully matching the volume of the tunnel along its length to give a more consistent airflow and at no point has the car been seriously troubled by the porpoising phenomenon seen elsewhere. Ferrari underfloor left contrasted with that of Red Bull right. It can be seen that the central keel of the RB18 floor is nothing like the conventional teardrop shape on the F175. This seems to be part of a very careful matching with the height of the tunnels either side to give a more consistent volume for the airflow. This would theoretically lower the peak downforce generated by the floor but make it far more stallproof and tolerant of different ride heights. The key to these regulations has proved to be not how much peak downforce can be created by the floor through highspeed corners when the rear ride height is low but how much can be retained in slower corners when the ride height is greater. The Red Bulls floor arrangement is much more tolerant of ride height changes than others even if GPS data suggests it doesnt achieve as high a maximum downforce as the Ferrari or the Mercedes in faster corners. READ MORE I never thought Id be able to win 14 races in a year says recordbreaker Verstappen in Mexico Even the profile of the edges of the inlet vanes to the tunnel are nonuniform and seem to be matched to the profile of the tunnel. Red Bull used a variety of inlet vane and floor edge arrangements to tune the car to particular circuits. These changes would vary aero characteristics of the car and the centre of pressure acting upon the front and rear axles. It suggested the team had a very high fidelity control of its underfloor airflow. Left At Paul Ricard Red Bull moved the two outermost tunnel inlet vanes further apart. Although the team regularly tweaked the shape of these vanes to match specific circuit demands this was the biggest change. Right This tonguelike insert in the floor ahead of the rear tyres was introduced at Silverstone and is similar to a feature first seen on the Ferrari. Its believed to relieve excess pressure created in that part of the floor by tyre squirt at low ride heights. Suspension Red Bull like McLaren responded to the new regulations by switching around their suspension from pushrod frontpullrod rear to the opposite. Red Bull felt that the pullrod arrangement at the front  with the rockers up high  allowed a better airflow route to the tunnel inlets while at the rear a pushrod arrangement gave a better stiffer and lighter mechanical installation. Previously the high rockers of a pullrod rear had allowed more scope to powerfully develop the brake duct shapes but with these a standardised item for 2022 that scope was no longer there. MONDAY MORNING DEBRIEF How cunning strategy allowed us to see Ricciardo back at his best in Mexico The rear suspension had a notably long travel to accommodate a variety of ride heights. It would sink very low at high speed to reduce drag even though it usually had a greater static ride height than any other car. This was a key part of the cars consistent straightline speed advantage over the competition. To get the car to sink in such a way would require a relatively soft suspension springing rate and on other cars such a setting would induce bouncing. The Red Bull floors resistance to aerodynamic stalling was probably part of enabling the softer suspension to work. Main image Red Bulls 2022 front suspension in detail. Left inset Red Bulls 2021 pushrod layout. It is now the front upper arm which passes through the chassis whereas previously it was the front lower arm. That upper arm is mounted higher than the rear lower arm not visible here giving an antidive geometry. Inset right A beautiful detail is the adjustment of the ride height outside of the pedal box. On other cars notably the Mercedes the suspension had to be run stiff enough to keep the car outside of the ride heightspeed combinations which would induce bouncing at a frequency and would then cause the car to be bouncing on its tyre sidewalls too. The Red Bull was seemingly completely immune from this. At the front Newey had opted for a multilink arrangement once again with the upper forward link mounted high and the upper rearwards link lower to resist the dive of the car under braking thereby limiting the rear ride height increase and the downforce loss it entails. READ MORE 6 Winners and 5 Losers from the Mexico City Grand Prix  Who left the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez on a high A beautiful detail was having the ride height adjuster on the external part of the suspension usually its within the central part with the rockers for easy access. The multilink arrangement  with separate attachment points for the various suspension links  will be heavier but it allows those links to work more independently and thereby give a better ride quality. This gives a more stable aerodynamic platform. As a side benefit the car will be better over the kerbs. Red Bull introduced a new engine cover at Silverstone with a channel between the upper and lower parts forming a bulge. This both increased the cooling capacity and improved the airflow to the rear corner of the car normally two conflicting requirements.
How F1 teams reacted to Mexico’s high-altitude headaches, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/how-f1-teams-reacted-to-mexicos-high-altitude-headaches/10393735/, All of this leads to teams running what might otherwise be considered odd choices given its such a highspeed venue. It was a similar story at the rear of the car too as both drivers flirted with different arrangements. The team also had the option of incorporating a Gurney flap on the trailing edge of the main engine cover outlet in order to help with extraction. Alpha Tauri AT03 cooling panel comparisonMeanwhile at the rear of the car the engine covers bodywork was expanded. This not only increased the size of the rear cooling outlet but also resulted in a larger rear deck upon which the air flowed to the rear of the car., Listen to this article At 2285m above sea level the rarefied air creates a significant challenge in respect of car aerodynamics cooling requirements and the performance envelope of the power unit. All of this leads to teams running what might otherwise be considered odd choices given its such a highspeed venue. Mercedes experimented with its wing levels on Friday not only as a means to hone in on the performance levels of the car at this venue but also for gathering meaningful data for next years car too. Comparing the two front wings put into service during free practice outings Lewis Hamiltons car was fitted with the older specification version with the trailing edge of the upper flap cut back quite significantly left image below. Meanwhile George Russells W13 was fitted with the new wing design which features a revised design to the outer section of the flaps and a more contoured endplate to help generate outwash. However the team did opt to remove the controversial slot gap separator brackets that first appeared at the United States Grand Prix but remain unraced. Youll also note that chequerboard stickers were adhered to the front wing endplate on Hamiltons car with a camera used to capture footage of the wing whilst its out on track in order that the team can ascertain its performing as anticipated. It was a similar story at the rear of the car too as both drivers flirted with different arrangements. George Russell carried a Gurney flap mounted on the trailing edge of the rear wing whilst Hamilton matching the cutdown approach taken with the front wing was running the wing without one on his. Following the tests conducted by Hamilton on Friday both drivers opted for the newer front wing specification with a more loaded flap arrangement plus the Gurney on the trailing edge of the rear wings upper flap for qualifying and the race. Meanwhile the maximum cooling option was taken up on both cars with the panels beside the cockpit and the engine cover gills both opened up in order to reject the heat being generated. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes W13 Photo by Steven Tee  Motorsport Images Red Bull also opted for more cooling to meet the demands being posed as the RB18 ran with the louvred cooling panels on the shoulder of the engine cover and a new wider cooling exit at the rear that also flared on the trailing edge to help with extraction. McLaren decided to take cooling in Mexico pretty seriously as several new options appeared in order to deal with the demands posed by the circuit and altitude. A more expansive louvred cooling panel could be found traversing the MCL36s sidepod and engine cover with two outlets also added to its cooling suite on the engine covers spine one of these is mounted above the power unit saddle coolers and the other is just aft of the shark fin red arrows. The team also had the option of incorporating a Gurney flap on the trailing edge of the main engine cover outlet in order to help with extraction. To increase local load at the rear of the car McLaren had also made changes to its rear brake duct aero adding some winglets to the stack already present on the rearwardfacing outlet scoop. Alpine also deployed its maximum cooling configuration as the A522 was fitted with the open louvred sidepod bodywork and the enlarged engine cover outlet panel that was last seen in Hungary but not raced. Alpine F1 A522 cooling detail Photo by Giorgio Piola Alpha Tauri invested in revisions to help with its temperature issues in Mexico too as the AT03s front brakes featured an enlarged rear outlet scoop resulting in an increase in mass flow through the assembly. The cooling gill panel on the side of the engine cover was also revised with the number of louvres reduced but their spacing increased as they still filled the same available space within the panel. Alpha Tauri AT03 cooling panel comparison Meanwhile at the rear of the car the engine covers bodywork was expanded. This not only increased the size of the rear cooling outlet but also resulted in a larger rear deck upon which the air flowed to the rear of the car. Alfa Romeo has been proactive in the closing stages of the season as it not only looks to fend off the challenge posed by Aston Martin but also invest in designs that will carry across to its 2023 challenger. And whilst not a new feature having been used at other high downforce venues the larger rear wing endplate tip cutout used in Mexico is a feature worthy of our attention owing to its impact on the resultant tip vortex being generated. Alfa Romeo C42 rear wing cutout comparison Photo by Giorgio Piola Compared with the medium downforce wings cutout inset theres a clear difference in approach with its high downforce arrangement as the flap is undercut red arrow. This is the result of the team looking for a better tradeoff between the downforce and drag being generated given it is trying to maintain as much wingspan as possible. The team has also made changes to the forward section of the floor over the course of the last two races as it looks to increase the downforce being generated and its working range. This includes changes to the outermost floor fence and the point at which it connects with the side of the chassis.
The last time a Formula 1 team fell out with a TV broadcaster, https://www.planetf1.com/news/formula-1-team-tv-broadcaster-fallout/, Max Verstappen and Red Bull pressed mute on broadcaster Sky Sports in Mexico although it was not the first example of a media spat in Formula 1. Then postrace Sky used mixedzone interviews with Verstappen and his teammate Sergio Perez while Red Bull team principal Christian Horner who usually appears for an interview at every round did not do so. But this year its been a constant yeah kind of like daily being disrespectful especially one particular person said Verstappen. Renault had previously blocked the Dutch broadcaster from onetoone access with Daniel Ricciardo as they reportedly wanted to ask the Australian if Verstappen was better than him. Read more Christian Horner discusses decision to support Max Verstappens Sky F1 boycott, Max Verstappen and Red Bull pressed mute on broadcaster Sky Sports in Mexico although it was not the first example of a media spat in Formula 1. Word surfaced that Verstappen had taken issue with Sky Sports coverage relating to one individual at the broadcaster in particular believed to be their pitlane reporter Ted Kravitz who on several occasions had used the word robbed when discussing how Lewis Hamilton had missed out on the 2021 title to Verstappen. With Red Bull said to have joined in Verstappens silence multiple occurrences during Skys Mexican Grand Prix race coverage suggested that was true starting with Martin Brundles grid walk when he had the opportunity to approach Red Bulls design chief Adrian Newey but did not. Then postrace Sky used mixedzone interviews with Verstappen and his teammate Sergio Perez while Red Bull team principal Christian Horner who usually appears for an interview at every round did not do so. Verstappen postrace confirmed his stance and explained it. It had nothing to do with this weekend. But this year its been a constant yeah kind of like daily being disrespectful especially one particular person said Verstappen. And its enough I dont accept it. You cant live in the past. You just have to move on. Social media is a very toxic place and if you are constantly being like that live on TV you make it only worse instead of trying to make it better. You keep disrespecting me and at one point Im not tolerating it anymore. Thats why I decided to stop answering them. Horner has said Verstappen and the Red Bull team will be talking to Sky at the next event the Sao Paulo Grand Prix so bar any further fallouts that should be the end of the matter. But fallouts with the media are not unheard of  just ask Renault. In 2020 Ziggo Sports Jack Plooij issued an apology after he called Renault driver Esteban Ocon a French f on live television while he was interviewing Lando Norris. Ocon accepted the apology although that was not the first time Ziggo Sport had found themselves in hot water with Renault. Renault had previously blocked the Dutch broadcaster from onetoone access with Daniel Ricciardo as they reportedly wanted to ask the Australian if Verstappen was better than him.

Binotto: Mercedes' strategy calls show not only Ferrari make mistakes, https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1016141/1/binotto-mercedes-strategy-calls-show-not-only-ferrari-make-mistakes, Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto whose teams strategy has come under scrutiny several times this season thinks Mercedes threw away two potential victories. Mercedes maybe have lost the last race as well by not choosing the right tyres in Austin. I think we would have still had the edge but they Mercedes would have been a lot closer Horner said. He controlled the race from the very beginning on those soft tyres not warming them up too quickly making sure there was longevity to them he added. But I think that the onestop mediumhard looked like the right strategy., Lewis Hamilton has been forced to settle for runnerup spot behind Red Bulls Max Verstappen at consecutive races in Austin and Mexico City as he missed the chance to end his and Mercedes winless drought in 2022. Hamilton was leading the United States Grand Prix on hard tyres but was overtaken in the closing stages by Verstappen who was running on mediums. Is Hamilton No Longer the Best Wet Weather Driver Video of Is Hamilton No Longer the Best Wet Weather Driver At last weekends Mexico City Grand Prix Mercedes again opted for alternative tactics to Red Bull putting Hamilton on a mediumtohard strategy in the belief that raceleader Verstappen would not be able to go to the end on his set of mediums having started the race on softs. Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto whose teams strategy has come under scrutiny several times this season thinks Mercedes threw away two potential victories. In Hungary we have been criticised and its normally when we are doing things which are not completely right we are criticised he said. Mercedes maybe have lost the last race as well by not choosing the right tyres in Austin. So I think its not only down to us somehow to make different choices or making mistakes. Binotto said it was always clear to Ferrari that running a softtomedium strategy was the best way to go in Mexico. We saw that there was not much degradation on the soft or sufficient to run a onestop softmedium and we went for it he explained. Certainly then in the race we had as well to manage our tyres to make sure that were surviving on a onestop and that maybe as well is part of the cause of our slow pace of today. So managing tyres has been certainly an item a subject for us today. But still we believe that softmedium was the right choice for the race. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner also took a swipe at rivals Mercedes revealing his surprise at their tyre strategy. I think we would have still had the edge but they Mercedes would have been a lot closer Horner said. You could hear their drivers were not very happy about the hard tyre and thats the second weekend in a row that theyve put that tyre on and its cost them a victory so I was quite surprised at that. Horner also praised Verstappens tyremanagement describing it as masterful. He controlled the race from the very beginning on those soft tyres not warming them up too quickly making sure there was longevity to them he added. Actually when they came off the car there was still a lot of life left in them. That gave us even more confidence that the medium tyre would be fine as a onestop. It was a question of not abusing that tyre which is something he has been masterful at this year. Mercedes admit tactical error Both Hamilton and teammate George Russell were unhappy with their hard tyres and questioned Mercedes decision in Mexico. After Sundays race Toto Wolff admitted his team made a mistake in hindsight. In hindsight its always easier to judge he said. But I think that the onestop mediumhard looked like the right strategy. That the medium at the end held on for so long came as a surprise. But the hindsight is the thing. If we were to restart the race maybe we would choose a different tyre. Wolff added We felt the soft was strong when we discussed it this morning but not strong enough to really go 30 laps or so. Our models said that a softhard would go. Our models didnt say that a softmedium would go. It could have been to lose more time on the medium and hang it out there for another five six laps and then try to do 30 laps on the soft. But also that was not a given that it would hold on with Daniel you could see that it was possible. Wolff also conceded Mexico likely presented Mercedes with their best chance of winning a race this season. On the simulations it says yes he concluded.
F1 teams discussing winter shutdown to aid staff well-being, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/f1-teams-discussing-winter-shutdown-to-aid-staff-wellbeing/10393665/, Although all teams do ensure staff members get time off over Christmas and through the winter there is nothing set in the sporting regulations that requires them to shut down through the offseason. But as part of talks in Formula 1s Sporting Advisory Committee where teams are represented by their sporting directors it has emerged that a winter shutdown has now been proposed. This would see a similar approach be taken to the summer shutdown putting a fixed period in the rules where all teams must pause operations and staff members will get time off. Motorsport.com understands that discussions about a winter shutdown in the Sporting Advisory Committee have not yet reached an advanced stage nor is there total unanimity among the teams. But the indications have been positive according to Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff who felt it would be an important step to protect staff wellbeing., Listen to this article F1 currently has a twoweek shutdown during the summer break that is enshrined in the regulations ensuring staff get time off through the busy season by making teams pause their operations.

But the indications have been positive according to Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff who felt it would be an important step to protect staff wellbeing. There are many of us team principals that would like to replicate what we have in the summer at least starting at Christmas and going into the new year for two weeks explained Wolff. Obviously thats still up for discussion. But there was a positive indication for the wellbeing of the people. Mclaren garage Photo by Erik Junius With the final race of the season scheduled for November 20 in Abu Dhabi this year will mark the earliest finish to a campaign since 2010 when the title showdown was held on November 14. The early finish this year was a result of the FIFA World Cup which starts in Qatar on the same day as the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and will continue until the middle of December. F1 held its last race in December in each of the past three seasons running as late as December 13 in 2020 and December 12 in 2021 after the COVID19 pandemic forced changes to the schedule. With only one preseason test planned in Bahrain next year ahead of the seasonopener on March 5 it is set to be the longest winter break that staff have enjoyed for a number of years. Its great that the season finishes this couple of weeks earlier than in the past because everyone is really at the limit said Wolff. Having this week two weeks more is definitely a nice welcome but on the other side theres many people in the factory who are going to work flat out between Christmas and New Year. But for the race team thats clocking many airline miles thats a positive.

Hamilton: Alonso's comments about F1 titles "make me giggle a little bit", https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/hamilton-alonso-comments-f1-titles-giggle/10393577/, But in an apparent response to Alonsos comments Hamilton tweeted a picture of them on the podium together at Indianapolis in 2007 where Lewis beat Fernando when they were teammates at McLaren accompanied with a single thumbsup emoji. Asked for his reaction to Alonsos comments and about the post Hamilton said I gave you my reaction. It does make me giggle a little bit to be honest but I have tried to be really respectful over the years. Lewis Hamilton McLaren and Fernando Alonso McLaren Photo by Steven Tee  Motorsport ImagesMercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff also brushed off Alonsos comments saying the twotime world champion was a teaser and it was comedy and that he doubted Hamilton cared. It was not the first time there had been some tension emerging from comments Alonso made about Hamilton this year., Listen to this article In an interview with Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf that was published on Saturday Alonso discussed the value of F1 titles won against drivers from other teams compared to those fought only against a teammate. Alonso took to Twitter after the quotes began to circulate to say that all titles are amazing and he was tired of the continuous search for headlines as well as suggesting F1 fans should stop being pitted against each other on social media. But in an apparent response to Alonsos comments Hamilton tweeted a picture of them on the podium together at Indianapolis in 2007 where Lewis beat Fernando when they were teammates at McLaren accompanied with a single thumbsup emoji. Hamilton won that race ahead of Alonso who was left fuming at his McLaren team amid a tense season that resulted in Alonso leaving at the end of the year. Asked for his reaction to Alonsos comments and about the post Hamilton said I gave you my reaction. Thats my thumbs up. I dont really have a lot to say about it. It does make me giggle a little bit to be honest but I have tried to be really respectful over the years. For example when youve ever asked me about who has been the better driver for me Ive always tried to give praise. Its definitely interesting to see the comments that are made but it doesnt really matter. So thats why I just kind of put the thumbs up. Lewis Hamilton McLaren and Fernando Alonso McLaren Photo by Steven Tee  Motorsport Images Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff also brushed off Alonsos comments saying the twotime world champion was a teaser and it was comedy and that he doubted Hamilton cared. It creates headlines and this sport is about headlines said Wolff. Theyre great champions. Alonso likes to throw one in. I dont think its bothering Lewis a millimetre. In the wake of the response to his comments Alonso said on Sunday when asked about Max Verstappens new win record that he would not speak anymore about anyone else because I think theres always misunderstanding. It was not the first time there had been some tension emerging from comments Alonso made about Hamilton this year. Following their collision on the opening lap of the Belgian Grand Prix in August Alonso called Hamilton an idiot over team radio and claimed the seventime world champion could only race starting first. He later apologised for the comment.

I think we understand more now what it is where we got it wrong with the car. We can almost trace it back to a single decision last October Wolff told Sky Sports F1 as he assessed the W13s difficult start to life and its development since. Wolff said the key issue stemmed from Mercedes misjudging their ride height windowPushed on what that decision was Wolff pointed to the cars floor and ride height saying We thought we could run on the deck but you cant Despite Mercedes struggles Hamilton and new team mate George Russell have made plenty of podium appearances, Toto Wolff believes a development call some 12 months ago was the moment Mercedes got it wrong with the development of their 2022 car as he reflected on the teams efforts to bring the W13 up to speed. Mercedes entered F1s new era of technical regulations off the back of eight successive constructors titles but trouble adapting to the changes  spearheaded by ground effect aerodynamics  has seen them relinquish their crown. READ MORE We know where we need to improve says Hamilton after P2 in Mexico With Red Bull and Ferrari stealing a march on the competition Mercedes have spent most of the season trying to claw back performance and understand the root cause of their struggles which included extreme porpoising early on. I think we understand more now what it is where we got it wrong with the car. We can almost trace it back to a single decision last October Wolff told Sky Sports F1 as he assessed the W13s difficult start to life and its development since.

Following on from a pair of secondplace finishes with Lewis Hamilton in the United States and Mexico aided by the latest batch in a long line of car updates Mercedes Trackside Engineering Director Andrew Shovlin added some context when asked exactly what Wolff meant by his comments. READ MORE Russell takes positives from Mercedes performance despite frustrating P4 finish at Mexico City GP What I can imagine he was talking about is weve been doing a lot of experiments and trying things at race weekends in order to learn and to refine our development direction going forward said Shovlin. Over the course of this last month weve increased those experiments and the result of that is weve understood some issues with where we developed the car early on and now were going back 12 months ago what we were doing before the car even turned a wheel.

Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen find agreement as F1 stars slam "keyboard warriors", https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/verstappen-hamilton-social-media-abuse-28375178, The rivalry between the two racers last season had the unfortunate sideeffect of fuelling tribalism on social media which has led to countless examples of people directing hate and abuse towards those who support the other. Earlier this year the FIA and F1 launched their Drive It Out campaign in a bid to tackle the problem. Social media is a very toxic place and if you are constantly being like that on live TV you make it only worse instead of trying to make it better in the world. Image Getty Images Getty ImagesAsked for his own thoughts on the subject Hamilton said Mental health is such a prominent thing right now. And just in general the social media world is getting far too toxic., Online abuse is on the rise in Formula 1 as with other parts of society often fuelled by tribalism which has grown in the wake of the rivalry between Hamilton and Verstappen Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton came together to call out the online trolls who have grown in number in the Formula 1 world in recent times. The rivalry between the two racers last season had the unfortunate sideeffect of fuelling tribalism on social media which has led to countless examples of people directing hate and abuse towards those who support the other. And it is certainly not limited to those two racers nor is it limited only online. Earlier this year the FIA and F1 launched their Drive It Out campaign in a bid to tackle the problem. Speaking in Mexico this weekend amid Red Bulls boycott of Sky Sports interviews over perceived bias against them Verstappen suggested comments made on TV help to fuel the haters online. At some point its enough I dont accept it. You cant live in the past you just have to move on said the Dutchman.  Social media is a very toxic place and if you are constantly being like that on live TV you make it only worse instead of trying to make it better in the world. Later asked to expand his thoughts on those social media trolls he added  I think its just the sport is more popular so there are more people watching so more people are writing. I think its just that. Its not great that they are allowed to write these kinds of things so I hope we can come up with a kind of algorithm that stops people from being keyboard warriors. These kind of people... they will never come up to you and say these things in front of your face because theyre sitting in front of their desk or whatever at home being upset being frustrated and they can write whatever they like because the platform allows you to. Yeah that can be really damaging and hurtful to some people and its not how it should be. Image Getty Images Getty Images Asked for his own thoughts on the subject Hamilton said Mental health is such a prominent thing right now. I know so many people reading their comments and the stuff that people say and it is hurtful. Fortunately I dont read that stuff but the media platforms definitely need to do more to protect people particularly young kids and women. But at the moment theyre not doing that so I think it will just continue. And Sergio Perez added Its a shame how are these people can feel how they feel because you are just a public figure and they feel they can insult you insult your family and just sitting behind the desk they dont understand that we are also human beings. And I think this has got to stop. Obviously as a sport we need to also be responsible of what we post by ourselves. We all have a lot of followers so its very important that we try to get the sport in the right way because Formula 1 its a great sport and has great values but has to do more in that regard. And just in general the social media world is getting far too toxic.

We were upset and we made the decision to stand together as a team. It wont have done Sky any harm for us to lay down a marker. Some of the commentary is fair but some pieces are sensationalist and saying we robbed anyone of the championship as was said in Austin is going too far. It is not impartial or fair or balanced. We have said our piece and will go back to normal next race. What did Ted Kravitz say After the F1 United States Grand Prix he said Lewis Hamilton doesnt win a race all year and then finally comes back at a track where he could win the first race all year battling the same guy who won the race he was robbed in the previous year and manages to finish ahead of him. What a script and a story that would have been. But thats not the way the script turned out today was it Because the guy that beat him after being robbed actually overtook him because hes got a quicker car because of engineering and Formula One and design and pretty much because of Adrian Newey Red Bulls chief technical officer over there. What was Max Verstappens response Its been a constant kind of like digging being disrespectful especially one particular person  and at one point it is enough I dont accept it.

That along with American Logan Sargeant falling just one lap shy of a Super License point lead the dayafter leftovers from a busy F1 Mexican Grand Prix. Autoweek rounds up some of the key talking points from Mexico City American Logan Sargeant Falls One Lap Short Logan Sargeant completed 96 km in a Formula 1 practice session in Mexico City. ATPImages Getty Images Florida native Logan Sargeant returned to Williams FW44 for his second practice run in a week amid the Americans impending 2023 Formula 1 debut. Under Formula 1 regulations a young driver receives a Super License point if they complete a clean 100 km 62 miles during practice. However due to red flags caused by other drivers during a Friday FP1 practice session with Williams in Mexico City Sargeant amassed just 96 kmmeaning he fell one lap short. Nonetheless Sargeant is on a healthy 30 points and is in line to comfortably reach the 40point threshold if he has a smooth final Formula 2 weekend in Abu Dhabi. And he is still learning. Williams has said that Sergeant will replace Nicholas Latifiif Sargeant can complete is Super License requirement. I was definitely a lot more comfortable said Sargeant after his session. Everything slowed down a lot and it was easier to build a rhythm and learn the track. All in all it was a good step forward and good progress from last weekend in Austin. Chinas 2023 F1 Hosting Hopes Fading The pandemic has kept Formula 1 from China since 2019. Charles Coates Getty Images China has not featured on Formula 1s calendar since 2019 due to the pandemic and the countrys Covid Zero policyto which Chinese president Xi Jinping recently recommitted means it effectively remains cutoff from the remainder of the world. There are still strict entry measures and quarantine which is currently immutable for Formula 1. Next years event is scheduled for April 16 but it is understood that it is an unlikely proposition. In the case that such a scenario unfolds. Formula 1 would not replace China reducing the calendar from 24 to 23 Grands Prix which still remains a record. One schedule change should China fall off the calendar would be for Azerbaijan scheduled for April 30 to move one week earlier. That would avoid having Azerbaijan and Miami race on backtoback weekends. Few in the paddock are looking forward to that backtoback scheduling. Hamiltons Little Alonso Dig Lewis Hamilton is not one to get shortchanged on social media. Eric Alonso Getty Images Fernando Alonso has taken to making sly remarks at some of his opponents across the years and in an interview with Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf he suggested that Max Verstappens two titles were worthier than Lewis Hamiltons seven. Once the headline was out Alonso made an attempt to clarify his comments insisting drivers shouldnt be compared but Hamilton got his dig at Alonso with a very cheeky post on Twitter. This content is imported from Twitter. You may be able to find the same content in another format or you may be able to find more information at their web site. It does make me giggle a little bit to be honest but I have tried to be really respectful over the years and for example when youve ever asked me about who has been the better driver for me Ive always tried to give praise said Hamilton when asked about the post. But its definitely interesting to see the comments that are made but it doesnt really matter. So thats why I just kind of put the thumbs up. De Vries Gets Abu Dhabi Test Nyck de Vries practices with Mercedes in Mexico City. Jam Media Getty Images Nyck de Vries has been a busy man. De Vries has fulfilled young driver duties for employers Mercedes Aston Martin and Williams had a private outing with Alpine and also made an impressive lastminute race debut for Williams which captured the attention of AlphaTauri. With Mercedes having released de Vries for 2023 AlphaTauri will run de Vries for a full day at the postseason young driver test in Abu Dhabi on November 22. That means De Vries will end up driving for half of the 10 teams in a window of around three months. Too Busy Mexico City Paddock Lewis Hamilton center makes his way through a crowded paddock in Mexico City. Peter J Fox Getty Images Drivers and the FIA are set to talk at the next briefing in Brazil over paddock overcrowding. Formula 1s popularity has ballooned in recent years but there were more than a few occasions of drivers being seriously accosted when trying to manoeuvre their way around what remains a work environment. Drivers are cognizant of the need to satisfy fans but frequently in Mexico City especially among the leading contingent they were mobbed. Several spoke afterward of the need for fans particularly adults to respect boundaries with security having been tightened due to the situation. Mexico Citys paddock is one of the most vibrant and enthusiastic of the campaign but for 2023 there will surely be some additional measures put in place.
Vesti tipped for Mercedes F1 run in Abu Dhabi young driver test, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/frederik-vesti-mercedes-f1-test-run-abu-dhabi-young-driver/10393523/, Mercedes has a rookie slot available because Nyck de Vries has been released to drive for AlphaTauri as recently confirmed by Franz Tost the Faenza outfits boss. Vesti was announced as a Mercedes junior driver in January 2021 and he is the most qualified candidate in the Stuttgart manufacturers programme. A day in the W13 will provide Vesti with valuable experience of the real car and help with correlation.

He lies eighth in the championship with just the Abu Dhabi finale to come and is only nine points shy of fourth place., Listen to this article The test will feature two cars per team with race drivers running with the definitive 2023 Pirelli tyres in one car and rookies  defined as those with no more than two Grand Prix starts  in the other. Mercedes has a rookie slot available because Nyck de Vries has been released to drive for AlphaTauri as recently confirmed by Franz Tost the Faenza outfits boss. Vesti was announced as a Mercedes junior driver in January 2021 and he is the most qualified candidate in the Stuttgart manufacturers programme. Giving him a run in the W13 would be a logical move as he has already been doing some simulator running for the team in Brackley and is set to do more in 2023 as both de Vries and occasional sim driver Stoffel Vandoorne are leaving the Mercedes camp. A day in the W13 will provide Vesti with valuable experience of the real car and help with correlation. The 20yearold has an impressive CV. A star in karting he progressed quickly through Danish Formula Ford and both the Danish and ADAC F4 series finishing fourth in the latter in 2018. Frederik Vesti ART Grand Prix Photo by FIA Formula 2 He won the inaugural Formula Regional European Championship in 2019 with Prema before moving to FIA F3 with the same team in 2020 as team mate to Oscar Piastri and Logan Sargeant. That year he scored three feature race wins and finished fourth in the championship behind Piastri Theo Pourchaire and Sargeant. Having attracted Mercedes support he moved to ART for his second F3 season in 2021 It was a less productive season overall with just one race win although he again finished fourth in the championship. This season he moved up to F2 with ART. He won the sprint race in Baku and has this far logged four other podiums including second places in both the sprint and feature events at Monza last month. He lies eighth in the championship with just the Abu Dhabi finale to come and is only nine points shy of fourth place.

Why Red Bull F1 Team Boycotted Sky TV During the Mexican Grand Prix Weekend, https://www.autoweek.com/racing/formula-1/a41821690/why-red-bull-f1-team-boycotted-sky-tv-during-the-mexico-grand-prix-weekend/, Theres needle between one of Formula 1s biggest broadcasters and the reigning twotime World Champion. Red Bull took umbrage at some comments made on U.K.based Sky TV during the U.S. Grand Prix Austin weekend in which reporter Ted Kravitz said Lewis Hamilton had been robbed of the 2021 title. As a result Red Bull representatives did not talk to Sky reporters even in the FIAcontrolled TV pen and that extended not just to Sky U.K. personnel but also representatives from Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia. So we thought this weekend wed just take a break and it wouldnt do Sky any harm. It doesnt feel fair or balanced.Horner confirmed that the blackout between Red Bull and Sky was only for Mexico City and normal service will be resumed in Sao Paulo., Theres needle between one of Formula 1s biggest broadcasters and the reigning twotime World Champion. Red Bull took umbrage at some comments made on U.K.based Sky TV during the U.S. Grand Prix Austin weekend in which reporter Ted Kravitz said Lewis Hamilton had been robbed of the 2021 title. That was effectively the last straw in a lengthy buildup of tension between team and broadcaster because of the ways last years notorious title decider has been frequently referenced. As a result Red Bull representatives did not talk to Sky reporters even in the FIAcontrolled TV pen and that extended not just to Sky U.K. personnel but also representatives from Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia. The TV pen is set up into around seven zones in the Formula 1 paddock and each major broadcaster has their own area with drivers usually visiting each section. DeFodi Images Getty Images This year its been a constant kind of like digging being disrespectful especially one particular person said twotime F1 champion Max Verstappen. And at one point its enough you know I dont accept it. You cant live in the past you just have to move on. At the moment social media is a very toxic place. And if you are constantly being like that live on TV you make it only worse instead of trying to make it better in the world. You keep disrespecting me and one point Im not tolerating it anymore so thats why I decided to stop answering. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said that the decision to stop talking to Sky was taken just to register our discontent and that we were disappointed with a series of derogatory comments. So we thought this weekend wed just take a break and it wouldnt do Sky any harm. There needs to be balance in commentary and some of the commentary is excellent but some of the pieces theres too much sensationalism being done and we stand together as a team. I think accusations of championships being robbed we dont feel is impartial commentary. It doesnt feel fair or balanced. Horner confirmed that the blackout between Red Bull and Sky was only for Mexico City and normal service will be resumed in Sao Paulo.

Even though there is a stark contrast between Formula 1 drivers zooming 200 mph and golfers taking 5 hours to play a round the science and engineering behind the equipment both sports use is more similar than you might think. For starters both sports adhere to strict rules set forth by governing bodies. In Formula 1s case that is FIA Fdration Internationale de lAutomobile in golf rulesmaking duties are shared by the USGA United States Golf Association and RA Royal  Ancient. FIA and USGA regulate their respective sports FIAUSGA The biggest contrast between the two sports regulations is that golfs rules are universal i.e. they apply to any competition regardless of skill level in any professional or amateur event while F1 rules apply only to that specific league. F1 regulations are also constantly shifting based on technology while golfs base rules have been around for longer than automobiles have existed. These regulations force engineers to look for any possible advantage written within the rules to create a legal advantage versus other teams. In the case of golf each manufacturer has its own philosophy when it comes to designing equipment geared toward their stable of players just as some F1 cars are tuned to driving styles. Aerodynamics play a huge part in design Formula One  FIA One of the best comparisons from golf to F1 is how some teams prioritize straightline speed vs. cornering in the same way some golf OEMs put a priority on forgiveness vs. trying to create extra workability. Engineers in both sports have to strike the perfect balance of which attributes they believe are going to offer the most competitive edge. The advantage golf club engineers have is they can segment their designs to fit various demographics of golfers Formula 1 engineers meanwhile can design only one car. The hypercompetitive nature of golf and Formula 1 has engineers and designers keeping ideas close to their vests and constantly pushing the limits to find performance within the rules. In both sports engineers will go as far as looking beyond the wording of regulations to find different interpretations of how the rules are written. In golf this process is cut and dry  a piece of equipment is either conforming or nonconforming but that doesnt mean engineers wont get a little weird. Ping Doc17 putter Ping Golf The Ping Doc17 to this day is one of the wildest examples of a putter that pushed the rules to the absolute limit. The 17 in Doc17 represents the length of the face from heel to toe in centimeters. The USGA limit is set at 17.78 cm but Doc17 sounds way better than Doc17.78. Formula 1 engineers get a little more outside of the box. An example of this is how Aston Martin redesigned their rear wing based on the radii set within the regulations. Aston Martins modified 2022 rear wing design Formula One There is a whole bunch of stuff going on here but in the simplest terms by continuing the radius of the side wing to create a round rail Aston Martin kept the top of the side wing whole compared to others that have a small channel that flows down to connect to the car. Ferraris F1 rear wing design Giorgio Piola Just like how every improved mishit helps keep a golf ball online every partial second gained per lap in a 190mile F1 race adds up and can be the difference between being in the points the top 10 in F1 and going home with nothing. Lastly just as golfers tune their equipment to different course styles and ground conditions F1 races are conducted all over the world meaning tweaks need to be made to the car the same way golfers need to adjust club selection at altitude. The recent Mexico Grand Prix held in Mexico City was well above sea level and the less dense air had cars traveling faster for the same reason a golf ball travels farther  less air resistance equals more output for the same input. Now if we could only get PGA Tour players to finish a round in the same time it takes an F1 driver to complete 190 miles we might find a way to pick up the pace of play.

Russell drove “too cautiously” in first lap F1 battle with Hamilton, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/russell-drove-too-cautiously-in-first-lap-f1-battle-with-hamilton/10393277/, Russell started second but after giving space to Hamilton he emerged from the opening sequence of corners on the first lap in fourth place a position he still held at the end of the race. I knew I wouldnt have been able to overtake Max Verstappen on the outside said Russell when asked by Autosport about his first lap. But having Lewis on the inside I didnt want to be too aggressive obviously him being my teammate. Id like to think it would have been the same had it been the other way around. So the soft should have been a medium the medium should have been the hard and the hard was like an ultra hard effectively., Russell started second but after giving space to Hamilton he emerged from the opening sequence of corners on the first lap in fourth place a position he still held at the end of the race. The Briton admitted that recent frustrations including his first corner collision with Carlos Sainz in Austin encouraged him to take a careful approach especially when battling with his teammate. I knew I wouldnt have been able to overtake Max Verstappen on the outside said Russell when asked by Autosport about his first lap. But having Lewis on the inside I didnt want to be too aggressive obviously him being my teammate. And ultimately that that cost me and caused me to lose two positions. So ultimately if I had managed to maintain position I probably would have finished second today. Asked if he would have given the same space to anyone other than his teammate Russell said Yeah I think it was more in Turn 1 to be honest I would have ordinarily just chopped across or in Turn 2 I would have run the driver wide. So yeah thats the way the game works sometimes. Id like to think it would have been the same had it been the other way around. Maybe maybe not Im not too sure. But Ive had a bit of a scrappy last three races on my behalf too many incidents too many mistakes. And that was probably a factor of taking it too cautiously. And theres a balance in there somewhere. George Russell Mercedes W13 Photo by Mark Sutton  Motorsport Images Russell admitted to some frustration about the strategy he ran in Mexico. Early in the race he indicated that he wanted to run long on his opening set of mediums and then switch to softs a choice used very successfully by Daniel Ricciardo. However not long after that message he mirrored Hamiltons strategy by going to hards. Lots of positives to take away from the weekend he said. It would have also been interesting to see how we performed had we started on the soft and gone to the medium or even if we extended the medium and went to the soft at the end. That was what I was pushing for in the car. Everythings easier in hindsight. Expanding on the strategy choice he said There was no real thought about starting on the soft but there was definitely a thought of extending the medium and going into the soft. Im not too sure I think we reacted to Nicholas Latifi and Lewis they both put the hard on and were setting green sectors everywhere. But the hard tyre just did not work from lap two onwards. I think generally this weekend Pirelli brought too hard a compound. So the soft should have been a medium the medium should have been the hard and the hard was like an ultra hard effectively. So seeing Ricciardos performance is a little bit disappointing as well because I really felt like I could have continued on that medium at a good pace and we would have been flying at the end on that soft. Russell made it clear on the radio that he wasnt happy with the hard tyres but there was nothing that the team could do. In the end he made a late extra stop just to secure fastest lap. I dont think there was so much frustration as such he said. Youre just trying to put your point across and when youre out there its physically demanding and theres a lot going on and youre struggling with the car and it may come across in that way. But I was trying to get my point across. I felt good on the medium. The pace was looking strong before Lewis pitted I was closing the gap. When I was in the lead I was setting personal bests. As I said its so easy in hindsight and perhaps we should have recognised that there was no way I would have been able to overtake Checo with the hard tyre and the only way would have been to put a soft.
Daniel Ricciardo calls for "maturity and respect" from Formula 1 paddock guests, https://www.planetf1.com/news/daniel-ricciardo-paddock-guests-respect/, After a number of drivers complained about the behaviour of some guests in the Mexican Grand Prix paddock Daniel Ricciardo has called for rules for those allowed into the inner circle. Pierre Gasly reported he felt mobbed by fans in the paddock and even had a stranger open his bag. I like having an atmosphere in the paddock I think it should be a fun place to be. Adults need to act like adults.Andreas Seidl warns against overreactionHowever Ricciardos team boss Andreas Seidl has warned against an overreaction. Im sure we will find solutions and we can keep enjoying this new atmosphere we have in the paddock throughout the world., After a number of drivers complained about the behaviour of some guests in the Mexican Grand Prix paddock Daniel Ricciardo has called for rules for those allowed into the inner circle. Formula 1 was racing at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez this past weekend Max Verstappen taking victory in what can only be described as an amphitheatre of excitement. Mexican fans are well known for the atmosphere they create but at times it was a bit too much. Pierre Gasly reported he felt mobbed by fans in the paddock and even had a stranger open his bag. Letting people in is fine but its true I feel like some guests sometimes are not really respecting the space we need he said. And people are coming into garages before qualifying and asking for pictures when they are not even from our team. We are working here and obviously we give time to the fans when we can. I know this weekend I didnt dare come out of the hospitality because otherwise you just know you will get mobbed. Sometimes it gets quite hectic because I arrived at the hospitality with my bag with my passport inside open and I didnt even feel it. Adults need to act like adults Ricciardos solution is for a set of guidelines to be written out and paddock guests to be made aware of the rules inside the paddock. While the Australian enjoys the atmosphere in the paddock he says there should be boundaries. To be honest this year has got more hectic he told The Race. I think there are two sides to it. The paddock used to lack atmosphere. I remember eight years ago 10 years ago the paddock was actually a pretty dull place. I like having an atmosphere in the paddock I think it should be a fun place to be. But there should also be boundaries. I think to be in the paddock and have a VIP pass its a privilege. And I think you also should act with some maturity and have respect. That hasnt always been shown this year. People lose their minds. If they set some guidelines maybe that helps because there isnt that at the moment. If its just a bit of awareness maybe they will be a little more cool. I dont want to see it change. Adults need to act like adults. Andreas Seidl warns against overreaction However Ricciardos team boss Andreas Seidl has warned against an overreaction. Formula 1 has often in the past been criticised for being out of reach for the fans the sport keeping its distance from the masses. Today under Liberty Media it is more accessible the owners trying to engage with fans wherever possible. The direction Formula 1 took is definitely the right one and a good one said the McLaren team principal. I appreciate a lot the atmosphere that is around now in the paddocks throughout the season. Here its clearly too extreme. And I think we just need to follow up and have a good discussion with Formula 1 how we can make sure that especially in countries like here in Mexico where the fans are also passionate for what we are doing and so enthusiastic we just always keep the right level of respect. Im sure we will find solutions and we can keep enjoying this new atmosphere we have in the paddock throughout the world.

We have to see what he wants to do in the future.Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff had been spotted wearing Ricciardos merchandise but denied that it hinting towards a linkup., The McLaren driver enjoyed a rare positive outing in 2022 at the F1 Mexico City Grand Prix finishing in P7 but has just two races remaining with his future unclear. Ricciardos contract with McLaren will be terminated a year early and he wont be in the F1 2023 driver lineup but has been linked to a reserve driver role at Mercedes. Daniel Ricciardo  WHERE NEXT  F1 2022 Video of Daniel Ricciardo  WHERE NEXT  F1 2022 Yeah it would be interesting Russell said to Sky about Ricciardo joining. Id like to see that. We have to see what he wants to do in the future. Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff had been spotted wearing Ricciardos merchandise but denied that it hinting towards a linkup. I am promoting his merch Honestly I just like it Wolff said. They took a photo of me and posted it online. Ricciardo teased I gave George a sweater. Toto messaged saying he really liked it so I gave him one too Vacant seats with Alpine Haas and Williams have passed without Ricciardo signing up. He said about his limited options If there was a lot Id probably be in a race seat. But there is enough to keep me interested. I want to stay active to some degree. Im aware that doing nothing for a year is not good. Ricciardo claimed I honestly dont know which team he will join in 2023 but the plan was to remain in F1 albeit not in a race seat. I am talking to teams he said. I still want to keep a foot in the door for 2024. Seeing the lights go out for race one I will have an itch Ricciardo sits 12th in the F1 standings after being comprehensively outperformed by teammate Lando Norris all year. He will be replaced by rookie Oscar Piastri next season. The last two years have been quite hard he admitted. You put a lot in and when it doesnt come back it can get you down. I know the value of a summer break. Stepping away can give you a different perspective. The season is pretty relentless you dont get a chance to rebuild. I truly believe it will be a blessing in disguise. I can confidently say that I wont be on the grid behind a wheel. But I still want to be in the sport working with a team. Still with the ambition to be back on the grid in 2024. Thats where my head is at. Time away from a race seat will do me good. Im not done. But it will look different.
Max Verstappen sets F1 season wins record with 14th victory, https://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/max-verstappen-sets-f1-season-wins-record-with-14th-victory-1.6131929, MEXICO CITY It quickly became clear this would be the season that Max Verstappen set the record for most wins in a Formula One season. Verstappen set the F1 record for wins in a season Sunday at the Mexico City Grand Prix with his 14th victory of the season. Paired with wins at Miami Montreal and now Mexico City Verstappen swept the North American portion of this years F1 schedule. I try to win races and that is the most important thing. The team has won 16 of 21 F1 races this season with Verstappen and Sergio Perez winner at Monaco and Singapore., MEXICO CITY  It quickly became clear this would be the season that Max Verstappen set the record for most wins in a Formula One season. It was never a question of if the Dutchman would win 14 races. It was only a question of when. And now By how much will Verstappen ultimately shatter the mark he shared with Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel Verstappen set the F1 record for wins in a season Sunday at the Mexico City Grand Prix with his 14th victory of the season. It broke the record set by Schumacher in 2004 and tied by Vettel it 2013. Verstappen only shared the mark with the Germans for all of one week following his victory last Sunday at Circuit of the Americas in Texas. Paired with wins at Miami Montreal and now Mexico City Verstappen swept the North American portion of this years F1 schedule. Just another day for Verstappen. I was never really interested in stats Verstappen said. I always just live in the moment. I try to do the best I can every single weekend. I try to win races and that is the most important thing. I am not that interested in keeping up with every stat. It is amazing season and we are happy to be winning. Verstappen retained his F1 world championship with four races remaining in the season clinched the constructors championship for Red Bull with three races remaining in the season and has two races left to thoroughly demolish the winsinaseason record. Red Bull has won nine consecutive races tying the team record set in 2013. The team has won 16 of 21 F1 races this season with Verstappen and Sergio Perez winner at Monaco and Singapore. Lewis Hamilton finished second for the second consecutive week. He might have had a shot at his first win of the season but Mercedes made the wrong call on a tire change that gave Verstappen control. We didnt choose the right tire strategy in hindsight Hamilton said. Nonetheless to be this close to Red Bull makes me very proud of my team. Were getting closer to the front and we will continue to push. The last couple of races weve taken a big step forward with the car and I hope we will continue like this for the final two. Perez finished third on his home track for the second consecutive year  earning deafening cheers even though a Mexican driver has yet to win at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez. Perez has been mobbed by adoring fans all week in his return. It began with a demonstration run in his hometown of Guadalajara before he arrived at the circuit where Perez has been swarmed by crowds as soon as he enters the paddock. He had to use a back route to get to the Red Bull garage each ontrack session as drivers and teams complained most of the weekend that the spectators who had purchased paddock access were too aggressive. But the fans love their native driver and before the race Perez took a ride around the track on the back of a convertible Volkswagen. He often held his hand to his heart to show his appreciation to the 120000plus fans. Its been incredible honestly Perez told the crowd in Spanish after the race. Thank you for all the support youve given me this weekend. Youre incredible the best fan base. Thank you. The threeday weekend sold out in two minutes earlier this year and the threeday crowd of 395902 broke the mark set last year of 371779. F1 also said ahead of the race that it had extended its contract with the race  often voted most popular among fans  through 2025. The day belonged to Verstappen who started from the pole and won for the 34th time in his career. He held the lead at the start as Hamilton passed teammate George Russell for second and Perez also made it past Russell. Hamilton might have raced for the win and was the leader when he pitted and Mercedes chose the harder more durable tire compound. Verstappen had a softer and faster tire and Hamilton lacked the speed to challenge for the victory. Hamilton has two more chances to avoid the first winless season of his career. Pierre Gassly meanwhile earned another two penalty points for running Lance Stroll wide off track and the Frenchman is now one penalty point away from a onerace suspension.
'I felt fast but once again Car 14 stops' – Alonso frustrated after fifth DNF of the season in Mexico | Formula 1�, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.i-felt-fast-but-once-again-car-14-stops-alonso-frustrated-after-fifth-dnf-of.5DJ8dYBebtwT5Q05yxzDGg.html, Having seen strong points slip away on each occasion the Spaniard was left frustrated at the recurring reliability issues. Car 14 stops before the chequered flag so I think now we lost about 70 points Alonso said. Alonso frustrated after another failure I felt fast today but once again car 14 stopsWe are still happy with our strategy of pushing hard and having a car that performs. He did well to bring the car home in eighth place and score some valuable points for the team. Im confident we can rectify these issues going into the final two races of the season., The sight of Fernando Alonso punching the air in frustration alongside his stricken car is one that will stick out from the race in Mexico as his time with Alpine nears its end. Alonso was running a competitive seventh when he started to suffer from a loss of power and eventually had to retire his car at Turn 1 inside the final 10 laps to register his third retirement in five races. Having seen strong points slip away on each occasion the Spaniard was left frustrated at the recurring reliability issues. Car 14 stops before the chequered flag so I think now we lost about 70 points Alonso said. But its pointless to talk about this once more so lets see. Only two races to go and then a new chapter. MONDAY MORNING DEBRIEF How cunning strategy allowed us to see Ricciardo back at his best in Mexico I think Austin and Mexico have been the best races from a personal point of view. Pacewise I was like 20 seconds or something like that ahead of the McLarens and my team mate. I felt fast but once again Car 14 stops. Alonso was running in seventh before he stopped on track with an issue Team mate Ocon did gain a position as a result of Alonsos misfortune but then was unable to keep Daniel Ricciardo at bay late on. With a 10second time penalty hanging over the McLaren driver Ricciardo was able to pull enough of a gap to retain seventh place after his punishment was handed out leaving Ocon in eighth. I think we didnt put everything together but we fought hard the whole way Ocon said. Damage limitation I would call it. Obviously we lost Fernando we were supposed to have a doublepoints finish. READ MORE Verstappen makes F1 history as he beats Hamilton to victory in Mexico for 14th win of the season I was managing the cooling issue we were having a lot and thats mainly why we lost to Daniel. Happy for him on one side but not happy on the other side because we lost out as a team. So damage limitation well keep fighting in the last two rounds. Reliability has arguably been Alpines biggest weakness this season but Ocon is comfortable with the tradeoff of chasing performance first and foremost. Alonso frustrated after another failure I felt fast today but once again car 14 stops We are still happy with our strategy of pushing hard and having a car that performs. The pace was good when we didnt have to manage so much so it was solid in that regard. Its a stance echoed by Team Principal Otmar Szafnauer who was unhappy at losing Alonso late on but believes Alpine can find fixes for their problems ahead of the penultimate round in Brazil. FACTS AND STATS Verstappen sets new season records for points and wins Unfortunately Fernando suffered a cylinder failure on Lap 52 and he was having to manage on five cylinders  meaning a significant lack of power  to try and remain inside the points Szafnauer said. Eventually the problem was not sustainable and he had to retire the car. Esteban faced a challenge with some cooling issues from quite early on in the race where he had to liftandcoast and therefore he sacrificed significant lap time. He did well to bring the car home in eighth place and score some valuable points for the team. We know reliability is going to be the key in our championship battle and its something that has let us down after showing such a strong level of performance in recent races. Im confident we can rectify these issues going into the final two races of the season.
Alonso feels Alpine is "unprepared" after Mexico F1 reliability woes, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/alonso-feels-alpine-is-unprepared-after-latest-reliability-woe-in-mexico/10393322/, Speaking in the media pen after the race Alonso noted that for car 14 there are always reliability issues referring to his Alpine and said he thought his race had been exceptional up to that point. Fernando Alonso Alpine F1 Team Photo by Zak Mauger  Motorsport ImagesHe added The engine cannot finish the races. The retirement in Mexico marked the fifth time this season Alonso has failed to see the chequered flag. The Spaniard sits 11 points behind Alpine teammate Esteban Ocon in the standings after the Frenchman finished eighth in Mexico. Alonso has just two races remaining with Alpine in F1 before he makes the switch to Aston Martin for the 2023 season., Alonso had been in contention for a points finish at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez only to suffer a cylinder failure while running seventh before an eventual loss of power forced him to retire from the race with six laps remaining. It came as the latest reliability setback for Alonso in what has been a frustrating season that has seen him regularly lament points lost through no fault of his own claiming to have lost more than 60 points over the season. Speaking in the media pen after the race Alonso noted that for car 14 there are always reliability issues referring to his Alpine and said he thought his race had been exceptional up to that point. Its just amazing that only one or two cars retire at every race and there is always car 14 said Alonso. I blew up five engines this year I think. The problem in the qualifying in Australia in Austria I didnt even start the race because of the blackout. So I think in 19 races more or less 50 of the races we havent scored the points we deserve. But theres nothing we can do now. Asked if he thought it was simply a case of bad luck for him Alonso replied No I think we are unprepared. Fernando Alonso Alpine F1 Team Photo by Zak Mauger  Motorsport Images He added The engine cannot finish the races. It cannot be bad luck when you have to change six or seven engines as we did and still not finishing races. I think they have some job to do over the winter hopefully not too much. Renault placed a big emphasis on gaining more performance with the engine for its works F1 team over the winter having long lagged behind rivals Mercedes Ferrari and Honda. While the French manufacturer has made big gains on that front this year it has also suffered more reliability issues  something Alpine technical chief Pat Fry said was a result of a courageous development push. The retirement in Mexico marked the fifth time this season Alonso has failed to see the chequered flag. The Spaniard sits 11 points behind Alpine teammate Esteban Ocon in the standings after the Frenchman finished eighth in Mexico. My level is very high at this point of the season and the standings at the end of the year will be one of the lowest Alonso said. Its a little bit frustrating but theres nothing I can do. Alonso has just two races remaining with Alpine in F1 before he makes the switch to Aston Martin for the 2023 season.

Ahead of the Mexican GP Alonso told Dutch media that Max Verstappens two world titles are worth more than Hamiltons seven because the Red Bull driver has not just beaten his teammate to claim them.

Hamilton responded to the comments on Sunday on social media with a thumbsup emoji alongside a picture of himself standing on the podium with Alonso at the 2007 U.S. Grand Prix when the British driver beat his thenMcLaren teammate to victory.

Ricciardo "didn't plan" to overtake Tsunoda ahead of Mexico F1 clash, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/ricciardo-didnt-plan-to-overtake-tsunoda-ahead-of-mexico-f1-clash/10393312/, Tsunoda driver made it back to the pits but he was forced to retire due to damage incurred. Ricciardo said he wouldnt take full blame for the earlier incident suggesting that Tsunoda could have left him more room. I didnt lock I stayed on the apex truth is I didnt actually plan or want to overtake him there. I mean of course Id love to overtake him I wasnt set into that corner to like outbrake him and overtake him. At that point I didnt really care he said., Listen to this article The pair made contact when Ricciardo made a move on the inside of a tight righthander as they battled for 11th position on the 51st lap. Tsunoda driver made it back to the pits but he was forced to retire due to damage incurred. Ricciardo was soon handed a 10second penalty by the FIA stewards. However his recovery was helped by him being one of the few drivers to switch to soft tyres for the last part of the race. Against the odds he moved up to seventh place by the flag and was far enough ahead of Esteban Ocon that the effect of the penalty was negated. Ricciardo said he wouldnt take full blame for the earlier incident suggesting that Tsunoda could have left him more room. Ive seen a few replays he said. I mean Ill take more of the responsibility but certainly I dont feel it was 100 to zero in terms of my fault. I didnt lock I stayed on the apex truth is I didnt actually plan or want to overtake him there. I mean of course Id love to overtake him I wasnt set into that corner to like outbrake him and overtake him. I just thought if I stay there Its nothing that you probably dont know but all the grips on the inside of that corner. Its very dusty. So I thought if I could just stay there keep him a bit on the dirty line Ill get a better exit. Look we probably needed to give each other 2030 more centimetres and were fine. Probably not even that. I wish it didnt happen and Im sorry that it happened but I think 10 seconds was more than enough and somehow we kind of still came through. Ricciardo admitted that he expected a penalty. Yeah I figured they probably had to do something. But I also its so hard when youre in the heat of battle but I didnt remember locking. With Carlos Sainz in Imola Turn 1 when I went off the apex and slid into him. It didnt feel like that. So I was going to come on the radio and vent a little but I just chose to say nothing. I went pretty dark and then just decided to keep pushing and try to make up for it. Ricciardo said he felt really comfortable once he was on the soft tyre. At that point I didnt really care he said. Because I didnt have that much to lose and as soon as I got out the pits the tyre was like so much better. I could lean on it and I felt like I was in control. So I was like lets just use this tyre see what its got. And then it stayed relatively consistent. So I kind of pushed really hard then just tried to manage it and it was still giving me a lot more pace. Ricciardo also revealed that George Russell might have cost him a position by dropping him within 10 seconds on the pursuing Ocon but a late pit stop by the Mercedes driver saved him. The last few laps I was pretty nervous because George was so close to getting a blue flag for me. And I knew I would lose a couple of seconds with that. And that would have dropped me back into Ocon. So I was pushing like hell just to try and hold that twosecond gap. And then when I heard he pitted for fastest lap  he probably doesnt think it or know it but Ill buy him a beer anyways
Too lenient? What Red Bull's F1 punishment means for 2023 - and 2024, https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DksWk1IN9G80, a, a
Record-breaking Max Verstappen already an F1 great at 25, https://www.espn.com/f1/story/_/id/34916572/record-breaking-max-verstappen-already-f1-great-25, For the now double world champion Max Verstappen his first season of total dominance has come at the relatively young age of 25. With two races remaining in 2022 there is every chance Verstappen raises the bar to 16. More impressively he has won races from lowly grid positions which was rarely the case for the other Vettel and Schumacher. Vettel won all of his 13 races in 2013 from the front row of the grid while Schumacher won 11 of his 13 from the first two grid positions. Like him or not Verstappens performance this year has been truly exceptional., MEXICO CITY  Dominance by a single driver is common in Formula One but that doesnt mean its easy to attain. Many of the greats have enjoyed a season  or multiple seasons  of unbeatable form but the ease with which the victories fall always belies the hard work with which they were achieved. For the now double world champion Max Verstappen his first season of total dominance has come at the relatively young age of 25. By winning the Mexican Grand Prix on Sunday his 14th of the year Verstappen set a new record for race victories in a single season. The previous record of 13 was set in 2004 by Michael Schumacher during his dominant Ferrari years and equaled in 2013 by Sebastian Vettel while driving for Red Bull. With two races remaining in 2022 there is every chance Verstappen raises the bar to 16. Not that the man himself is interested in the numbers. I was never really interested in stats Verstappen said after securing his victory in Mexico. I just live in the moment try to do the best I can every single weekend. I try to win the races  that for me is the most important thing that when I go home I can say to myself that I maximized the performance and if Im close to that Im happy. But a lot in Formula One depends on the whole package and we have a great package right now. Im just enjoying the moment and Im not that interested in keeping in touch with every stat. But of course it has been an amazing season and of course I am very happy winning so many races. Max Verstappen has been almost unbeatable in 2022. Chris GraythenGetty Images As Verstappen has pointed out before comparing records across eras in Formula One is fraught with inconsistencies. Schumacher achieved his 13 wins in an 18race season Vettel scored his in a 19race season and Verstappen secured his first 13 wins of 2022 in 20 race period before taking No. 14 at the 21st race of the year. But while Verstappens season may be statistically less impressive with two races left to run he has arguably had a less dominant car than Schumacher and Vettel enjoyed in their record years. Whats more he has secured a number of his 14 wins in a more spectacular fashion. While the Red Bull is clearly the class of the field at this stage of the season Ferrari was a genuine threat for victories at every race in the early rounds of 2022. Looking at it one way you could argue the Italian team has gifted Verstappen additional wins  most notably in Spain when Charles Leclerc broke down and then in France when Leclerc crashed out of the lead  but the counter argument is that Verstappen has consistently been in a position to take advantage. More impressively he has won races from lowly grid positions which was rarely the case for the other Vettel and Schumacher. Vettel won all of his 13 races in 2013 from the front row of the grid while Schumacher won 11 of his 13 from the first two grid positions. Verstappen however has won six of his 14 from grid positions outside the top two and two of those were from way back in 10th and 14th on the grid in Hungary and Belgium. At a glance that could reflect negatively on his qualifying performance but his three lowliest grid positions that led to victories were all at races where he had either grid penalties for engine component changes Italy and Belgium or a power unit issue in qualifying Hungary. On top of that Ferrari has had a quicker car in qualifying at a number of races this year which was not the case among Vettels and Schumachers rivals when they were dominating. It means Verstappen has had to fight harder for the front row starting positions he has earned and to underline that point a surprising statistic from this year is that Leclerc has a higher average starting position 2.65 than Verstappens 2.70 while also securing nine poles to Verstappens seven. Again the comparison between eras is far from perfect but there is no doubt Verstappen has already put himself among the sports greatest drivers with many fruitful years of his career still to run. His team boss Christian Horner who is in a position to directly compare the newlycrowned twotime champion with fourtime champion Vettel gave a valid perspective on the two on Sunday night. They are two very different drivers two phenomenally successful drivers and I think what Sebastian has achieved in his career puts him among the greats and the most successful drivers in the sport he said on Sunday evening in Mexico. But I think Max what we are seeing today and this year we are actually witnessing something very special. I sometimes think that his achievements perhaps dont receive the plaudits that they should because what we have witnessed this year is an absolutely outstanding performance from a driver who is at the top of his game. Asked if Verstappens was the most impressive seasonlong performance from a driver Horner has seen he added Theres been years of domination with Mercedes but I think as an individual driver probably yes. He has won the most grands prix in a year now within 21 races. On top of that he has won two sprint races and he has not won all of them from pole position. Hes had to fight and race for a lot of those victories. When we look back at the end of the year it is an absolutely outstanding year that Max has driven. He hasnt put a wheel wrong. He has been perfect throughout the season and its incredible the level of consistency he has been able to achieve. Of course thats the opinion of a very proud team boss with a naturally biased viewpoint but even if Verstappen retired tomorrow it would be hard to deny his position among the top drivers in F1 history after this years performance. There will be some that point to Red Bulls breach of last years cost cap as a reason to diminish Verstappens achievement in 2022. But even the most exaggerated claims of how much performance Red Bull gained in the development of this years car by overspending last year would fall short of cancelling out his advantage over the rest of the field. Like him or not Verstappens performance this year has been truly exceptional.
Gasly wants talks with stewards after nearing F1 race ban in Mexico GP, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/gasly-wants-talks-with-stewards-after-nearing-f1-race-ban-in-mexico-gp/10393268/, Gasly has become increasingly frustrated with officialdom in recent weeks having been penalised for speeding under the red flag at the Japanese GP and for leaving too big a gap behind the safety car in Austin. He raised the matter of the harshness of the penalty points system in Fridays drivers briefing prior to the Mexican GP. Last weekend half the grid was giving too much space behind the safety car and I was penalised. At the end of the day I try my best inside the car and the last thing I want is to get stupid penalty points and lose race time. It was not just the penalty points because obviously Im quite close to being banned for a race he said when asked by Motorsport.com about the briefing debate., Listen to this article The point took his running 12month total up to 10 just two short of the figure that automatically triggers a suspension for one event. His first points were logged in the Spanish GP on May 22  which means under the current rules he wont lose any from his total until after next years Emilia Romagna GP the seventh round of the 2023 championship. Gasly has become increasingly frustrated with officialdom in recent weeks having been penalised for speeding under the red flag at the Japanese GP and for leaving too big a gap behind the safety car in Austin. He raised the matter of the harshness of the penalty points system in Fridays drivers briefing prior to the Mexican GP. He subsequently picked up a further point in Sundays race after being deemed to have left the track and gained an advantage when battling with Lance Stroll. He received a fivesecond penalty as well as the penalty point. Gasly was clearly frustrated after the Mexican race having fallen foul of the FIA yet again and after learning about the penalty point he even took a moment to gather his thoughts before speaking to the media. He was particularly frustrated that he wasnt told to give the position back to Stroll. Im a racing driver and if I see a gap I will go for the gap he said when asked about the Stroll incident by Motorsport.com. And if you are not happy about it tell me to give the position back and then I will try again. I wasnt given any comments so that is a shame. He added They just need to say it on the radio and that is what they have done in the past but for some reason not this time. Pierre Gasly AlphaTauri AT03 Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images Asked if he had to change his approach Gasly said he will speak to officials at the next race in Brazil. They the stewards seem to be quite harsh lately he said. Last weekend half the grid was giving too much space behind the safety car and I was penalised. This weekend I think it was quite tight and I dont know why I wasnt really given a message to give the position back. At the end of the day I try my best inside the car and the last thing I want is to get stupid penalty points and lose race time. Apparently at the moment they are not happy with what Im doing so I will have a discussion to understand exactly what I have got to change. Earlier in the weekend Gasly indicated that the discussion he initiated in Fridays drivers briefing about penalties had been a positive one even suggesting that the points system may be adjusted by the FIA  possibly in time to save him from a race ban in 2023. It was not just the penalty points because obviously Im quite close to being banned for a race he said when asked by Motorsport.com about the briefing debate. But in my opinion I dont feel like Ive been that dangerous over the last 12 months and it would be a shame to get a race ban for slowing down a bit too much behind the safety car and a couple of track limits this year. So I think theyre working on it and probably for next year there are going to be changes. Thats good to hear. Gaslys 2022 penalty points Spain Causing a collision Lance Stroll  2 points Austria Causing a collision Sebastian Vettel  2 points Austria Leaving the track without justification multiple times  1 point Japan Speeding under red flag conditions  2 points USA Car fell more than 10 lengths behind the safety car  2 points Mexico Leaving the track and gaining an advantage Lance Stroll  1 point On 10 October Gasly lost two penalty points earned for causing a collision with Fernando Alonso at the 2021 Turkish GP.

Red Bull boycott Sky Sports after reporter said Lewis Hamilton was 'robbed' of F1 title, https://inews.co.uk/sport/formula-one/red-bull-boycotts-sky-sports-ted-kravitz-lewis-hamilton-robbed-f1-title-1943825, Max Verstappen accused Sky Sports of being disrespectful and living in the past after Red Bull boycotted the broadcaster at the Mexican Grand Prix. Verstappen and his entire Red Bull team  including Christian Horner  refused to address Sky on Sunday. Their unprecedented stance came a week after Sky Sports pitlane reporter Ted Kravitz said Lewis Hamilton was last year robbed of an eighth world championship. It is understood Red Bull have grown increasingly frustrated with Skys coverage since the contentious Abu Dhabi finale. Initially Red Bull said the boycott would be indefinite but Horner indicated on Sunday night that their silence would end at the following round in Brazil on 13 November., Max Verstappen accused Sky Sports of being disrespectful and living in the past after Red Bull boycotted the broadcaster at the Mexican Grand Prix. Verstappen and his entire Red Bull team  including Christian Horner  refused to address Sky on Sunday. Their unprecedented stance came a week after Sky Sports pitlane reporter Ted Kravitz said Lewis Hamilton was last year robbed of an eighth world championship. It is understood Red Bull have grown increasingly frustrated with Skys coverage since the contentious Abu Dhabi finale. Sky Sports declined to comment. Confronting the subject after he won for a recordbreaking 14th time in one season on Sunday Verstappen said It had nothing to do with this weekend but this year. It has been a constant kind of digging and being disrespectful especially from one particular person. At one point it is enough and I dont accept it. You cannot live in the past and you have to move on. Social media is a very toxic place and if you are constantly being like that live on TV then you are making it worse instead of trying to make it better. You keep disrespecting me and at one point I will not tolerate it any more and that is why I decided to stop answering. Hamilton finished runnerup to Verstappen at last weekends United States Grand Prix in Austin after he was passed by the Red Bull driver with six laps remaining. Following the race Kravitz said Hamilton doesnt win a race all year and then finally comes back at a track where he could win the first race battling the same guy who won the race he was robbed in the previous year and manages to finish ahead of him. What a script and a story that would have been. But thats not the way the script turned out today was it Because the guy that beat him after being robbed actually overtook him because hes got a quicker car because of engineering and Formula One and design and pretty much because of Adrian Newey Red Bull technical chief over there. Verstappen claimed his maiden world championship after race director Michael Masi incorrectly applied the safety car rules in the closing laps of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Although Masi was removed from his position an FIA investigation said the Australian acted in good faith but made a human error. Initially Red Bull said the boycott would be indefinite but Horner indicated on Sunday night that their silence would end at the following round in Brazil on 13 November. There were some derogatory comments made so we took a break from Sky for this race he said. Max was upset. We were upset and we made the decision to stand together as a team. It wont have done Sky any harm for us to lay down a marker. Some of the commentary is fair but some pieces are sensationalist and saying we robbed anyone of the championship as was said in Austin is going too far. It is not impartial or fair or balanced. We have said our piece and will go back to normal next time. Earlier this month F1 bosses signed off a new deal with Sky which will mean the broadcaster retains exclusive UK television rights until the end of the 2029 season. Press Association

Alonso set for maiden Aston Martin F1 test in Abu Dhabi, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/alonso-set-for-maiden-aston-martin-f1-test-in-abu-dhabi/10393212/, The test to be held on the Tuesday following the final race of the season will feature two cars per team. Meanwhile Felipe Drugovich is due to drive last years Aston Martin AMR21 on the full Silverstone circuit on Tuesday the same car having recently been used by Zak OSullivan for his Aston Martin Autosport BRDC Young Driver of the Year Award run. Drugovich will however still be able to do the young driver test that follows the race weekend. Aston Martin Ambassador Jess Hawkins is also scheduled to do some laps in the AMR21 on Tuesday after Drugovich has run. In other rookie driver news Liam Lawson is expected to replace Max Verstappen at Red Bull in FP1 in Abu Dhabi the Kiwi having already done two sessions for AlphaTauri., The test to be held on the Tuesday following the final race of the season will feature two cars per team. Race drivers will run the definitive 2023 Pirelli tyres in one car and rookies will drive the other. Traditionally the Abu Dhabi running sees drivers who are moving teams for the following year gain their first experience with their new outfits assuming that they have been able to negotiate a release from their previous teams. Often part of the arrangement is that they appear in neutral or unbranded overalls. AlphaTauri boss Franz Tost revealed in Mexico on Friday that Nyck de Vries will drive for his team while Pierre Gasly is expected to make is first appearance for Alpine as part of the bigger deal that released him from the Red Bull camp for 2023. However Oscar Piastri has not yet been released by Alpine to drive for McLaren. The Enstone teams boss Otmar Szafnauer noted in Mexico I think our legal teams are discussing that now. And I dont know. Therell be more next week so ask me in Brazil. Its understood that Alonso had to gain permission himself for his release from Alpine with no direct involvement from Aston Martin and that he has been able to do so. Asked by Autosport if he had the cards in his hand that helped him to gain that release Alonso smiled and said Im always in charge of my own destiny Sebastian Vettel Aston Martin AMR22 Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images Alonso is expected to run half a day of tyre testing in Abu Dhabi with his new teammate Lance Stroll doing the other half. The Spaniard will be able to log further mileage with the AMR22 in Pirelli tyre testing in February prior to the launch of the new car and the sole official test session in Bahrain a week prior to the first race of the season. Meanwhile Felipe Drugovich is due to drive last years Aston Martin AMR21 on the full Silverstone circuit on Tuesday the same car having recently been used by Zak OSullivan for his Aston Martin Autosport BRDC Young Driver of the Year Award run. As well as being the first big step in Drugovichs development programme with the team it will be an important day for the Brazilian as he will have to complete 300km in order to qualify to take part in FP1 at the Abu Dhabi GP. If he fails to do so for any reason the team will have to find someone else to do the FP1 session with De Vries the obvious candidate. Drugovich will however still be able to do the young driver test that follows the race weekend. Aston Martin Ambassador Jess Hawkins is also scheduled to do some laps in the AMR21 on Tuesday after Drugovich has run. In other rookie driver news Liam Lawson is expected to replace Max Verstappen at Red Bull in FP1 in Abu Dhabi the Kiwi having already done two sessions for AlphaTauri.

But while the Dutchman and Red Bull are enjoying unprecedented success Verstappen says the environment on social media has become toxic. In part he blames UK broadcaster Sky Sports pitlane reporter Ted Kravitz for a series of comments made live on television.

Max Verstappen broke all time records on Sunday whilst admitting that he is boycotting the Formula 1 broadcaster Sky. We are definitely enjoying it and well try to go for more said the backtoback world champion after breaking Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettels alltime record for the number of wins now 14 in a single season. In Mexico he also raced past Lewis Hamiltons record now 416 for the number of points scored in a season. But while the Dutchman and Red Bull are enjoying unprecedented success Verstappen says the environment on social media has become toxic. In part he blames UK broadcaster Sky Sports pitlane reporter Ted Kravitz for a series of comments made live on television. Kravitz said Verstappen 25 doesnt seem to be a driver capable of winning a championship in a normal way and says Hamilton  who he has called an eight time champion  was robbed of the 2021 title. He Verstappen has got a quicker car because of engineering and Formula 1 and design and pretty much because of him Adrian Newey over there Kravitz also said. As the course of the Mexican GP weekend progressed it became clear not only that Verstappen was refusing to talk to Sky UK Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland but that Red Bull as a whole team was following suit. Verstappen confirmed the boycott. This year its been a constant kind of like digging being disrespectful especially one particular person he said. And at one point its enough you know I dont accept it. At the moment social media is a very toxic place. And if you are constantly being like that live on TV you make it only worse instead of trying to make it better in the world. You keep disrespecting me and one point Im not tolerating it anymore. Thats why I decided to stop answering Verstappen added. His boss Christian Horner backed his driver and confirmed that Red Bull had also boycotted the Sky broadcasters over the Mexican GP weekend. Were disappointed with a series of derogatory comments that have been made on Sky so we felt this weekend we would take a break he said. There needs to be balance in commentary. Some of the commentary is excellent but some of the pieces there is too much sensationalism being done. Max was very upset about it and as a team we support him fully.
FIA post-race press conference - Mexico City, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.fia-post-race-press-conference-mexico-city-2022.7jLyhzROnX4I8Tmn6n1odT.html, I was so close I think in that first stint but I think the Red Bull was just clearly too fast today and ultimately maybe they had the better tyre strategy. I really really pushed hard. MV Yeah I mean another great race I think. So yeah another great race but also its just an incredible season for us as a team. So ultimately I think they were on the right tyre strategy., DRIVERS 1  Max VERSTAPPEN Red Bull Racing 2  Lewis HAMILTON Mercedes 3  Sergio PREZ Red Bull Racing PARC FERM INTERVIEWS Conducted by Marc Gen Q Hello everybody. Hola todos. Max Verstappen you are unstoppable. Tell me first on the race which was the key point because everybody spoke about the start. And you did great. You know do you think that was a very important key to win that race Max VERSTAPPEN Yeah of course that helped me out a lot for the rest of the race to stay in the lead after Turn 1. Of course we were also on a different strategy to the cars around us. But yeah again an incredible result. The pace of the car was again really nice. We had to look after our tyres because it was a very long stint on the medium but we made it work. Q Youve been to many many podiums but have you ever seen something like that with such a big crowd MV Its amazing. Its an incredible atmosphere and we love to come here. Q And finally Max. I dont know how much you look into numbers or how much you are into history. World Champion and now you are the first driver ever to win 14 grands prix in one season. How do you feel about that MV Yeah its been an incredible year so far. So yeah we are definitely enjoying it and well try to go for more. Q Well done. Enjoy. Lewis Hamilton second place. You were pushing all the way. You were pushing Max at the beginning of the race. Did you think at some point that you could win the race Lewis HAMILTON Yeah well first this has been an amazing crowd and definitely a bit awkward this time rounds boos all day but nonetheless I have so much love for Mexico and for the people here and what a great race and event they have put on this weekend. I was so close I think in that first stint but I think the Red Bull was just clearly too fast today and ultimately maybe they had the better tyre strategy. Q About the tyres and the strategy you tried the Hard compound we could hear you on the radio that it was difficult. What was the problem Do you think the Hard was not the right tyre at that moment of the race LH Yeah not sure it was the right tyre the end. I thought we should have started on the Soft but obviously we had the opposite tyre. It was OK in the first stint but that Hard was just offset so congratulations to Max and its great to be up here and separate the two. Q Still well done you kept the pressure on Checo so well done for that second place. And now Checo. Well done. What do you feel What are your emotions What are your emotions to be in front of 70000 Mexicans here in the Foro Sol Sergio PREZ Yeah I mean I gave my best you know today at the start. I really really pushed hard. Unfortunately we had a little bit of a bad stop which prevented us to undercut Lewis. Overtaking is so difficult. As soon as I got behind him it was really difficult to follow so I had to stay in third. Q But still I think a key point was the start when you overtook Russell to be on the podium. Do you think that was very important in Turn 4 SP Yeah definitely. You know given how difficult overtaking was today I think that it was key you know. I thought we were going to be a little closer but unfortunately it didnt work out for us today but still its good a good podium in front of this crowd. I really wanted more today but third place its still a good. PRESS CONFERENCE Q Well done Max that was a brilliantly controlled race and one that sees you take the record of 14 wins in a season. Another incredible milestone in an extraordinary season. MV Yeah I mean another great race I think. We knew that the first stint was going to be the crucial one for us to keep that Soft tyre alive long enough which seemed to work. I mean I did struggle a bit towards the end but luckily the gap was big enough to extend a few laps. And yeah once we put on the Medium tyres everything was working quite well. And I think quite early on we figured that we could make it to the end. So yeah another great race but also its just an incredible season for us as a team. Never thought I would be able to win 14 races in a year. But yeah of course Im incredibly proud. Q Can I throw another stat at you With 416 points youve also broken the record for the number of points scored in a single season. How high can you go MV I mean we have a sprint race in Brazil and laughs Hopefully we can score a few more but I mean its not about that. At the end of the day its all about trying to win a championship and it doesnt matter with how many points you do it but it does show that we are having an incredible year. Q Can we talk a little bit more about strategy Did you consider the Hard tyre at that pit stop MV No. I tried it in FP1 and it just didnt really feel great. So I think thats why we never really wanted to use it. Q You seemed to be managing a fair bit during the race not just looking after the tyres. We heard you talking about bouncing. We also heard you comment on the gearshifts. Just how many issues were there MV No no real issues. Its just that the kerbs here are quite aggressive and I was trying a few different lines and some worked and some didnt. And with the gears I think it was just after the pit stop I think the clutch was a bit warm. And after that it was OK. Q A final word on the podium. We can hear the music in the background now just how special is it here in the Foro Sol MV Yeah I mean they put on a great show. I mean the atmosphere in general is incredible. The fans are super passionate about Formula 1 but of course about Checo. But it also helps a lot You know you have that whole stadium and it makes it look incredible. Its a great atmosphere. Q Max many thanks and many congratulations as well. Lewis were coming to you now. Great job. Your second second place in as many weeks although you didnt seem totally happy with your strategy after the race. What would you change if you ran the race again LH Well firstly Im really happy to be up here and to be able to split the Red Bulls I think is a huge result for us. Brought an upgrade into the last race and to have kindof close the gap a little bit  they still have the edge I think  but I dont know I think it was amazing for us to be fighting in qualifying and have the second and third. I was speaking about in strategy about us taking a risk with one of the cars at least doing something different. I had a gut feeling that they will be on the Soft to start with and when everyone took their blankets off everyone around us was on the Softs and were on the Mediums. At that moment. I thought that we may be in trouble. But then again its a long long race so I thought maybe theyll be on a twostop. But that Medium tyre just had no dropoff. So ultimately I think they were on the right tyre strategy. But I am grateful I was able to just about keep up within that first stint. Thats huge to be able to keep up with a Red Bull. Q You said during the race that you werent happy with the Hard tyre. Did you consider going longer on the Medium and then going straight to Soft LH I mean I kept telling them the tyre was fine but Im assuming that they were coming into my window. Sergio had already stopped. So Im assuming they they were going much quicker than me perhaps. So if we stayed out longer I would have come out behind Sergio and it would have been all over. So I think thats the reason. Unfortunately at the beginning obviously had a good battle through Turns 1 and 2 but obviously my teammate got jumped by Sergio so I was basically tagteamed by the Red Bulls. Its very very hard in strategy when you dont have both cars there. I think Sergio was able to come in and pull me in which definitely hindered our strategy. Q Were talking a lot about strategy  but what positives do you take from this weekend I mean was this the most competitive the car has been this year LH Yeah its so so many positives to take from this weekend. And yeah this is definitely the most competitive and the best the car has felt all year  and that is truly down to the amazing work from all the women and men back at the factory who have just been doing such an amazing job. And not giving up. I think its just been a real showing of resilience and perseverance. And Im so happy to be kindof back in that fight. We saw in the last race kindof almost having a chance to win. And I dont know what the car will be like in these next races. Im hoping in Brazil something special may come of it. But well see. Q Checo coming to you now. Another third place for you at home. How sweet was the podium this time SP It was always very sweet. Unfortunately I think today we could have been a bit higher you know we had a better stop. But at the end I think second or third doesnt really matter. As long as Im on the podium. It was great to have all these people. They have been amazing the whole weekend. And it was just nice to finish off the weekend with a podium. Q Lets go through the race in chronological order. Can you describe the opening few corners How crucial was it for you to pass George Russell at that point SP Yeah it was quite important to make some progress on lap one. So I managed to get George early on and then just stay with Max and Lewis throughout that first stint. And we boxed relatively early for the Medium which was going to be an undercut on Lewis but unfortunately we had a bad stop. And we just came behind the Ferraris a bit too far and that meant that we were just we lost too much time going through them. So yeah that was I think what really prevented us getting Lewis because I could see he was struggling in the early laps with the Hard tyre and that was our opportunity. Once you get them going he seemed to pull away a bit. And yeah unfortunately there was not much I could do because every time I was getting close to him things were overheating brakes engine tyres so I have very few chances to attack him. I use a few times ERS but no more than that. Q And youve retaken second place in the Drivers Championship five points ahead of Charles Leclerc. Do you feel youve got the momentum in that battle now SP It can change racetorace. For now I just want to go into the next two and aim for the win. Theres nothing more to lose so we will try everything. Its been a very difficult weekend with far too many issues so we need to put everything together and then I believe we can do the next step.

'Constant digging' - Verstappen explains Sky F1 boycott, https://the-race.com/formula-1/constant-digging-verstappen-explains-sky-f1-boycott/, Max Verstappen and Red Bull boycotted interviews with Formula 1 broadcaster Sky Sports over the Mexican Grand Prix weekend as the world champion believes Sky has been disrespectful throughout his second titlewinning season in 2022. Sky exclusively broadcasts every F1 race live in key markets including the UK Germany and Italy and recently signed an extension to broadcast F1 in the UK until the end of 2029. But freshlycrowned twotime champion Verstappen said he wont tolerate what he regards as the disrespect that Sky has shown him during 2022. Its not just been Sky UK its been across all of the Sky channels  Germany Italy. Verstappen hits out at keyboard warriorsBeyond his Sky stance Verstappen also took aim at the wider problem of toxic social media discussion around F1., Max Verstappen and Red Bull boycotted interviews with Formula 1 broadcaster Sky Sports over the Mexican Grand Prix weekend as the world champion believes Sky has been disrespectful throughout his second titlewinning season in 2022. Sky exclusively broadcasts every F1 race live in key markets including the UK Germany and Italy and recently signed an extension to broadcast F1 in the UK until the end of 2029. But freshlycrowned twotime champion Verstappen said he wont tolerate what he regards as the disrespect that Sky has shown him during 2022. It had nothing to do with this weekend but this year has been a constant kind of like digging and being disrespectful especially from one particular person Verstappen said when asked about the boycott after winning the Mexican GP. At one point its enough I dont accept it. You cant live in the past you just have to move on. Social media is a very toxic place and if you are constantly being like that on live TV you make it only worse instead of trying to make it better in the world. You keep disrespecting me at one point Im not tolerating that anymore so thats why I decided to stop answering. It is understood that the one particular person Verstappen mentioned is reporter Ted Kravitz who has been a longterm fixture of F1 broadcasting for well over two decades. Verstappen didnt confirm which individual he was referring to but Horner said comments that were raised in Austin were key to the decision and added accusations of championships being robbed is something that we dont feel is an impartial commentary obviously we dont feel thats in any way fair or balanced. Horner said Verstappen was was very upset about it and as a team we support him fully and we were equally upset about it leading to the decision to not participate in any Sky interviews for the Mexico weekend only. Were obviously just disappointed with a series of derogatory comments that have been made on Sky so we felt that this weekend wed just take a break and that it wouldnt do Sky any harm he said. There needs to be balance in commentary. Some of the commentary is excellent but some of the pieces theres too much sensationalising and we stand together as a team. Its not just been Sky UK its been across all of the Sky channels  Germany Italy. It was just for this weekend it was just to register our discontent in sometimes some of the less impartial comments or accusations that are sometimes made as TV seems to be becoming ever more sensationalised. There has been no direct interaction with Sky from any team member this weekend. Sky channels have still been able to use Red Bull driver interviews recorded by F1s inhouse broadcast team. Horner added that he felt Red Bull had become a cheap target and broadcasters needed to take a more careful approach. The world that we live in is always hungry for headlines and I think sometimes there needs to be a responsibility from the broadcasters not to feed those he said. Verstappen hits out at keyboard warriors Beyond his Sky stance Verstappen also took aim at the wider problem of toxic social media discussion around F1. I think its just that the sport is more popular so there are more people watching so more people are writing just that Verstappen said when asked why it was becoming more toxic. Its not great that they are allowed to write these kind of things so I hope we can come up with an algorithm that stops people from being keyboard warriors because these kind of people will never come up to you and say these things in front of your face. Theyre just sitting in front of their desk at home being upset and frustrated and they can write whatever they like because the platform allows it. That can be really damaging and hurtful to some people not how it should be. Hamilton echoed Verstappens comments and called for social media companies to take action  something he wasnt hopeful would happen. Social media is getting more and more toxic as the years go we should probably all get off it Hamilton said after the race. Mental health is such a prominent thing right now so many people reading the comments and stuff people say and it is hurtful. Fortunately I dont read that stuff but the media platforms definitely need to do more to protect people particularly young kids and women but at the moment theyre not doing that so I think it will just continue.

The 25yearolds 14th victory of the season sees him pass Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel for the most race wins in a single season in Formula One history. Earlier in October Verstappen claimed his second career world championship at the Japanese Grand Prix and last week he won the US Grand Prix in Austin Texas which saw him share the record for number of season race wins. With his victory in Mexico Verstappen also broke the record for the most points accumulated in a single season previously set by Lewis Hamilton in 2019. The records confirm Verstappens dominance this season. After an inauspicious start in Bahrain back in March he has won race after race comfortably seeing off an early challenge from Ferraris Charles Leclerc. Speaking after Sundays race at Autodromo Hermanos Rodrguez in Mexico City Mexico Verstappen looked forward to more success. An incredible result. Its been an incredible year so far. Were definitely enjoying it and well try to go for more the Dutch driver said. Seventime world champion Lewis Hamilton finished in second place some 15 seconds behind the Dutchman and Red Bulls Sergio Perez came in third. Max Verstappen celebrates his 14th victory of the season. Chris GraythenGetty Images Verstappen started on pole and glided away while Hamilton behind him overtook teammate George Russell. The two teams began on different tires  Mercedes on the mediums in the hope of challenging the Dutchmans dominance with Red Bull on the softs  and for a while the cars were evenly matched. Red Bull pitted their drivers first opting for medium tires while Hamilton fitted hard tires so that he would not have to pit again. Ultimately Mercedes strategy did not pay off as Hamilton could only watch Verstappen increase his lead and team boss Toto Wolff later acknowledged over the radio that it was maybe not the right tire choice according to the BBC. But for all of Verstappen and Red Bulls achievements this year there was a shadow cast over the team on Sunday after it was sanctioned for a budget cap breach last year. Red Bull Racing RBR and the FIA agreed an Accepted Breach Agreement ABA for the teams breaking of F1s cost cap rules in 2021 the sports governing body announced on Friday. RBR were found to have breached the cost cap by 432652 501409. Max Verstappen has now won eight of the last nine F1 races. Chris GraythenGetty Images The punishment amounts to a fine of 7 million a 10 reduction in cost limits for RBRs aerodynamic testing for next year and responsibility for the costs incurred by the Cost Cap Administration who were responsible for investigating the breach. In the FIA statement the Cost Cap Administration noted that RBR acted cooperatively throughout the review process and that there is no accusation or evidence that RBR has sought at any time to act in bad faith. The more draconian part is the sporting penalty which is a 10 reduction on our ability to utilise our wind tunnel and aerodynamic tools team boss Christian Horner said in a press conference according to ESPN. That represents anywhere between 0.25 seconds and 0.5 seconds of lap time. That comes in from now it has a direct effect on next years car and it will be in place for a 12month period. Two races remain on the F1 calendar for Verstappen to add to his record tally with the Brazilian Grand Prix scheduled on November 13 and the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on November 20.

ET  8 p.m. GMT 2 p.m. local timeSundays 2022 Mexican Grand Prix is set to start at 2 p.m. local time. Below is the complete TV schedule for the weekends F1 events at the United States Grand Prix. The Russian Grand Prix originally scheduled for Sept. 25 was cancelled because of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine., Max Verstappen described his latest victory as amazing after setting a new record for the most wins in a Formula One season by cruising to victory ahead of Lewis Hamilton at the Mexican Grand Prix. In his recordextending fourth win in Mexico City Verstappen stretched his lead over Hamilton during the second half of the race to win by more than 15 seconds. What an unbelievable season said Verstappen speaking to Sky Sports after a 14th triumph of the campaign that moved him ahead of the record set by Michael Schumacher in 2004 and matched by Sebastian Vettel in 2013. Simply unstoppableMax33Verstappen makes it an extraordinary FOURTEEN wins in 2022 breaking the record for the most wins in a season2TheMax MexicoGP pic.twitter.comTE7mOJ9o4b  Formula 1 F1 October 30 2022 Its an incredible atmosphere. We love to come here. Its been an incredible year so far. We are definitely enjoying it and we will try to go for more. Red Bulls Sergio Perez could not become the first Mexican to win the race but was enthusiastically roared on as he finished third ahead of Mercedes George Russell. Tyre troubles thwart Mercedes Hamilton reflected that Mercedes should have joined Red Bull in starting on soft rather than medium tyres after the seventime champion repeatedly struggled having started on mediums and switched to hard tyres after 25 laps. Russell wanted to be switched to soft tyres and Mercedes boss Toto Wolff whose team had told Hamilton during the race that their rivals on mediums would falter accepted that they had made the wrong choice. That should not reduce the credit afforded to Verstappen for achieving the rare feat of starting on pole in Mexico City and maintaining the lead beyond the first corner. Hamilton had been on blistering early form and the race felt in the balance before his tyre change which heralded Verstappen gradually pulling away. Russell briefly led and Hamilton was left to rue what might have been during a race lacking drama as Verstappen celebrated at the end. I would have been really intrigued to see what would have happened if we had started with the medium and gone on to the soft said Russell adding that he had felt like he was driving on ice. Mega job everyone Thanks for continuing to push. They were just too quick for us today. But lets keep pushing. Were getting closer. pic.twitter.com7JRblD6ouD  MercedesAMG PETRONAS F1 Team MercedesAMGF1 October 30 2022 Seventime champion Hamilton failed to secure his first win of the season and said Ultimately maybe they had the better tyre strategy. Im not sure it was the right tyre in the end  we should have started on the soft. Congratulations to Max. Perez pride on homecoming Perez had started in fourth with a fervent fanbase hoping the driver known as Checo would challenge in his seventh home Grand Prix. In search of a fifth race win of his career the man who comes from a motorsport family was passionately supported by relatives including his father Antonio Perez Garibay. Perez senior watched intently with headphones on during the race and showed as much pride as he did energy when he waved the Mexican flag while his son took to the podium. The atmosphere would have been sensational had Perez won but his performance in separating the Mercedes pairing was met with vigour by the crowd. Mercedes had gambled that Perezs medium tyres would cause him to fade and allow Russell through in the closing laps but he finished more than 31 seconds clear. Overtaking was so difficult so I had to stay in third Perez said afterwards. I thought we were going to be a little closer but it didnt work out. Its a good podium. In front of this crowd I wanted more  but third place is still a good day.

Lap 67 Quite the debate going on between Russell and Mercedes. Why should we stay out he asks. The tyres are gone. Hes informed that Perezs tyres will be more gone than yours. Lap 65 Alonsos race is run because of a mechanical problem. He hops out of the car and walks off raising his hand to the receptive crowd after initially throwing a fist of frustration into the air. A blinkandyoullmissit VSC is observed. Lap 63 Hamilton is now 12 seconds behind leader Verstappen with Perez in third  how those fans will love it if he can finish there  and Russell in fourth. Lap 62 Alonsos got a problem and Ricciardo reaches seventh. Hes been on scintillating form since pocketing that penalty. Lap 60 Its a familiar story but neither Russell nor Hamilton are happy with their tyres the seventime champion sounding a little like hes resigned to Red Bull seeing this one out. Theres been little to choose between Hamilton and Verstappen in terms of recent lap speeds. Lap 59 Verstappen is cruising here. Ricciardo is blasting through the ranks passing Bottas to take P9 and showcase the advantages of soft tyres. Lap 57 Heres your leaderboard... Lap 56 Tsunoda is the only retirement of the race so far and McLaren allow Ricciardo beyond Lando Norris in an attempt to build up a head of steam before serving his penalty. Lap 54 Ricciardo is hit with a 10second penalty over this incident. LAP 5171 Contact between Ricciardo and Tsunoda  The AlphaTauri car has damage.

Alpha Tauris Yuki Tsunodas race is over His car trundles off after taking a nudge from Daniel Ricciardo. That could spell trouble for the culprit. Lap 49 Sergio Perez will have to do 20 laps longer than you did on the medium to get to the end of the race Russells team tell him. Hes around seven seconds shy of Perez whos still in third place. Lap 48 Bottas tries to get revenge on Ocon  theres precious little between them but the French driver holds on to P10. Meanwhile Verstappen moves 10 seconds ahead of Hamilton Lap 46 ...and that completes the set as Ricciardo comes in to receive softs. Its looking highly promising for Red Bull right now but you wouldnt count against Hamilton mounting the kind of surge hes struggled to put together since falling behind. Lap 45 Zhou Guanyu takes a pit stop leaving Daniel Ricciardo as the only driver not to have come in... Lap 43 Mercedes caution Hamilton that medium tyres may not be the answer after he joins Russell in fretting over the hards. Verstappen is well over nine seconds ahead of Hamilton in first. Lap 42 Alpines Estaban Ocon rattles past Bottas to put himself in contention for points by taking P10. Bottas just couldnt keep him off there almost touching tyres. Lap 41 Verstappen has now gained more than half a second on Hamilton in each of the last three laps. Lap 40 Sebastian Vettel finally changes from soft tyres having spent 40 laps on them.

Lap 35 Verstappen retakes the lead Hes seeking a record 14th win in a season today and takes advantage as Russell comes in to receive hard tyres. Lap 34 Russell wants to change to softs but is discouraged from doing so by Mercedes. Alonso is much happier with his tyres than most suggesting that hes comfortable whatever the selection. Lap 32 Lando Norris makes the same switch as Hamilton opting for hard compounds as he heads in for a pit stop. Fans in Mexico shirts in the stands are vigorously roaring Perez on as ever. Lap 31 Hamiltons pit means that Russell takes top spot but hes yet to pit. Verstappen and Perez after either side of thirdplaced Hamilton. Lap 30 Now its Hamiltons turn to pit after he voices concerns about his mediums. Mercedes switch him to hard compounds. Lap 28 Verstappen isnt at all happy with his gear shifts.

Lap 22 A pit stop looks imminent for Verstappen whos just informed his team that his soft tyres are struggling. The tactical battle we expected is developing nicely. Lap 21 If Bottas chat earlier suggested he had two plans of attack coming into this race Leclerc evidently has more tricks up his sleeve he asks his team for Plan C over the radio. Thats a new one. Lap 19 Ferrari frustration Leclerc is warned off going for broke after telling his team that they have nothing to lose.

Lap 10 Heres how it looks so far as Verstappen maintains a lead of around 1.5 seconds on Hamilton who is whipping round this circuit in pursuit of a potential first win of the season. Lap 9 Theres been quite a battle between Zhou Guanyu and Daniel Ricciardo for P12 with the McLaren driver twice trying to overtake him. This time he secured DRS and overtakes his Alfa Romeo rival. Poor Kevin Magnussen who was having trouble before the race is last at the moment. Mick Schumachers two places ahead of him. A forgettable one for Haas. Lap 7 The gap between Russell and the top two is widening. Its still Verstappen Hamilton Perez and Russell making up the top four with Carlos Sainz in fifth. Lap 6 Perez is pesky for Mercedes in the battle with Red Bull preventing them from ganging up on Verstappen. Lap 5 Interesting to overhear the instructions being given to Alfa Romeos Valtteri Bottas in eighth. Theyre telling the Finn that hes in a strong position and advising him to stick to whatever their original prerace plan was. Lap 3 Hamilton takes about 0.3 seconds off Verstappens lead with the fastest lap of the race so far reducing it to 1.2 seconds. Perez remains third. Fernando Alonso who didnt sound terribly optimistic before the race has moved up two places to seventh.

Verstappen whose Red Bull team opted for a softmedium tyre strategy took the chequered flag some 15 seconds clear of Hamilton who was left to question why Mercedes swapped their starting set of mediums for hards. But after experiencing technical problems throughout the qualifying hour Checo had to make do with fourth on the grid lining up behind polesitting Red Bull team mate Verstappen and the Mercedes cars of Russell and Hamilton. Alonso had been firmly in that fight behind the Red Bull Mercedes and Ferrari cars but a failure failure with just six laps to go ended his afternoon and added a fresh twist in the battle for P4 in the constructors standings. Verstappen has now achieved the most race wins in a single F1 season, Max Verstappen claimed his 14th victory of the 2022 season in the Mexico City Grand Prix ahead of Mercedes rival Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull team mate Sergio Perez after an intriguing strategic battle played out at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez. It secures another record for the Dutchman in his burgeoning career as he now boasts the most wins in a single F1 campaign moving one clear of the 13 achieved by Michael Schumacher 2004 and Sebastian Vettel 2013. Verstappen whose Red Bull team opted for a softmedium tyre strategy took the chequered flag some 15 seconds clear of Hamilton who was left to question why Mercedes swapped their starting set of mediums for hards. Perez gave the home fans something to cheer about in third having threatened to challenge Hamilton late on while Russell  who lost out to his team mate at the start  took a distant fourth. FORMULA 1 GRAN PREMIO DE LA CIUDAD DE MXICO 2022 Mexico 2022 Race results POSITION TIME POINTS 1 Max Verstappen VER Red Bull Racing 13836.729 25 2 Lewis Hamilton HAM Mercedes 15.186s 18 3 Sergio Perez PER Red Bull Racing 18.097s 15 4 George Russell RUS Mercedes 49.431s 13 5 Carlos Sainz SAI Ferrari 58.123s 10 Russell was also unhappy with his strategy repeatedly asking Mercedes to pit again and ditch the hard tyres which failed to bring the race back to the Silver Arrows in the closing stages  a stop for softs with two laps to run at least yielding the fastest lap. Ferrari endured a lacklustre race as Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc claimed lonely P5 and P6 finishes ahead of McLaren driver Daniel Ricciardo who charged his way to seventh with soft tyres late on and kept the position despite a 10second time penalty for a clash with Yuki Tsunoda. Esteban Ocon placed eighth after a painful late retirement for Alpine team mate Fernando Alonso as the other McLaren of Lando Norris and Alfa Romeos Valtteri Bottas  not quite able to repeat his qualifying performance  completed the points. Strategy played a key role throughout Sundays race in Mexico City AlphaTauri driver Pierre Gasly picked up a fivesecond penalty for an early aggressive move on Aston Martin rival Lance Stroll and ultimately missed out on a point by just half a second with Alex Albon 12th for Williams. Zhou Guanyu got his Alfa Romeo to the line ahead of Aston Martin pair Vettel  sporting a touching tribute helmet to the late Dietrich Mateschitz  and Stroll followed by the Haas cars of Mick Schumacher and Kevin Magnussen. Nicholas Latifi was the final finisher in his Williams with the aforementioned Alonso grinding to a halt with an engine issue late on and Tsunoda retiring after briefly going airborne in his collision with Ricciardo. Race Highlights 2022 Mexico City Grand Prix AS IT HAPPENED A sellout crowd delivered a party atmosphere in the build up to Sundays race with the every move of home hero Perez being enthusiastically cheered as had been the case throughout practice and qualifying earlier in the weekend. But after experiencing technical problems throughout the qualifying hour Checo had to make do with fourth on the grid lining up behind polesitting Red Bull team mate Verstappen and the Mercedes cars of Russell and Hamilton. Intriguingly Verstappen and Perez opted for soft tyres to attack the run of more than 800 metres to Turn 1 with Russell and Hamilton going for mediums  meaning there would be an array of strategic permutations to keep an eye on as the encounter developed. At the back Haas driver Magnussen started 19th with a fiveplace grid penalty for an engine change with Aston Martins Stroll in P20  having been docked three places for his clash with Alpine rival Alonso in Austin. When the lights went out and the 71lap race roared into life Verstappen made a clean getaway to defend from the Mercedes drivers off the line and down to Turn 1 before Hamilton pounced on Russell in the middle of the first chicane to take P2. As Verstappen held the lead at the start Hamilton got the jump on Russell for P2 Perez then got a run on Russell exiting the tight Turn 123 complex and having jumped out of the slipstream swept around the outside of his rival at Turn 4 sparking another deafening roar in the grandstands lining the circuit as he moved into the podium places. Sainz held fifth in his Ferrari with the Alfa Romeo of qualifying star Bottas dropping back to eighth behind the other F175 of Leclerc and between the Alpines of Alonso and Ocon  McLaren driver Norris rounding out the top 10. In the early laps Hamilton went with leader Verstappen and initially sat little more than a second adrift of his 2021 title rival before dropping back by a few tenths  engine cooling a crucial factor for consideration amid the high altitude and warm temperatures. You just need to try and break this tow. Youre doing a great job was the message to Verstappen shortly afterwards with almost two seconds separating himself and Hamilton by Lap 10 when attention started to turn to the pit stops. Verstappen edged away from Hamilton before the focus turned to the pit lane Some drama in the midfield involved Gasly forcing his way past Stroll under braking for Turn 4 on Lap 14 but the stewards quickly determined that the AlphaTauri man had forced the Aston Martin off the track and handed him a fivesecond time penalty. While Verstappen continued to edge away from Hamilton up front Perez sat around six seconds off the lead and Russell 7.5s as Sainz and Leclerc settled into a quiet race of their own  the Ferraris struggling to live with the pace of the Red Bull and Mercedes machines. As the race moved past the 20lap mark Verstappen reported some tyre concerns  at one point stating the left front doesnt want to turn  with Red Bull stretching out their opening stint on softs and the Mercedes duo biding their time on the more durable mediums. Perez was the first of the frontrunners to pit on Lap 24 swapping his softs for mediums in a tardy fivesecond stop due to a sticking rearleft tyre with Verstappen pitting two laps later releasing Hamilton and Russell into the lead. While Perez fell behind yettostop Ferrari pair Sainz and Leclerc forcing him to pull off some extra overtaking and spark further cheers from the home fans Verstappen slotted into P3 some 20 seconds off new leader Hamilton who reported that my tyres are okay. Hamilton did all he could to keep the pressure on Verstappen and Red Bull Nonetheless on Lap 30 Hamilton and Mercedes decided it was time to pit switching from mediums to hards while Russell asked to extend his stint and aim to bolt on a set of softs in the closing stages of the race. Russell temporarily led Verstappen by some 10 seconds with Hamilton six seconds further back but lighting up the timing screens on the harder tyres  giving his team mate some extra information to consider ahead of his own stop. Russells soft tyre ambitions were shortlived as he boxed on Lap 35 to follow Hamilton onto the hard tyres rejoining the action in fourth around 16 seconds off the lead before being told to lift and coast for the remainder of the race. His initially competitive pace on the hards fading Hamilton reported that they did not feel as comfortable as the mediums and Russell soon joined him on the radio to question the strategic move  but Mercedes sought to reassure both drivers that the race would come back to them. Further back Sainz and Leclerc continued their race as the best of the rest as Ocon joined Alonso in getting past Bottas with a fine move to put the Alpines in P7 and P8 respectively  Norris keeping his hands on the final point with 20 laps to run. There was plenty of midfield scrapping between Bottas and the Alpines On Lap 51 Norriss team mate Ricciardo tipped the AlphaTauri of Tsunoda into the air at Turn 6 amid a fierce wheeltowheel scrap prompting the stewards to hand the Australian a 10second time penalty  Tsunoda pitting to retire his damaged car. But the punishment appeared to fire Ricciardo up as he used his relatively fresh soft tyres to pass Norris Bottas Alonso and Ocon moving up to P7 and doing all he could to build enough of a margin and still emerge with some points. With the race entering its final 15 laps Verstappen found himself leading Hamilton by more than 10 seconds while Perez closed in on the Mercedes in a bid to bag another Red Bull onetwo finish  both Hamilton and Russell continuing to question the mediumhard strategy. Despite further reassurances from the Mercedes pit wall that the race would come their way in the form of the Red Bulls hitting late tyre trouble Verstappen had no such problems and eked out a 15second winning margin. Perez was unable to reel in Hamilton for P2 but at least made the podium in his home race while Russell pitted with two laps to run to bolt on a set of softs and score an extra point with the fastest lap. Verstappen celebrates victory number 14 of the season in front of the Mexican fans Sainz and Leclerc finished around a minute behind Verstappen while Ricciardo did just enough to build the required 10second margin over Ocon for P7 as Norris and Bottas rounded out the pointspaying positions. Alonso had been firmly in that fight behind the Red Bull Mercedes and Ferrari cars but a failure failure with just six laps to go ended his afternoon and added a fresh twist in the battle for P4 in the constructors standings. Gasly and Albon narrowly missed out on points for AlphaTauri and Williams with Zhou having to settle for P13 in the second Alfa Romeo followed by the Aston Martins of Vettel and Stroll. Haas also left emptyhanded as Schumacher led Magnussen home in P16 and P17 respectively with Latifi the last driver to take the chequered flag after Alonso and Tsunodas retirements. Verstappen has now achieved the most race wins in a single F1 season

Hamilton: Red Bull "too fast" for Mercedes to beat in F1 Mexican GP, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/hamilton-red-bull-too-fast-for-mercedes-to-beat-in-f1-mexican-gp/10393051/, I was so close I think in that first stint Hamilton said of his initial stint on the medium tyres but I think the Red Bull was just clearly too fast today. Im not sure the hard was the right tyre in the end. It was OK in the first stint but the hard tyre was just offset. Hamilton had to be content with second 15s off Verstappen by the end as the Red Bull pace showed little sign of dying down. Verstappen then made a gain of time in the pitstop phase and got his lead to over 10s as Hamilton struggled to stabilise the gap on the hard tyres., Listen to this article Both Hamilton and George Russell began the race on medium tyres with Mercedes trying to counter Red Bulls start on the soft rubber as Max Verstappen wanted to cover off the threat of a run into the first corner. Although it seemed that Mercedes was going to attempt to go long into the race on the mediums and switch to softs at the end the team instead made the jump to hards with Hamilton before halfdistance with Russell following suit. The pair could occasionally match the Red Bulls on pace but the gambit of waiting for the medium tyres on Verstappen and Sergio Perezs cars to fade away did not work as tyre wear proved low throughout the race. I was so close I think in that first stint Hamilton said of his initial stint on the medium tyres but I think the Red Bull was just clearly too fast today. Ultimately maybe they had the better tyre strategy. Im not sure the hard was the right tyre in the end. I thought we should have started on the soft obviously we had the opposite tyre. It was OK in the first stint but the hard tyre was just offset. Congratulations to Max its great to be up here and separate the two. Hamilton had to be content with second 15s off Verstappen by the end as the Red Bull pace showed little sign of dying down. The Briton had been around two seconds behind Verstappen on the opening stint as the race settled down but was unable to arrest the steady progression of the gap out in front. Verstappen then made a gain of time in the pitstop phase and got his lead to over 10s as Hamilton struggled to stabilise the gap on the hard tyres. This grew amid the virtual safety car period for Fernando Alonso as the Alpine drivers engine died in the late stages of the race. Perez had got close to Hamilton in the second phase of the race even getting to within DRS range but the Mexican was unable to find a way past at his home race. I gave my best today and really pushed hard Perez said after the race. But overtaking is so difficult. As soon as I got behind him it was really difficult to follow. I had to take third.

The two penalty points take Gasly to 10 in a 12month period. That is just two from a race ban and he will not lose any of his existing penalty points until next May. Read moreThe strict nature of the F1 penalty points system has been criticised by several drivers at various times in recent years. The stewards are supposedly limited with what they can do as there is effectively a set list of sanctions and associated licence penalty points to choose from., Pierre Gasly is on the brink of a race ban in Formula 1 after picking up another penalty in the Mexican Grand Prix. Gasly was given a fivesecond time penalty and one licence point for gaining advantage by going off track  and forcing Lance Stroll to do likewise  while making a pass in the opening stint of the race . The AlphaTauri driver locked up and ran deep into Turn 4 going beyond the white line himself with Stroll on the outside. The two penalty points take Gasly to 10 in a 12month period. That is just two from a race ban and he will not lose any of his existing penalty points until next May. It means Gasly must complete the final two races of 2022 and the first seven races of next year without any incidents that earn him two penalty points.

It would be a shame to get a race ban for slowing down a bit too much behind the safety car and a couple of track limits infringements this year he said. Alpine move is Gaslys shot at redemption  but will he use it Read more The strict nature of the F1 penalty points system has been criticised by several drivers at various times in recent years. Currently any penalty issued also comes with licence points by default. The stewards are supposedly limited with what they can do as there is effectively a set list of sanctions and associated licence penalty points to choose from. Gasly suggested that the FIA is working on it and claimed probably for next year theres going to be changes. At the moment youre losing points for these safetycar infringements or track limits and obviously the penalty for it is a race ban which we all agree and also the stewards agree is quite harsh said Gasly. I think theyre working on it and theres something that should be different for next year.

Home hero Sergio Perez finished third ahead of George Russell with the Ferrari drivers a minute behind by the finish in fifth and sixth. At the start Verstappen launched well in front of Russell and swung right in front of the Mercedes on the very long run down to the first corner  with Russell gaining from the Red Bulls slipstream to run ahead of Hamilton and Perez.

Lewis Hamilton Mercedes W13 Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images There Russell came along Hamilton but ran out of room and had to climb over the kerbs therefore losing momentum and being jumped the quickly arriving Perez into Turn 4 at the end of the second straight. Verstappen immediately moved out of DRS threat at the end of lap one of 71 with Hamilton giving chase having started on the medium tyres as did Russell compared to the used softs fitted to the two Red Bulls. Over the next phase of the race the gap between the leaders fluctuated slightly but generally held around 1.5s as Perez and Russell ran a few seconds further adrift and falling further behind over the course of the first stint. Approaching the end of the races first quarter Verstappen upped his pace in a bid to break the tow to the Mercedes but Hamilton was able to hang on just over two seconds behind before the leaders softs began to give up. From a maximum of 2.4s Verstappens advantage was down to 1.6s by the time he came in at the end of lap 25  one tour after Perez had pitted and suffered a slow leftrear change that left him stationary for 5.0s. Running the more durable tyre Mercedes left Hamilton out  his mediums showing none of the dark wear patches that had been evident on Verstappnens leftfront soft before he stopped. But Hamilton only remained out for another four laps before he was brought in to switch to the hard tyres with Mercedes instead leaving Russell out to complete a much longer first stint. He therefore led until the end of lap 34 Verstappen cycling back into the lead at halfdistance with a near seven second lead and Hamilton under more pressure from Perez running closely behind  the Mexican driver having cleared the offthepace Ferrari pair after his slow stop. Max Verstappen Red Bull Racing RB18 Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images Hamilton suggested the hards were not performing as well as the mediums he had given up with Mercedes in turn implying performance drop off logged at the end of his first stint might give him a chance to catch Verstappen late on. That looked a mighty ask 15 laps into Hamiltons second as he faced a near 10s gap to the dominant leader but at least able to keep Perez at arms length just a few seconds behind. Indeed the status quo continued to hold with Hamilton questioning whether his hard tyre set was the right compound to be on and Mercedes insisting it was due to its added durability on a onestopper. But with Verstappen continuing to edge away by a few tenths each lap as the leaders made their way through traffic with 15 laps left he had a lead of 12.1s. As it turned out Mercedes hoped for dramatic pace drop off for Red Bull never happened and Verstappen romped home to win by 15.1s having completed a mammoth 46lap final stint on the mediums. A late race stoppage for Fernando Alonso who had been running comfortably in seventh before an engine issue caused him to lose pace and eventually stop in the Turn 1 runoff did not cause much of a disruption other than a short virtual safety car activation on laps 6566. Perez ended up 2.9s behind Hamilton having fallen further behind shortly before the VSC with Russell fourth and also vocally frustrated about having to run the hards in his second stint. That ended up only being his middle stint as Mercedes pitted Russell to take the softs for a final lap shot at the fastest lap bonus point which the Briton duly secured with a 1m20.153s. Carlos Sainz Ferrari F175 Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images Carlos Sainz led Charles Leclerc home in an anonymous race for Ferrari  the Spaniard ending up 58.8s adrift of Verstappen and the only action for the pair involving Perezs poststop passing and Sainz doing likewise to Alonso after his own service to go from softs to mediums. Leclerc the last car on the lead lap and 10s behind his teammate the drama to the finish concerned McLarens Daniel Ricciardo. He had produced the second longest opening stint on the mediums in staying out until lap 45 after which he was rapid on the softs but made a bad error hitting Yuki Tsunoda at Turn 6 a few laps after his pitstop. With the AlphaTauri retiring in the pits Ricciardo was handed a 10stime addition penalty which he overcame with a sterling drive up the field after being waved by teammate Lando Norris who was completing the mediumhard strategy. Ricciardo produced pass after pass  including being part of a double move on Alonso into Turn 1 shortly before the Spaniard retired with his teammate Esteban Ocon going by ahead of Ricciardo into Turn 1 before in turn being caught and passed by the Australian. In clear air from there Ricciardo charged and eventually finished 12.1s ahead of Ocon to negate his penalty. Norris and Valtteri Bottas who had dropped back on lap one after his fine qualifying and then battled the Alpines in the first and middle phases of the race before falling back completing the top 10. Tsunoda was the races only other retirement.

Dan IstiteneFormula 1Getty Images What is F1 and how is it different from IndyCar Both IndyCar and F1 are openwheeled singleseater racing formats. This means that the cars can only fit one person and have uncovered wheels that protrude from the body of the vehicle. Despite their basic similarities F1 and IndyCar offer very different experiences. In F1 there are only 10 teams with two drivers apiece for a total of 20 drivers. Most races must go for 305 km which is about 190 miles. Each driver needs to use two different tires in the race so a pit stop is mandatory though cars are not allowed to refuel. Races average around two hours in length and are held at venues all over the world. Teams spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year developing their cars. All cars must have certain elements  for example gearboxes must have eight gears plus a reverse and last for six consecutive races  but teams have leeway to tweak and change some parts of their car including their engines in the pursuit of speed. In contrast the cars featured in IndyCar are more standardized. They all have the same aerodynamic kit and chassis and can only be powered by one of two engines  either a Honda or a Chevrolet. That said teams are allowed to develop some of their own parts like dampers and some of their suspensions. IndyCar races occur on a wide range of tracks from fast ovals to road and street courses. The length of the races also varies with some like the Indianapolis 500 lasting 500 laps and taking over three hours to complete. Not surprisingly refueling during pit stops is a big part of the strategy during IndyCar races. Teams can field more than two cars meaning that the amount of drivers on the grid fluctuates from race to race. IndyCar is mostly considered an American sport and does not have the same level of money and glamour associated with it compared to the globehopping F1 circuit. Why should I care about F1 F1 races might best be described as a sort of actionpacked chess match that takes place while drivers are throttling around a track at close to 200 mph. Teams need both strategy and skill to compete against some of the best minds in motorsports. F1 is also full of strong personalities. The Netflix documentary series F1 Drive to Survive follows many of the teams and drivers over the course of a year and has helped raise the profile of the sport in the US. Released in March season four of the series chronicles last years tight championship race between rivals Verstappen and Hamilton. It also focuses on the internal battles between drivers on the same team while giving viewers a peek into the tense pressurized world of elite racing. Does F1 stream on ESPN Plus ESPN does not air any F1 coverage on its ESPN Plus streaming service. If you want to watch the practices or races you will need a television provider of some kind or to pay for F1s 80 per season TV Pro subscription.

Why F1 drivers are calling for respect as fans fill Mexican GP paddock, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/why-f1-drivers-are-calling-for-respect-as-fans-fill-mexican-gp-paddock/10392743/, In keeping with a recent trend the F1 Experiences organisation has sold hundreds of packages that give paddock access to wellheeled fans. I think thats just thats cool thats fun thats life. I think thats certainly like the sensitive moments when youre about to go into the car he said. It was a lot more open for fans fans were a lot closer to the action fans had access to the drivers and to the teams which I enjoyed a lot. There are a lot of reasonable people involved on the team side and on F1 side said Seidl., In keeping with a recent trend the F1 Experiences organisation has sold hundreds of packages that give paddock access to wellheeled fans. However drivers have found the atmosphere oppressive with fans physically pushing and pulling them whenever they try to make it from their hospitality buildings to their garages seemingly with no respect for personal space. While paddocks have become busier as Liberty Media has opened up access and tried to monetise it Mexico has reached an unprecedented level of hysteria with scary scenes as drivers are mobbed when they venture out into the open. On Saturday after completing their postqualifying TV pen interviews they had to be ushered through the FIA hospitality building to a quieter back route to the rest of the paddock while some teams have employed extra security guards outside their hospitality buildings. The topic of fan access was discussed in Friday evenings drivers briefing. Most admit to mixed feelings about whats been happening in Mexico. There are loads of people in the paddock said Ferraris Charles Leclerc. Its good because it shows how much more interest there is in F1. Its always been crazy here but especially this year. But on the other hand maybe we need to find something to allow us to walk a bit easier in the paddock. I love having the fans around me said Carlos Sainz. I love having everyone around us cheering us especially I guess because Im Latin we have a kind of a special relationship. I only ask everyone to stay calm that we are in a paddock that they dont push or dont shout too much. Fans waiting for autographs Photo by Mark Sutton  Motorsport Images Pierre Gasly admitted that he was finding life difficult in Mexico. I think letting people in is fine said the Frenchman. But its true that now we feel like some guests sometimes are not really respecting the space that we need. People are coming in garages before qualifying and asking for pictures when they are not even from our team. Were working here and obviously we give time for the fans when we can. But this weekend I didnt dare come out of the hospitality because otherwise you get mobbed. And sometimes it gets quite hectic. I arrived at the hospitality yesterday morning with my bag with my passport open and I didnt even feel it. We talked about it in the drivers briefing. I think its great and also to see kids and people really enjoying it but just maybe find a way where they can understand where to reach us and when to give us a bit more space. On Saturday evening McLaren drivers Lando Norris and Daniel Ricciardo talked at length about the issue. These are two of F1s nice guys who have developed strong relationships with their fans and yet both were clearly rattled by whats unfolded this weekend. Consider too that they have it easy relative to the likes of Lewis Hamilton Max Verstappen and Mexican local hero Sergio Perez. I love having the fans in here especially when its kids and stuff said Norris. And in a way you cant control what they do like kids are kids thats cool. Theyre looking up to us as being in our place one day and dreaming of what were doing and and were the idols and heroes and so on. I think thats just thats cool thats fun thats life. Valtteri Bottas Alfa Romeo F1 Team throws a hat to fans Photo by Zak Mauger  Motorsport Images But I guess more for the older people and so on theres not as much respect for just personal space and things like that as what there should be. They should feel lucky enough to be in the paddock and get to be as close as they are to us. Because its easy for us to always go around the back ways and have people literally shove them out of the way and so on so we dont sign anything. But we want to do that and we are happy to do those things. And we want to walk down the paddock. But there just needs to be a little bit more just respect from people for our personal space and boundaries and things. Norris pointed out that there are few sports where people can rub shoulders with the stars just before they head to perform. I would say theres not as many other sports where fans can get maybe quite as close now to the athletes or whatever he said. So again like I said they should feel lucky enough to be here and to be as close as they are to where we are doing our work. But in a lot of the other sports they just seem more respectful. More the adults and the people who should realise what were doing and the time we have to spend and the work and whatever and have the level of respect that they should have for us. They need to show that more often. And simple as that. Ricciardo echoed his teammates opinion noting that things have been building up over the course of the season as F1 has allowed more people in. This year has got more hectic said the Australian. I think theres two sides to it. I think the paddock used to lack atmosphere. I remember eight years ago 10 years ago the paddock was actually a pretty dull place. Daniel Ricciardo McLaren Photo by Mark Sutton  Motorsport Images So I do like having atmosphere in the paddock. I think it should be a fun place to be. But there should also be boundaries. I think to be in the paddock and have a VIP pass its a privilege. I think you also should act with some maturity and have respect. That hasnt always been shown this year. People lose their mind. Ricciardo made the simple point that those buying paddock access should be given a set of rules to follow. I feel like they should at least have some guidelines like these are the kind of the rules inside the paddock. As I said I do want the atmosphere. And I dont want security to be honest I dont want to be walking in a huddle and just walking through people. I want to be able to have photos and sign. I think if everyones just says please thank you and shows a little bit of respect then well keep obviously giving them that in return. I honestly I do catch myself calling people out way too often for not saying please or thank you. They just run up dont say a word do what they have to and then go. For that you feel like a little bit honestly like used. I think if they set some guidelines maybe that helps because there arent any at the moment. So if its just a bit of awareness then maybe theyll be a little more cool. I dont want to see it change. I just think adults need to act like adults. Ricciardo made the point that attention from overeager fans can be particularly distracting just before drivers head out on track. I think thats certainly like the sensitive moments when youre about to go into the car he said. And I think as well people forget this isnt an ordinary sport. Fernando Alonso Alpine A522 Daniel Ricciardo McLaren MCL36 Photo by Mark Sutton  Motorsport Images Were jumping in cars were going the speeds we go we require a certain amount of commitment concentration and all that sort of stuff. And thats just the truth. So especially the fact that its that as well its not an ordinary sport there needs to be some distance before the time we go into the car and compete. So it could even be that theres like a little bit of an offlimits interval of 15 minutes before the session starts or 20 minutes that theres some form of guidelines  this is a moment where the drivers are kept to themselves or whatever. Again I dont want to come up with solutions on the spot. But we do need to get in a certain headspace to get behind the wheel of these cars. So I think having some distance around maybe those crucial moments could be helpful. Norris agreed with Ricciardo that guidelines or rules would help. I dont know what can be done about it its hard to know exactly what needs to be done he said. But a simple thing where they sign to get the tickets you must show respect and have the appropriate behaviour when youre in the paddock to the drivers especially in the lead up to any session were going to do. And if thats not followed and people are aggressive and grab you like they do a lot of the time then biff them out. McLaren boss Andreas Seidl came to F1 from championships with relaxed paddock access and he sees the positive side. I think its very important to not overreact now he said. When I left F1 after my first stint in 2010 and I could experience other paddocks like DTM like the Nordschleife WEC and Le Mans especially. Fans of Lewis Hamilton Mercedes AMG Photo by Steve Etherington  Motorsport Images To be honest I was enjoying it. It was a lot more open for fans fans were a lot closer to the action fans had access to the drivers and to the teams which I enjoyed a lot. And whenever during this period of my sportscar time I went back to the to the F1 paddock as a guest it felt a bit odd because it was so sterile and quiet no guests in there even on a SaturdaySunday where you were not sure if thats the right way in terms of creating exclusivity or whatever. I think the direction F1 took is definitely the right one and a good one and we appreciate a lot the atmosphere that is around now in the paddocks throughout the season. However Seidl admitted that things have gone too far in Mexico and that a compromise needs to be reached for future races. Here its clearly too extreme said the German. And I think we just need to follow up and have a good discuss in now with F1 how we can make sure that especially in countries like here in Mexico where the fans are also so passionate for what we are doing and so enthusiastic that we just always keep the right level of respect. We will find solutions there. And then can keep enjoying this new atmosphere that we have in the paddocks throughout the world. Its worth noting that in just two weeks well be in Brazil another Latin country full of passionate fans  and with a much more cramped paddock than that in Mexico. Can action be taken by then There are a lot of reasonable people involved on the team side and on F1 side said Seidl. Im sure that the right measures will put in place short term and mediumlong term.

Alonso: We need to stop putting F1 fans against each other on social media, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/alonso-we-need-to-stop-putting-f1-fans-against-each-other-on-social-media/10392682/, In an interview with Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf that was published on Saturday twotime F1 world champion Alonso discussed former teammate Hamilton and current world champion Max Verstappen when reflecting on last years podium in Qatar. Alonso said he thought Verstappen had performed better than Hamilton last year and was a worthy champion in 2021 adding I also have a lot of respect for Lewis. Still it is different when you win seven world titles when you only had to fight with your teammate. Lets enjoy them.The quotes and tweet led to fierce discussion among fans on social media but Alonso said he wanted to try to help and make social media a better place by clearing up his comments. We need to stop putting the fans against each other., In an interview with Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf that was published on Saturday twotime F1 world champion Alonso discussed former teammate Hamilton and current world champion Max Verstappen when reflecting on last years podium in Qatar. Alonso said he thought Verstappen had performed better than Hamilton last year and was a worthy champion in 2021 adding I also have a lot of respect for Lewis. Still it is different when you win seven world titles when you only had to fight with your teammate. Then I think a championship has less value than when you have fewer titles but have had to fight against other drivers with equal or even better material. But after the quotes were picked up and started to circulate on more outlets stating that Alpine driver Alonso considered Verstappens championships to be more valuable than Hamiltons titles the Spaniard took to Twitter to clarify his comments. He wrote And again Please all the titles are amazing well deserved and inspiring. Incomparable to each other and lets enjoy champions and legends of our current time. Tired of the continuous search for headlines. Lets enjoy them. The quotes and tweet led to fierce discussion among fans on social media but Alonso said he wanted to try to help and make social media a better place by clearing up his comments. We need to all collaborate on that said Alonso. We need to stop putting the fans against each other. We are all in the same thing. Great champions great sportsmen and we try to enjoy this beautiful time. Alonso noted in the original interview that he did not fight against Renault teammate Giancarlo Fisichella for his titles in 2005 and 2006 nor did Verstappen battle against Sergio Perez or former teammate Alex Albon to win races. Fernando Alonso and Giancarlo Fisichella Renault celebrate in Parc Ferme Photo by Mark Sutton  Motorsport Images But Michael Schumacher in particular fought with his teammate Rubens Barrichello to become champion five times in a row and Hamilton with Nico Rosberg and Valtteri Bottas Alonso added. Thats different I think. But seemingly in response to Alonsos comments Hamilton posted a picture of them together on the podium from the 2007 United States Grand Prix when they were teammates at McLaren. The race saw Alonso fume at McLaren as he lost to Hamilton  then in his rookie season  amid an acrimonious season that ended with Alonso leaving after just a single year. Hamilton posted the picture of him standing on the top step of the podium with his hand on Alonsos shoulder simply with a thumbs up emoji. Additional reporting by Erwin Jaeggi
Schumacher calls for F1 bollard change after track limits frustration, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/schumacher-calls-for-bollard-change-after-track-limits-frustration/10392729/, Had it stood until the end of the session it would still have been good enough for seventh. However the time was quickly deleted by the stewards for cutting track limits on the apex of Turn 2. At the end of the session Schumacher was left stranded in 16th. If we have a bollard it would be great if the bollard was positioned in such a manner that youre not able to go over track limits. We changed rear wing changed floor changed front wing because weve had some suspicions about what we were running., Listen to this article The Haas driver logged a lap of 1m19.965s towards the end of Q1 which at the time put him in sixth place. Had it stood until the end of the session it would still have been good enough for seventh. However the time was quickly deleted by the stewards for cutting track limits on the apex of Turn 2. At the end of the session Schumacher was left stranded in 16th. Schumacher admitted that he had been aggressive in taking a lot of kerb but said hed used the bollard on the apex as a reference  and suggested that it should have been placed in such a way that drivers couldnt be deemed to cut the corner if they aimed to brush past it. Well I knew it was aggressive he said when asked by Motorsport.com about the incident. But in my eyes it was going to be enough. If the bollard is there its there for a reason. I took reference off that. Unfortunately I think thats a point that well probably have to address because with these cars obviously these days its hard to see. If we have a bollard it would be great if the bollard was positioned in such a manner that youre not able to go over track limits. That would definitely help a lot all of us for sure. So yeah quite unfortunate. The difference of cutting it that much or not its probably less than a tenth. When Schumacher made a final attempt on used tyres he was also compromised when other drivers passed him before he could start the lap. He said that violated the gentlemans agreement about not passing other cars on preparation laps. It was always going to be tough he said. But I think more than that it was also the gentlemans agreement that wasnt kept by like three or four cars. Which was silly really. But its the way it is. It definitely hurt the preparation of the lap which meant I couldnt warm up the brakes just as much as I wanted it to and going to Turn 1 with the question mark. Kevin Magnussen Haas VF22 Photo by Mark Sutton  Motorsport Images Meanwhile Schumachers teammate Kevin Magnussen earned 15th in Q2 and then dropped back to 19th thanks to a grid penalty for a taking a new V6 engine. The team made significant changes to his car for qualifying. We treated qualifying a little bit like a test said the Dane when asked by Motorsport.com about the session. We changed rear wing changed floor changed front wing because weve had some suspicions about what we were running. So the car did change around a lot. And we had to really go a completely different direction on the front flap to get the balance to be similar. So theres some stuff to look at tonight for sure. Asked if the car was better in its revised form he conceded that it was hard to tell. It might be but we were just so far off that we never really got back into the right spot he explained. You only get so many chances in qualifying. He also admitted that the team may now decide to make further changes that would oblige him to sacrifice 19th on the grid and start from the pitlane For sure were thinking about that.
Max Verstappen Takes Mexico Grand Prix Pole Position, https://sports.ndtv.com/formula-1/max-verstappen-takes-mexico-grand-prix-pole-position-3473408, Twotime world champion Max Verstappen gave Red Bull reason to smile again on Saturday when he secured pole position for Sundays Mexico City Grand Prix with an authoritative late qualifying lap. Verstappen took control on his first run in Q3 and then trimmed his time to resist the threat from the muchimproved Mercedes team. The passion of the fans here is really incredible and in the stadium it is just amazing to drive there. The opening Q1 period saw Hamilton maintain Mercedes muchimproved form in the rarefied atmosphere at 2200 metres altitude by topping the times ahead of Verstappen and Leclerc. On his second run Verstappen regained third but was relegated a place by Sainz seizing second and splitting the silver arrows for Ferrari., Twotime world champion Max Verstappen gave Red Bull reason to smile again on Saturday when he secured pole position for Sundays Mexico City Grand Prix with an authoritative late qualifying lap. After 24 hours of arguments and derision following the announcement of Red Bulls penalty for breaching Formula Ones 145 million cost cap last year it was a sweet return to success with his sixth pole this year and the 17th of his career. The 25yearold Dutchman clocked a best lap of 1min 17.775sec to finish 0.304 seconds ahead of George Russell and his Mercedes teammate seventime champion Lewis Hamilton. Verstappen took control on his first run in Q3 and then trimmed his time to resist the threat from the muchimproved Mercedes team. He will be hunting a record 14th win in a single season on Sunday. That was a good qualifying the Dutchman said. It was a close one but we made a few adjustments to the car and got into a better rhythm so to be on pole here is of course amazing. Its a very long run down to Turn One here so we need a good start but I think we have a quick car and thats what is most important. The passion of the fans here is really incredible and in the stadium it is just amazing to drive there. His Red Bull teammate and local hero Sergio Perez was fourth ahead of Ferraris Carlos Sainz and a resurgent Valtteri Bottas of Alfa Romeo. Verstappen said he was sure Perez will be there in the fight tomorrow. Charles Leclerc who crashed heavily on Friday was seventh in the second Ferrari ahead of McLarens Lando Norris and the Alpines of twotime champion Fernando Alonso and Esteban Ocon. Russell was disappointed. Sorry sorry sorry he said on his team radio after running wide on his final lap. The team deserved more today. Theyve produced a really great car this weekend and it felt like our pole to have and I did a terrible lap at the end. Hamilton who had harboured hopes of doing better was philosophical. This is the best qualifying weve had all year. It just shows that perseverance and never giving up can pay off. Im quite happy with that position  its a along way to Turn One. The session came after many leading teams reacted negatively to Red Bulls 7 milliion fine and 10 percent reduction in permitted aerodynamic research for overspending last year. Ferrari said they were deeply unhappy and Mercedes said Christian Horners description of his teams punishment as draconian was an exaggeration while McLaren said it was not harsh enough.  Home hero Perez  All that was set aside when qualifying started at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez where the air temperature was 25 degrees Celsius and the track 49 near perfect conditions. The opening Q1 period saw Hamilton maintain Mercedes muchimproved form in the rarefied atmosphere at 2200 metres altitude by topping the times ahead of Verstappen and Leclerc. Fourtime champion Sebastian Vettel was among those eliminated. After a turbulent start to the season when they were beset by porpoising problems Mercedes had made steady progress and the RussellHamilton onetwo was their best session result of the year. Hamilton in 118.552 took command ahead of Russell by 0.013 seconds the pair heading Bottas and Verstappen on their first runs before Perez emerged alone to a roar from the sellout crowd. Checo Checo they chanted as he took third on a set of new soft tyres. On his second run Verstappen regained third but was relegated a place by Sainz seizing second and splitting the silver arrows for Ferrari. At the flag it was Daniel Ricciardo of McLaren Zhou Guayyu of Alfa Romeo Alpha Tauris Yuki Tsunoda and Pierre Gasly and Kevin Magnussen who missed out on the topten shootout. Promoted The top five were separated by less than onetenth of a second the top four by just 0.014 seconds  a clear signal of a close tussle for pole position to come as Perez went early into Q3. His 118.153 was swiftly beaten by Verstappen in 117.947 with a sensational lap that was unmatched on the first runs as Hamiltons best lap in 118.094 was deleted for exceeding track limits on the kerb at Turn Three.
Andretti: Verstappen is 'a perfect example' of a Formula 1 champion, https://www.motorsportweek.com/2022/10/15/andretti-verstappen-is-a-perfect-example-of-a-formula-1-champion/, 1978 Formula 1 world champion Mario Andretti considers Max Verstappen to be the prime example of what a Formula 1 champion should be believing he will be at the front of the field for the foreseeable future. Verstappen recently won his second consecutive Drivers Championship at the Japanese Grand Prix joining a select few champions to successfully defend their title the following year. A perfect example of what a world champion should be. Vettel went on to win four championships in a row with Red Bull and Andretti wouldnt rule out Verstappen doing the same. If they can be compared to Max then you belong in Formula 1., 1978 Formula 1 world champion Mario Andretti considers Max Verstappen to be the prime example of what a Formula 1 champion should be believing he will be at the front of the field for the foreseeable future. Verstappen recently won his second consecutive Drivers Championship at the Japanese Grand Prix joining a select few champions to successfully defend their title the following year. The Dutchman has done so in dominating fashion winning twelve grand prix so far. With four races still left to contest it is still possible for him to beat Michael Schumachers and Sebastian Vettels jointlyheld record of 13 wins in a single season. There is nothing better than being able to repeat a Championship especially after what went on at the end of last year. Its deserving as you can see Andretti told Sky Sports F1. Dominating so far this season and he will probably dominate the rest of the way. A perfect example of what a world champion should be. Max is where he needs to be right now hes complete. His racecraft is superb a lot of credit to the team. A lot of credit to the team the strategies are always right on. When you have that going for you thats it. Hes a tough one to beat and it seems like he is there for the foreseeable future for sure. He became the second Red Bull driver to bring home a Drivers Championship following in the footsteps of Sebastian Vettel who asserted a period of dominance in the early 2010s. Vettel went on to win four championships in a row with Red Bull and Andretti wouldnt rule out Verstappen doing the same. If everything works then you are almost unbeatable. It will remain so for the foreseeable future he continued. I would have loved to run against him. You always want to be able to measure yourself against the best and some young drivers today will think that too. If they can be compared to Max then you belong in Formula 1. That gives a driver a huge boost. You always want to aim for the top and Max shows what he looks like.

Williams and Haas  whose driver Magnussen has a fiveplace grid penalty having taken his sixth engine  began their runs first the rest of the field waiting a minute or two to hit the track.

Verstappen meanwhile was 0.382s off the pace with his first run taking P4 ahead of Ocon. A huge tow on the front straight saw Leclerc begin his lap with an advantage but he lost time in Sector 2 and ended up 0.557s off the pace in P6. With three minutes left Perez  who was sitting 12th  once again emerged on a clear track and this time he found more than a second.

Perez began the shootout packedout Foro Sol grandstands emitting a goosebumpinducing roar for their home driver as he set a time of 1m 18.153s. Perez would drop down to third after Verstappen eclipsed him by twotenths Russell going a provisional second by 0.132s and Hamilton P3 by 0.147s  before track limits at Turn 3 cost him that flying lap. Worries compounded for Hamilton as he reported drivability issues soon after. Sainz then Bottas rounded out the top five. The Mexican driver went out first once again followed closely by his rivals but could not improve beyond P3. He had time for another run. Verstappen meanwhile improved to a 1m 17.775s and Russell had his final time chalked off to finish 0.304s off the champions pace. Hamilton couldnt sweep the sessions and for the 11thstraight year there would be a different polesitter at the Mexican Grand Prix Verstappens time would not be toppled. Later admitting his final effort was a terrible lap Russell ended up second on the grid however and Hamilton third  just 0.005s off his team mate. Bottas starred throughout qualifying Perez settled for fourth but was backed to recover by his team mate as the crowd cheered for the Mexican long after the chequered flag flew while Sainz rounded out the top five more than half a second off the pace. Bottas took P6 to split the Ferraris in a stunning performance for Alfa Romeo while Leclerc settled for seventh 0.780s off pole. That left Norris in eighth with Alpines Alonso ninth and Ocon rounding out the top 10. Verstappen now holds the advantage but not since 2016 has the polesitter won in Mexico City.
Mercedes and Ferrari suggest Red Bull's Formula 1 budget cap penalty for breaching rules is not enough, https://www.eurosport.co.uk/formula-1/mercedes-and-ferrari-suggest-red-bulls-formula-1-budget-cap-penalty-for-breaching-rules-is-not-enoug_sto9207038/story.shtml, Mercedes and Ferrari have suggested Red Bulls penalty for breaching the budget cap is not enough despite claims from Christian Horner that the punishment is draconianAdThe FIA revealed Red Bull overspent by 1.86m last year and interpreted 13 points of the budget cap regulations incorrectly including the cost of power units catering and staff wages.

Brazilian Grand Prix Hamilton Mercedes face huge mountain to climb to compete again for race wins 15 HOURS AGO Horner has claimed it will cost Red Bull between 0.25 and 0.5 seconds. The scale of that penalty isnt much more than what you would lose if you were just one place higher up in the championship Mercedes head of trackside engineering Andrew Shovlin told the press. I think describing it as draconian is an exaggeration. Reducing the number of runs does limit your freedom when youre developing your concept but were in reasonably wellexplored regulations now. But you definitely have to be more efficient about it. If it were half a second which Ive heard mentioned then the team at the back of the grid would have a threeseconds advantage to one at the front and that simply isnt the case. But it depends on how well you make decisions during the year. I would have thought a tenth or a bit more than a tenth maybe twotenths is realistically what that will cost you. McLaren team principal Andreas Seidl has also expressed his displeasure at the penalty stating that Red Bull should stop telling fairytales. Ferrari racing director Laurent Mekies feels the punishment is on the lenient side and was particularly unhappy that the 6.07m fine is separate to Red Bulls budget cap spend. We certainly think its low said Mekies. We dont see it on the same scale as to be able to compensate the overspending that was done. Especially combined with the fact that the penalty is not combined with any budget cap reductions for them. So we say altogether what will remain of the real impact of the penalty will probably be very small.

FIA will not deem F1 cars that lose mirrors unsafe after all, https://the-race.com/formula-1/fia-will-not-deem-f1-cars-that-lose-mirrors-unsafe-after-all/, The FIA will not deem Formula 1 cars unsafe if they lose a wing mirror or take action against teams in such circumstances despite the original penalty applied to Fernando Alonso last week. Alonso lost seventh place in the United States Grand Prix after Haas successfully protested his car for being raced in an unsafe condition. Alonso gets US GP seventh place back as penalty overturned Read moreThis was because the Alpine had been driven with its right wing mirror flapping after an airborne crash until the mirror broke off completely. Ahead of the Mexican Grand Prix though the FIA has held talks with the teams and appears to have been convinced that this should not be considered unsafe. They are optimistic that minor damage will be accepted while continuing to assess damaged cars and then apply the blackandorange flag if required., The FIA will not deem Formula 1 cars unsafe if they lose a wing mirror or take action against teams in such circumstances despite the original penalty applied to Fernando Alonso last week. Alonso lost seventh place in the United States Grand Prix after Haas successfully protested his car for being raced in an unsafe condition. Alonso gets US GP seventh place back as penalty overturned Read more This was because the Alpine had been driven with its right wing mirror flapping after an airborne crash until the mirror broke off completely. When the stewards made their judgement they cited FIA technical delegate Jo Bauer calling a flapping mirror unsafe and that the car was unsafe to be driven with a mirror missing while the FIAs head of singleseater matters Nikolas Tombazis was said to have agreed that the car was not safe in that condition. Alonsos penalty was eventually overturned as after an initially unsuccessful protest of its own Alpine successfully petitioned a review of the Haas protest and the stewards said it should not have been admitted as it missed a deadline to be filed. However this was effectively a technicality and the original stewards decision appeared to stand  indicating that in the future cars with broken mirrors would either need to retire or pit until they could be fully repaired. Ahead of the Mexican Grand Prix though the FIA has held talks with the teams and appears to have been convinced that this should not be considered unsafe. The original Haas protest against Alpine was triggered by frustration with inconsistent application of the blackandorange flag as Haas felt it had been unfairly forced to pit in three races this year for minor front wing endplate whereas Alonso  and Red Bulls Sergio Perez  were able to race on in the United States Grand Prix with damage. Teams have been told that the FIA will be more selective with the use of that flag and The Race understands that after discussions it has been agreed that damage like the front wing endplate or indeed the mirror does not meet the threshold to be a safety concern. The failings exposed yet again in FIAs F1 penalty Uturn Read more Alpine sporting director Alan Permane said there had been very positive discussions with the FIA technical department and that they agreed things have gone too far. From here onwards small damages like the mirror like the front wing endplate if its nonstructural like a brake duct  something like that will not be considered to be a black and orange flag offence said Permane. This is still ongoing and Im sure at the technical advisory committee and the sporting advisory committee well discuss it more but a line in the sand has been drawn. This means while Haas ultimately lost its protest it has succeeded in forcing a reckoning on what constitutes an unsafe car. Asked by The Race about the difference between the new position and what the stewards reported from the FIA officials in Austin Permane said I dont want to speak for Jo or Nikolas but what our discussion yesterday was and weve had some texts from them this morning specifically saying the loss of a mirror wouldnt be considered a black and orange flag. I think if we adopt these guidelines from Mexico onwards weve got a sensible place. Gary Anderson F1 should have more penalties like Alonsos Read more Other teams have indicated that the talks since Austin have provided clarity on the matter. They are optimistic that minor damage will be accepted while continuing to assess damaged cars and then apply the blackandorange flag if required. Ferraris sporting director Laurent Mekies said What matters is that we have an understanding of what is and isnt OK. We move on with that understanding and we can have a consistent application of the regulations and everybody knows what the limit is. Hopefully its a clearer situation which has been defined yesterday which is good news. The overarching element is for the FIA for whenever they see something unsafe still dont want to have parts flying off the car and hitting somebody else we are sure they will keep their finger on the button in that case to keep us at bay. Mercedes trackside engineering director Andrew Shovlin said We dont want black and orange flags every race because weve survived a lot of years where they were used correctly and infrequently and we do need to just let the drivers get on with driving and not be too afraid of getting near another car.

The five F1 drivers that shocked us during Mexico City GP qualifying, https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1015979/1/five-f1-drivers-shocked-us-during-mexico-city-gp-qualifying, Charles Leclerc  7thIt was a rare off day in qualifying for Charles Leclerc  the man with nine pole positions to his name in 2022. Speaking after qualifying in Mexico Leclerc hinted at a potential engine issue which hampered his performance in qualifying. Sebastian Vettel  17thAfter an impressive run of races for Aston Martin Sebastian Vettel was knocked out in Q1 in Mexico City. Max Verstappen  1stThe reigning world champion saved his best for last in qualifying in Mexico. Its timely considering Aston Martins remarkable run of results putting Alfa Romeo under immense pressure in the race for sixth., Charles Leclerc  7th It was a rare off day in qualifying for Charles Leclerc  the man with nine pole positions to his name in 2022. Leclerc ultimately qualified a disappointing seventh even losing out on a position to Alfa Romeos Valtteri Bottas in the dying stages of Q3. While their pace has often looked to be on par with Red Bull and Mercedes the driveability of the Ferrari has looked very tricky particularly in the middle part of the lap. Both Leclerc and Carlos Sainz have been seen on countless occasions correcting oversteer moments and struggling with the rear of their car. Speaking after qualifying in Mexico Leclerc hinted at a potential engine issue which hampered his performance in qualifying. It was a difficult session but there is a problem I am sure. We need to look into it. It was mostly enginewise we were losing a lot of time down the straights. And there were lots of problems with driveability the engine was not responding to the throttle. Especially at high speed it was extremely difficult. I really hope we can fix that for tomorrow if yes I feel confident we can have a good result. If not I am not sure how it will go. I think this is really a one off. For me it was really strange. So we need to look into it and I hope we can find something for tomorrow. Issue or not it was a surprise to see Leclerc so far down the order. Sebastian Vettel  17th After an impressive run of races for Aston Martin Sebastian Vettel was knocked out in Q1 in Mexico City. The shock wasnt particularly Vettel or teammate Lance Strolls performance but more Aston Martins lack of performance at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez. Aston Martin have scored 24 points in the last three races allowing them to move within three points of Alfa Romeo for sixth in the constructors standings. Seeing both Aston Martins out in Q1 was surprising but a testament to how quickly things can change in F1s midfield. Which F1 drivers had a great day Max Verstappen  1st The reigning world champion saved his best for last in qualifying in Mexico. His pole margin was an enormous threetenths  something that looked very unlikely in the earlier sessions. Verstappen will go in search of his 14th victory of the year and if he wins on Sunday it will be a record for the most wins in a season. It was a good qualifying I think it was a close one Verstappen said I think after FP3 we made a few adjustments on the car and got into a better rhythm and to be on pole here is of course amazing. Of course its a very long run to Turn 1 so we do need a good start. Anyway I think we have a quick car and thats of course whats most important. George Russell  2nd It was the first time since the summer break that George Russell outqualified Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton. Without a mistake in the final sector a second pole of the year could have been his. Regardless it was a welcome return to form for Russell who by his own admission has been below par since the summer break. While Hamilton had his own issues in qualifying it was important for Russell to get back ahead of his teammate and be in a position to attack Verstappen on the first lap. Valtteri Bottas  6th The overall star of qualifying was Bottas. Since introducing several upgrades at Suzuka Alfa Romeo appear to be back to being a top 10 contending outfit. Its timely considering Aston Martins remarkable run of results putting Alfa Romeo under immense pressure in the race for sixth. Bottas hasnt finished inside the top 10 since the Canadian Grand Prix but hes in a great position to end his drought on Sunday.

Red Bull handed $7m fine and wind tunnel penalty by FIA for Formula 1 cost cap breach, https://www.skysports.com/f1/news/12475/12731937/red-bull-handed-7m-fine-and-wind-tunnel-penalty-in-fia-punishment-for-formula-1-cost-cap-breach, Red Bull have been handed a 7 million fine and restrictions on car development time for breaching last seasons Formula 1 cost cap. The FIA acknowledged if a tax credit had been correctly applied Red Bull would have only been 0.5m over. Christian Horner claims that for Red Bull to be accused of fraudulent activity is shocking as he responds to Zak Browns letter. With their penalty Red Bull are set to have 25 runs in their wind tunnel next season instead of 28.

Sky Sports News F1 reporter Craig Slater explains the extent of Red Bulls punishment after accepting a breach of the cost cap rules. Red Bull have been handed a 7 million fine and restrictions on car development time for breaching last seasons Formula 1 cost cap. Following over two weeks of speculation and criticism from rivals after a minor breach of the 145m limit in Max Verstappens maiden titlewinning campaign Red Bull were given their punishments on Friday at the Mexico City GP after reaching an accepted breach agreement ABA with the FIA. The ABA meant Red Bull had to admit their wrongdoing  with the team 2.2m over the cap after inaccurately excluding or adjusting a number of costs  but crucially brought with it an end to an F1 saga and less severe punishments. The FIA acknowledged if a tax credit had been correctly applied Red Bull would have only been 0.5m over. There is no accusation or evidence that Red Bull has sought at any time to act in bad faith dishonestly or in a fraudulent manner nor has it wilfully concealed any information from the Cost Cap Administration read an FIA statement. Red Bull have received both a financial and a minor sporting penalty with a 10 per cent reduction in wind tunnel time over the next 12 months most damaging.

Christian Horner claims that for Red Bull to be accused of fraudulent activity is shocking as he responds to Zak Browns letter. Red Bull were already set to have less time in their wind tunnel  where F1 teams test and perfect aerodynamics on their car  than their rivals due to winning this years constructors championship which they wrapped up last weekend in the USA to follow up Verstappens second drivers title. There is a sliding scale of wind tunnel runs in F1 depending on where a team finishes. With their penalty Red Bull are set to have 25 runs in their wind tunnel next season instead of 28. Ferrari by reference will have 30 runs if they finish second in the championship and Mercedes 32 should they end up third as expected. The constructor in last place has 46 runs. Sky Sports F1 pundit Martin Brundle however said earlier this week that Red Bull could be hit with a 25 per cent reduction in wind tunnel time so some may believe they have got away lightly. The 7m fine is not a reduction in their budget cap for next year which is 135m. Aston Martin meanwhile were also given their punishment on Friday for their procedural breach. The team have been handed a 450000 fine for failing to file accurate full year reporting documentation in respect of 2021. Williams took a fine for a similar breach earlier this year. How did Red Bull go over the limit Red Bull were first accused of a minor breach  an overspend of less than five per cent 7.25m  of F1s newfor2021 cost cap on October 10 and had been in discussions with the FIA since that revelation. The team  amid cheating accusations from McLaren boss Zak Brown and fierce criticism from other rivals  have protested their innocence throughout. Red Bull drivers Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez left and right and team boss Christian Horner 1.7m of their 2.2m overspend has been revealed to be owing to tax issues. It has now been confirmed by the FIA that Red Bull made errors on budget cap costs such as catering social security contributions apprenticeship levies unused spare parts for the car and charging certain costs to Red Bull Power Trains. The FIA pursued an ABA first as per the financial regulations and Red Bull effectively entering a plea bargain ruled out the more severe punishments for a minor breach such as points deductions or a reduction of future caps. In already hugely controversial circumstances Verstappen only beat Lewis Hamilton by eight points for last years drivers crown.

Christian Horner denies that Red Bull have gained any advantage from any cost cap breach and believes the relevant costs are within the cap. If Red Bull had rejected the FIAs terms the case would have gone to the cost cap adjudication panel and the full range of penalties would have been back on the table. After that it could have even escalated to the International Court of Appeals a dragging out of the scandal no one wanted. Analysis Red Bull still feel this is a tough sanction Sky Sports News Craig Slater This is Red Bull saying We accept we are in error we overspent and the FIA have delivered the sanction. Its less of a sanction than a lot of people have been talking about. The wind tunnel reduction of 10 per cent is a lot less than a lot of people were speculating it could have been 25 per cent. My understanding from some soundings within the team is that Red Bull still feel this is quite a tough sanction given they were only slightly over the cap. In the runup to all of this there has been some quite strong words exchanged behind the leading teams  we had Toto Wolff Ferrari and then Zak Brown weighing in on this. In a leaked letter Brown equated breaking the cost cap with cheating. But the FIA statement addresses talk of cheating by saying There is no accusation or evidence that RBR has sought at any time to act in bad faith dishonestly or in a fraudulent manner nor has it concealed wilfully any information from the cost cap administration. And that has been pretty consistent throughout as far as the FIA is concerned. Lets see what the other teams make of this. They cannot appeal this but it wont stop them talking about it.
Wolff: F1 cost cap penalty "too much" for Red Bull "too little" for Mercedes, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/wolff-red-bull-f1-cost-cap-breach-penalty-too-little/10391794/, It was announced today that Red Bull had signed an Accepted Breach Agreement with the governing body. Regarding the Red Bull penalties Wolff added I think any reduction in windtunnel time is going to be detrimental. Wolff agreed that todays outcome will serve as a suitable deterrent for other teams and help to ensure that the cost cap will be respected in future. Toto Wolff Team Principal and CEO Mercedes AMG Photo by Simon Galloway  Motorsport ImagesAsked for his thoughts on Christian Horners explanation of why Red Bull was over the cap Wolff said Nine teams complied with the regulations and stayed below the cap. Wolff praised the FIA for overseeing the cost cap process and ensuring that Red Bull received a stiff penalty suggesting that the outcome showed that nothing was brushed under the carpet., It was announced today that Red Bull had signed an Accepted Breach Agreement with the governing body. As a result it has been docked 10 of its aero testing for 12 months from now and fined 7 million. I think as for any penalty for us its too little Wolff told Autosport. For them it will be too much. Regarding the Red Bull penalties Wolff added I think any reduction in windtunnel time is going to be detrimental. How detrimental is difficult to judge at this stage. I think in absolute terms 7m is a lot of money. But maybe in the bigger scheme of things for Red Bull considering the investment they do on the power unit side and on the team its not. Wolff agreed that todays outcome will serve as a suitable deterrent for other teams and help to ensure that the cost cap will be respected in future. I think that the sum of the penalties is a deterrent the sporting penalty and to a lesser degree the financial fine. But reputational damage that is happening is probably the biggest thing and no team will want to come anywhere near that because obviously we are living in a transparent and compliant world. Our shareholders or our partners demand compliance and in that respect thats just not on anymore. Toto Wolff Team Principal and CEO Mercedes AMG Photo by Simon Galloway  Motorsport Images Asked for his thoughts on Christian Horners explanation of why Red Bull was over the cap Wolff said Nine teams complied with the regulations and stayed below the cap. This is a sport of marginal gains and everything else is just chatter. Theres no mitigating factor. Wolff praised the FIA for overseeing the cost cap process and ensuring that Red Bull received a stiff penalty suggesting that the outcome showed that nothing was brushed under the carpet. What I take as a positive is the strong governance he added. Nothing was brushed under the carpet. The FIA stood by the process. And I think that although the administration has only been in place for 10 months its very encouraging to see things executed. Thats the really positive of the process. Mohammed Ben Sulayem with a strong group of individuals Federico Lodi head of financial regs Shaila Ann Rao interim secretary general for sport and Nikolas Tombazis singleseater technical head ensured that the assessment and the policing of the cost cap was robust. And that is what I take as a positive out of the whole process. What we need to tidy up is the minor and major breaches. I think a breach is a breach. And thats how it should be handled.
Aussie Formula 1 prodigy Jack Doohan laments loss of Daniel Ricciardo for 2023 season, https://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/f1/aussie-formula-1-prodigy-jack-doohan-laments-loss-of-daniel-ricciardo-for-2023-season-c-8695234, Daniel Ricciardos McLaren exit may have offered another young Aussie speed demon a golden Formula 1 opportunity but another rising racing prodigy has lamented the loss of one of the sports role models. By the time Ricciardo attempts to make a return to the grid in 2024 there may well be three Aussies in the field after Jack Doohan continued his remarkable rise through the ranks. The 19yearold made his practice debut in Mexico behind the wheel for Alpine where he is an Academy driver on Saturday morning. Doohan recorded the 19th fastest time and put himself in a prime position to take the reserve driver spot previously occupied by fellow countryman Oscar Piastri.

By the time Ricciardo attempts to make a return to the grid in 2024 there may well be three Aussies in the field after Jack Doohan continued his remarkable rise through the ranks. The 19yearold made his practice debut in Mexico behind the wheel for Alpine where he is an Academy driver on Saturday morning. Son of fivetime legendary MotoGP champion Mick Doohan slotted into Esteban Ocons seat for the opening practice session of the Mexico City Grand Prix as the paddock took a gander at the rising stars of racing. Doohan recorded the 19th fastest time and put himself in a prime position to take the reserve driver spot previously occupied by fellow countryman Oscar Piastri. Doohans rise through the ranks has been inspired by legends such as his father and Michael Schumacher who kickstarted his karting career but he also told Sky Sports he was disappointed Ricciardo did not have a seat for next season. Theres a lot of sadness for Daniel. Hes been the sole Australian on the grid for many years now since Mark left he said. A lot of people are devastated. Theyre really behind Daniel his character inside and outside the car and the enthusiasm he brings to the paddock and the fans is really good for our sport. Hopefully Ricciardos time off is for the right reasons and he can come back in a year or two and it will be for the better. Doohan revealed he attempted to follow in his fathers footsteps but a broken leg convinced him to stick to four wheels.

Credit Chris Graythen  Getty Images I broke my leg when I was five riding bikes  I think that scared me Doohan said. So I kind of stepped aside from the bike and went towards four wheels for a couple of years because one of my buddies was driving a kart. Id had a kart luckily gifted to me by Michael Schumacher because he and dad were quite close friends they were neighbours in Monaco. He came one time to our home in Australia and we had a kart track there so he gifted myself and my sister a gokart for I think  my third birthday it was quite cool. Once I was seven I got back on the four wheels and Im quite thankful for it obviously because Im way too big and wide to be on two wheels. Ricciardos practice sessions continued the disappointing trend of the season finishing 11th fastest in FP1 fifth slowest of the regular drivers. FP2 was not much better with both McLarens outside the top 12.

Alpine’s protest regarding Alonso penalty ruled inadmissible, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.alpines-protest-regarding-alonso-penalty-ruled-inadmissible.513rj0hWXR5ZqlAUHFrCo5.html, The FIA Stewards have ruled that Alpines protest over Haass postrace dispute in Austin is not admissible  but the French manufacturers have requested a right of review over the case. On Sunday night in the United States Haas lodged a protest on the grounds that Alonso and Sergio Perezs cars were in an unsafe condition after separate incidents for those drivers. Perez was not sanctioned but Alonso was given a 30second postrace penalty in Austin as his car was not deemed to be in a safe condition after he had collided with Lance Stroll. The twotime champion was therefore demoted from seventh to 15th. Alpine then disputed Haass protests on the grounds that they had been lodged too late  24 minutes past the specified deadline  but the FIA concluded in Mexico City that there is no ability or right for any party to protest a decision of the Stewards nor against a summons to a hearing., The FIA Stewards have ruled that Alpines protest over Haass postrace dispute in Austin is not admissible  but the French manufacturers have requested a right of review over the case.

The Constructors Cup was clinched by Verstappens Red Bull Racing team at Circuit of the Americas outside Austin Texas this past weekend. Now comes Sundays Mexican Grand Prix and it seems theres not much left to race for except bragging rights. Well actually theres a lot left to race for at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez such as can Charles Leclerc and Ferrari salvage some pride and finish second in the driver standings or can Sergio Perez make it a Red Bull 12 on the season. Perez is out to become the first home driver to win the Mexican Grand Prix while his illustrious teammate is also in search of his 14th win on the season which no F1 driver has ever accomplished Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel hold the record at 13. Obviously a win at his home Grand Prix would go a long way for Perez  known as Checo to his friends and fans  clinching the first runnerup position to Verstappen. Leclerc currently holds a twopoint advantage on Perez. And while it is a case of too little too late the upgrades Mercedes unleashed at the COTA made them very racy indeed so expect Lewis Hamilton and teammate George Russell to not go quietly into the night in these final three races of the calendar.

It is by far the highest elevation the F1 circus will compete at on the 2022 calendar year Interlagos Brazil is the next highest at 4921 feet and as can be imagined the thin air causes issues for not just the drivers but also the cars. It should be a track the Ferraris excel at considering the thinner air means that cars carrying more downforce will suffer less of a penalty and cars with a horsepower advantage may find it harder to breath in that thin air. The signature feature of the track is Turn 17 the Peraltada a banked extremely fast corner that brings the field back to the extremely long front straight. This is also the second of the two DRS zones on the track setting up for dragrace finishes to Turn 1. The first DRS zone is at the exit of the Turn 11 chicane to Turn 12 which is very short. Strategies in the past have seen a onestopper be the winning formula with cars starting on the hardest compound being good 50 laps or more then switching to a softer compound for the sprint to the finish. Whether that compound will be the intermediate or the super soft remains to be discovered by the teams during open practices on Friday and Saturday ahead of Saturdays qualifying. Past races has seen the intermediate last up to 30 laps so that would mean a pit window strategy somewhere in the 20s with the hard compounds then being slipped on for the remainder of the scheduled 71 laps. Or do you go with the super softs hope to get at least 20 laps then go to the hard compounds Red Bull Racing has proven to be adept at saving its tires most likely due to the fact that the cars seem to be running far less downforce than Ferrari and other challengers so perhaps this will be the roll of the dice team principal Christian Horner takes at Mexico City.

F1 faces legal challenge over Bahrain contract and sportswashing, https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/oct/27/f1-faces-legal-challenge-over-over-bahrain-contract-and-sportswashing, Yusuf was detained and abused in prison after peaceful criticism of F1 in Bahrain in 2017 and Bird maintains Mansoor was also detained and mistreated at the same time. Bird has been campaigning to ensure F1 sticks to its commitment to respect human rights issues where it holds races. The pressure group says it has received no satisfactory response to its calls for F1 to investigate human rights issues in Bahrain and believes repression around the race has steadily become worse. In February F1 agreed a new deal with Bahrain to host the race until 2036 the longest contract in the sports history sparking Bird to adopt a formal legal approach. The Human Rights Watch group is to publish a report next week entitled You Cant Call Bahrain a Democracy Bahrains Political Isolation Laws., Formula One faces a legal complaint accusing it of breaching Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development guidelines after the sport concluded a deal this year extending its contract to hold races in Bahrain until 2036. The complaint made through the British governments UK National Contact Point NCP which addresses issues of responsible business conduct has been served by the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy Bird and two alleged torture survivors from Bahrain Najah Yusuf and Hajer Mansoor. Yusuf was detained and abused in prison after peaceful criticism of F1 in Bahrain in 2017 and Bird maintains Mansoor was also detained and mistreated at the same time.

In February F1 agreed a new deal with Bahrain to host the race until 2036 the longest contract in the sports history sparking Bird to adopt a formal legal approach. The complaint alleges Formula One failed to engage with human rights stakeholders including human rights organisations legislators from across Europe victims impacted by the Formula One race and those who have faced reprisals for their human rights work. It accuses F1 of having failed to conduct a due diligence process in assessment of human rights before awarding the new contract and alleges that forced disappearances extrajudicial killing and torture continue to occur in Bahrain. AntiF1 graffiti in the village of Barbar west of Manama the capital of Bahrain in 2012. Photograph Hamad I MohammedReuters The complaint specifically accuses F1 of being complicit in sportswashing noting that the regime has used the event to promote a public display of unity within the kingdom over one of suppression. It alleges that F1 intensifies this oppression stating The race has been responsible for a considerable spike in human rights abuses as the government acts to forestall and suppress protest around the time of the race. The intent of pursuing legal action through the UK NCP is to force the issue to the OECD which then may take action against F1. Part of the impetus behind the sport implementing a human rights policy was because of a previous complaint made by the NCP and Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei director of advocacy at Bird hoped this too would provoke action from F1.

It appears that Formula One has taken the decision to disengage with any stakeholders in violation of their own policy and has estranged themselves from all experts who attempt to warn them about the serious human rights risks posed by their activities in Bahrain he said. Our repeated attempts to engage with F1 have fallen on deaf ears particularly since 2021 only to later learn that in the wake of Bahrains horrific human rights abuses they had been busy awarding the regime with the longest contract in motor racing history. We are now escalating the matter by taking it before the UK NCP. Next year Bahrain is set to hold the opening race of next season and its only preseason test but criticism of the regime is intensifying. The Human Rights Watch group is to publish a report next week entitled You Cant Call Bahrain a Democracy Bahrains Political Isolation Laws. It will document the Bahraini governments use of political isolation laws and other tactics to keep activists and opposition members out of public office and public life in what are described as further human rights abuses. Bahrain has spent the last decade cracking down on peaceful opposition and the political isolation laws are yet another example of the governments repression expanding into new spheres said Joey Shea Middle East and North Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch. These draconian laws have made a mockery of Bahrains upcoming parliamentary elections which can neither be free nor fair when you make any political opposition essentially illegal.

Mercedes have endured a hugelydisappointing campaign following the introduction of new design regulations and saw their eightyear streak of constructors championships officially ended on Sunday as Red Bull added the title to Max Verstappens second successive drivers crown. After an encouraging display in Austin whether or not Mercedes can win one of the final three races  starting in Mexico this weekend  has been a hot topic of discussion but the seventime world champion is not confident. Hamilton pointed to the fact that his strong race performance was aided by being boosted to third on the grid because of penalties for Ferraris Charles Leclerc and Red Bulls Sergio Perez. I think we really need to be realistic Hamilton said. The Red Bull car has been the fastest car by far all year and it is still the fastest car.

Hamilton is aiming to break the tie with Michael Schumacher in his 16th campaign this year. His hopes of victory in Austin were further boosted when Verstappen was held stationary for 11 seconds during his second and final pit stop which saw the Red Bull driver drop around seven seconds behind the Brit with Leclerc also between them.

Despite his concerns over Mercedes ability to compete for a win Rosberg says he has been hugely impressed by Hamiltons driving along with his teammate George Russell. Lewis is driving at the top of his game as always added Rosberg who beat Hamilton to the 2016 world championship before retiring.

Also to do it within the budget cap such a big challenge and theyve really made great progress.

That was for Dietrich said an emotional Verstappen. I gave it everything out there even if we had that slow stop. Max Verstappen celebrates with Red Bull racing chief Helmut Marko Source AFP Red Bull team chief Christian Horner said It is a very emotional moment a big moment for the team and for everyone at Red Bull  a tribute to Dietrich for everything he has done for the team for the company...

A minutes applause in tribute to Mateschitz preceded the prerace anthem before the lights went out and Verstappen quickly seized the initiative as Sainz struggled to depart from pole.

Leclerc advanced to second when Hamilton pitted on lap 35 for fresh hards rejoining sixth. Hamiltons undercut forced Verstappen to respond one lap later but he had a slow stop taking more than 11 seconds to take a set of medium tyres. Russell and Leclerc also stopped again as a frustrated Verstappen rejoined fifth until passing Leclerc on lap 39. All this left Vettel leading until Hamilton dived inside him at the start of lap 41 to take over with 15 laps remaining. Hamilton fought to keep alive his dream of a first win this year. By lap 49 Hamiltons lead was down to 0.7. A pass was inevitable and it came on lap 50.

Alonso wrote on Instagram It is an important day for the sport as this decision will dictate if we are going in the right direction.

A protest by Alonsos Alpine team against the decision to demote him out of the points after he finished seventh in a damaged car will be heard on Thursday. Alonso wrote on Instagram It is an important day for the sport as this decision will dictate if we are going in the right direction. Alonso said his post was in response to messages of support since the penalty. He thanked those who had contacted him on social media adding Its one of those rare times in sport that I feel we are all on the same page and share the same opinion towards rules and regulations. Alonso said after the race that he considered his drive one of the best of his career after he crashed at 180mph his car did a wheelie hit a wall he pitted for a new front wing resumed at the back and climbed to seventh despite damaged aerodynamic parts. The twotime champion has questioned the decisionmaking of officials on a number of occasions this year and his frustrations about the inconsistency of policing of action on track are shared by the majority of his fellow drivers. At the Spanish Grand Prix he accused the FIA of incompetence and lacking knowledge of racing. Criticism of the FIAs running of F1 has been a theme this year and the US Grand Prix was the race after the governing body angered drivers by allowing a recovery vehicle on track in conditions of poor visibility during heavy rain. Alpines appeal will be heard at 1800 Mexico City time 1200 BST on 27 October before this weekends Mexican Grand Prix. The team have questioned the US GP stewards decision to allow a protest by the Haas team despite it being posted after the permitted time limit had expired. The stewards said in their decision to hand Alonso a 30second penalty on Sunday that the Spaniards car was in an unsafe condition because he drove it for some time with a damaged wing mirror and then without one when it fell off. Haas pointed out their cars have previously been given the blackandorange warning flag  demanding a car is pitted for repairs  on three occasions in similar situations this season. At no point during the race were Alpine asked by officials to pit the car and remove the mirror despite calls from Haas to race control. The stewards ruling suggests that any car missing a rearview mirror after an incident will be forced to retire in future. There are also questions about the consistency of decisionmaking after stewards rejected a similar protest by Haas against Sergio Perezs Red Bull. Perez drove some laps with a damaged front wing part of which then fell off the car while he was running.

But Ricciardo says emphatically that he does not have a deal in place even though he is working on the possibility. I dont he said when asked by The Race if he has a reserve driver role lined up for next season. This would fit in with a reserve role is it would allow him to attend some races and potentially take what limited testing opportunities are available. Ovals scare me said Ricciardo when asked why he does not plan to race in IndyCar if he cant get an F1 seat., Daniel Ricciardo says talks are ongoing about a potential Formula 1 reserve driver role in 2023 as he works to lay the foundations for a racing return in 2024. The McLaren driver admitted at Suzuka earlier this month that he wont be on the grid next year but remains determined to continue his F1 career the following season. There were suggestions on Saturday at Austin that he had agreed a reserve deal for next year with one of F1s bigger teams potentially his former employer Red Bull. But Ricciardo says emphatically that he does not have a deal in place even though he is working on the possibility. I dont he said when asked by The Race if he has a reserve driver role lined up for next season. For now everythings just rumours. Am I talking Yes but theres no pen on paper or anything like that. Any reserve role Ricciardo takes would likely have to be with one of F1s big three teams especially given F1s fourth and fifth placed teams  Alpine and McLaren  rejected him for 2023. Somethings up. This isnt normal  Ricciardo interview Read more A move into the Red Bull camp would be a surprise given he left there at the end of 2018 and the team would not have a race seat vacancy before 2025 given the twoyear deal Sergio Perez agreed earlier this year. Mercedes and Ferrari could potentially have capacity for Ricciardo as a reserve although the former is the only team that could have a race seat space in 2024 given Lewis Hamilton is out of contract at the end of next year. However recent indications are that Hamilton is keen to continue in the longer term. Ricciardo also confirmed that he expects to still be around in F1 next season given his determination to make a comeback in the future. This would fit in with a reserve role is it would allow him to attend some races and potentially take what limited testing opportunities are available. I will still be around because I still have ambitions for 2024 so I wont completely disconnect from the sport he said. But obviously nothings guaranteed for 24. I dont have a seat that I can say Im going to definitely be driving but Ill still be around and trying to put work in to be back. Could Ricciardo really return to F1 after a 2023 sabbatical Read more Ricciardo also stressed that even with uncertainty about 2024 Im better off sticking to the plan I have and aiming for something else next year rather than pursuing a race seat next year with Haas the only team yet to have confirmed its second driver. He has said repeatedly that his sole focus is F1 and that he has no intention of racing in other categories next season. But he specifically ruled out the possibility of making a move into IndyCar fulltime seemingly for the long term given he says he does not want to race on ovals. Ovals scare me said Ricciardo when asked why he does not plan to race in IndyCar if he cant get an F1 seat. My Formula 1 careerslashambition is not over so thats really first and foremost. 10 F1toIndyCar moves Grosjean can learn from Read more I dont want to deviate I would say primarily for that reason. But also ovals no. Ten years ago I would have said yes but Im OK to admit that Im not OK with ovals. He said that while racing in IndyCar on a roadstreet course programme as old F1 rival Romain Grosjean did in 2021 before expanding to a full season this year does look fun he has not entertained the possibility because of his focus on F1. He added that the romanticising part of it America and all that would be fun but its more of a fantasy.

The pit problem gave Hamilton a chance to end his and Mercedes win drought in a difficult season for the team. But the pace of the new world champion was just too much and Verstappen caught and passed Hamilton with six laps to go the seventime champion defenceless against the formidable straightline speed of the Red Bull. Verstappens 13th win this year equals the record for wins in a season held by Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel and was sufficient for Red Bull to clinch the constructors title for the first time since 2013 securing a double after Verstappen clinched the drivers title last time out in Japan.

Source Getty Images The F1 world continues to wait for a decision on a potential cost cap punishment for Red Bull as actions gets back underway on the track in qualifying for the United States Grand Prix. Red Bull boss Christian Horner and FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem were spotted speaking in the paddock on Saturday for around 15 minutes according to Sky Sports. Red Bull was confirmed to have committed a minor breach of the 145 million spending limit but there is still yet to be any official announcement on a punishment for those actions. Rival teams are certainly pushing for Red Bull to be penalised with McLaren team boss Zak Brown labelling it cheating while Ferrari urged for maximum penalties. Mercedes George Russell meanwhile said the breach was almost disrespectful given some staff had been made redundant by teams who tried to stick to the cap. George Russell said the breach was almost disrespectful. Photo by Mark ThompsonGetty Images Source Getty Images If theres a ruleset there it needs to be stuck to Russell told Sky F1s Ted Kravitz. Youve got nine or eight teams that have worked incredibly hard to stick to those rules compromised many things people being made redundant. Youve got development there ready to go but the finances arent there because youd go over the cost cap. To then learn that some people have ignored those regulations and done as they please is obviously very hurtful and almost disrespectful in a way to so many people who have put the time and effort in to stay within it who have lost their jobs because of it. Were going to find out what the FIA needs to do but I trust in them to do what is right. If not I dont know what it means for the cost cap but I think its in everyones interest for this sport that it gets dealt with properly. The cost cap drama will continue to bubble away in the background as the action on the track continues with Carlos Sainz outpacing Max Verstappen in the opening free practice. Teammate Charles Leclerc also topped the second practice also Sainz said there is still room for Ferrari to improve ahead of qualifying. Huge disappointment Brown talks Dan  0228 We were definitely on the pace today Sainz said. It hasnt been an easy day with the bumps its always challenging here in Austin to have a good balance and to have a good ride over the kerbs and bumps. But in general even if it wasnt the most comfortable car to drive out there we were quick which is what counts. Theres still a bit of work to do on the car for tomorrow especially FP3 where we need to test a couple of things that we couldnt test in FP2 because of the Pirelli test  so a few things are on the checklist. Lewis Hamilton was third in the opening practice and was full of praise for Mercedes after receiving a host of upgrades ahead of this weekends race including a new rear wing endplate. Everything went to plan and firstly Im super grateful to everyone back at the factory for working so hard and bringing us an upgrade this weekend he said. Its been a tough year for everyone at the factory and for them to continuously be pushing and keeping their heads out and pulling out these new pieces Im super grateful. Im hoping we make some changes tonight and tomorrow well see where we stand. But it doesnt feel like were too far from everybody. Follow all the action from qualifying below Cant see it Click here
Toto Wolff the Compulsive Perfectionist Behind Mercedes’s Formula 1 Team, https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/10/31/toto-wolff-the-compulsive-perfectionist-behind-mercedes-formula-1-team, Two Formula 1 drivers were killed in the span of three years at Zandvoort in the seventies. Last years Mexican Grand Prix attracted three hundred and seventy thousand spectators. The Dutch Grand Prix was the fifteenth of the season and Mercedess best results so far were a couple of secondplace finishes. Weve not gone from being an eighttimewinning worldchampionship team to not being able to build cars Hamilton said. Under normal circumstances the Grand Prix would have finished behind the safety car with the race order intact., Content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. A few minutes before the start of the Dutch Grand Prix which was held last month in baking sunshine at Zandvoort a beachside racetrack within commuting distance of Amsterdam Toto Wolff the principal of the MercedesAMG Petronas Formula 1 team walked out onto the starting grid. A Grand Prix begins when a row of five red lights above the start line is extinguished but for a short time before the track is a twentythousandhorsepower mob scene. Each of the unearthly longnosed machines is attended by a mobile I.C.U. of generators steel trolleys laptops tire blankets and uniformed mechanics in crash helmets and flameproof gear. Umbrellas shroud the drivers cockpits. Billionaires stalk the grid. Race marshals hold clipboards in red gloves. The noise is beyond belief helicopter blades highspeed wheel guns the desperate howls of the cars the massed emanations of the waiting crowd. In Zandvoort loudspeakers laced the sky with dance music. The afternoon was humid the air felt saturated. Wolff was at home. He is tall dark and Austrian. He could pass for a Sacha Baron Cohen character or for someone who breezes past you in the airport smelling good wearing loafers and no socks. He worked the grid in a white shirt emblazoned with the Mercedes star and the logos of twelve other corporate sponsors black pants teamissued Puma sneakers lovable smile. He kissed peoples cheeks touched elbows gave impromptu TV interviews and yelled lastminute thoughts to his drivers. Somewhere in the fumes was death. Two Formula 1 drivers were killed in the span of three years at Zandvoort in the seventies. At one point I found myself by the pit lane when three cars leaped out red taillights flashing. The speed was like a whip. Wolff who is fifty is the best team boss in the recent history of the worlds fastest motorsport. The formula of Formula 1 refers to a set of rules first enshrined after the Second World War to bring some order to the urge to race dangerous cars on the asphalt of foreign cities. Whereas Nascar is all left turns cars that look like cars and spectatorfriendly oval tracks Formula 1 has a madder purer heart the oldest courses date from a century ago. Races last around ninety minutes. They twist sweep and go down hills sometimes on existing streets. The cars which started out as death traps for daredevils are now specimens of extreme technology flying algorithms that fight for advantages of a hundredth of a secondthe distance of a yard over a threemile track. The sport is esoteric but globally so. Last years Mexican Grand Prix attracted three hundred and seventy thousand spectators. The Singapore race runs through the city at night. Drivers can shed six pounds in stress and sweat. The average television audience for a Formula 1 race is around seventy million peoplefour times that of the typical N.F.L. gameand the best drivers earn soccerstar salaries and lasting fame. When Ayrton Senna a threetime world champion was killed in a race in 1994 the Brazilian government declared three days of mourning. A million people waited in the heat to pay their respects and many spoke of their saudadean inexpressible state of longing for something that is gone. And heres where I can tell youll never amount to anything. Facebook Twitter Email Shopping Cartoon by Stephen Raaka Between 2014 when Wolff took charge of Mercedes and 2021 the team won the world championship eight years in a rowan unprecedented achievement. In Formula 1 there is a constructors championship for the most successful team and a drivers championship awarded at the end of some twenty races. Each team has two drivers. Mercedess star is Lewis Hamilton who earned around sixtyfive million dollars last season. During the teams winning streak Hamilton won six individual world titles bringing his career total to seven. No one has ever won eight. I couldnt think of a better friend. I couldnt think of a better boss Hamilton told me of Wolff. Formula 1 is currently surging in popularity particularly in the United States in part because of a Netflix series Drive to Survive which has embroidered the nerdery of the sport with artful camerawork and bitchy insight into the lives of its protagonists. Wolff who speaks five languages and whose wife Susie is a former racing driver is one of the shows natural stars. Of the ten team principals in the sport only Wolff and his archrival Christian Horner a Briton who runs the Red Bull team have ever won a world championship. But unlike Horner and the rest of his peers Wolff is also a coowner of his team. His onethird stake in Mercedes is conservatively valued at around five hundred million dollars. He sees himself simultaneously as a competitor and as someone who is shaping the future of a multibilliondollar business. The other team principals and I dont mean this in an arrogant way are incentivized for performance only Wolff said. His rivals see this. Hes playing a game and he is always one move in advance one of them told me. But this season Wolff and Mercedes have failed to win a single race. The Dutch Grand Prix was the fifteenth of the season and Mercedess best results so far were a couple of secondplace finishes. In 2020 the team won thirteen out of seventeen. Hamilton who joined Formula 1 as a rookie in 2007 has never gone a season without winning at least one race. Ahead of the U.S. Grand Prix in Austin on October 23rd the team was languishing in third place behind Red Bull and Ferrariits worst position in a decade. Seeing Wolff and Mercedes lose their way has been as disconcerting as it has been refreshing like watching Roger Federer shank his serve the Yankees miss the playoffs Simone Biles miss the beam. It is understandable up to a point. Weve not gone from being an eighttimewinning worldchampionship team to not being able to build cars Hamilton said. We just . . . its wrong this year. The ostensible reason was a change in the rules. Every few years the Fdration Internationale de lAutomobile which has overseen Grand Prix racing since 1906 forces the teams to redesign their cars. Normally the official logic has to do with safety or with making it easier for cars to overtake one another but there is almost always an unspoken motive to upset the existing order of things and to stop one team from gaining a permanent advantage. In the past Mercedes profited from these changes adapting faster than its rivals. But the 2022 reset was unusually farreaching. One of the aims of the new rules was to reconfigure the downforce generated by the cars to reduce the amount of dirty air left in their wakes and to allow for closer racing. At a preseason testing event in Bahrain in March Mercedess new carthe W13appeared to embody the boldest interpretation of this idea. It was skinnier and more futuristic than the rest. People were looking at that thinking Wow. Mercedes are going to blow the field away George Russell the teams other driver told me. Within reason we thought that as well. But the W13 proved capricious. Data collected in the wind tunnel or through computer modelling didnt pan out on the track. At high speeds the car bounced an effect known as porpoising. My back is killing me Hamilton yelled on a long straight in Baku in June where the floor of the car repeatedly hit the asphalt at more than two hundred miles per hour. Attempts to resolve the issue only uncovered more problems. Weve tried and tried and failed. And tried and tried and failed Hamilton said. Andrew Shovlin Mercedess tracksideengineering director who has a Ph.D. in the dynamics of military logistics vehicles compared fixing the W13 to peeling an onion. Even the aerodynamic bouncing manifests itself in about three different mechanisms he said. The other reason for Mercedess poor performance was a sense of injustice and doom. In 2021 with five laps remaining in the final race of the season Hamilton was leading the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on his way to an eighth individual world title and solitary greatness. Hamilton had won the previous three races he had the car on a string. He was unbeatable and we were unbeatable Wolff said. On lap fiftythree in Abu Dhabi the race was interrupted by a crash and then a safety car took over. In Formula 1 when there is a hazard on the track a sports car with flashing lights leads a stately jumbled procession of cars until the danger is cleared. Under normal circumstances the Grand Prix would have finished behind the safety car with the race order intact. But the race director an F.I.A. official named Michael Masi made the decision to divert a group of cars to enable a final lap of racing between Hamilton and the secondplace driver Max Verstappen of Red Bull. The drivers were equal in points in the worldchampionship standings. Verstappen was on fresh tires he slipped past Hamilton and took the title. The F.I.A. later concluded that Masi had made a human error and he left his post. But the result stood.

Horner: Verstappen 2022 season the most dominant I've seen, https://www.formulanerds.com/news/horner-verstappen-2022-season-the-most-dominant-ive-seen/, Latest Episode  Cut To The Race PodcastRed Bull boss Christian Horner believes that Max Verstappens 2022 season is the most dominant season that he has witnessed. However Verstappen recently set a new record winning 14 races in a single season. However Red Bull boss Christian Horner believes that Verstappens 2022 season has been the most dominant on individual terms. Comparison between Verstappen and VettelWhilst comparing two of Red Bulls best drivers Horner believes that Verstappen is not getting the credit that he deserves. The Austrian team have now won five constructors championships and Verstappen is now on two drivers championships., Latest Episode  Cut To The Race Podcast Red Bull boss Christian Horner believes that Max Verstappens 2022 season is the most dominant season that he has witnessed. Horner has witnessed some dominant displays from Sebastian Vettel in the early 2010s. The German won four consecutive championships from 20102013 with the Austrian team. Vettel broke multiple records during the four seasons including nine race wins in a row in 2013. This record is still yet to be broken. The fourtime world champion also claimed the most pole positions in 2011 with 15. Furthermore he had the most wins in a season with 13 alongside Michael Schumacher. However Verstappen recently set a new record winning 14 races in a single season. The Dutchman secured his 14th victory in Mexico taking Red Bulls 2022 victories to 16 in total. The most dominant individual performance in a campaign In terms of dominance Mercedes had won the constructors championship eight times in a row from 20142021. However Red Bull boss Christian Horner believes that Verstappens 2022 season has been the most dominant on individual terms. The 50yearold has experienced Vettel giving them glory with pure dominance. The Briton gives his reasoning as to why he thinks Verstappens season has been the most dominant saying Theres been years of domination with Mercedes but I think as an individual driver probably yes. Hes won the most grands prix in a year now within 22 races. On top of that hes won two sprint races and hes not won all of them from pole position. Hes had to fight and race for a lot of those victories. Horner also says that Verstappen hasnt put a wheel wrong and that he has been perfect throughout the season. The Red Bull boss also acknowledges the Dutchmans level of consistency throughout the 2022 season. Comparison between Verstappen and Vettel Whilst comparing two of Red Bulls best drivers Horner believes that Verstappen is not getting the credit that he deserves. The 50yearold also believes that the pair are two completely different drivers. They are two very different drivers two phenomenally successful drivers. I think that what Sebastian has achieved in his career puts him amongst one of the greats and most successful drivers in the sport. However Horner alludes to Verstappens season to something special I actually think his achievements sometimes dont receive the plaudits that they should because I think actually what weve witnessed this year is an absolutely outstanding performance from a driver that is very much at the top of his game. Huge praise for Red Bull Horner also believes that Red Bull are due some huge praise for allowing drivers such as Vettel and Verstappen to shine in Formula 1. The Austrian team have now won five constructors championships and Verstappen is now on two drivers championships. I think the DNA of our team is that were a race team. Were a team of racers we push the boundaries. Were aggressive in the way that we go racing and we follow our passion which is to go out there and do our very very best. We are following Dietrichs Mateschitz mantra of no risk no fun. Verstappen could win the last two races of the season to take the tally up to 16 wins. Do you think the Dutchman can achieve it Feature Image Credit Clive Mason  Formula 1Formula 1 via Getty Images

Speaking about the cost cap drama Red Bulls Motorsport Advisor Helmut Marko spoke of the politics involved and believed that a draconian penalty was applied due to pressure from rival teams. Because the cost cap was applied for the first time this draconian penalty was imposed here of course also under pressure from the other teams Marko told RTL. After all information went out in advance that we didnt have that actually only one team had. Of course theres a lot of politics involved Marko added pointedly at Mercedes.

Audi F1 tie-up a "game-changer" for Sauber says Vasseur, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/audi-f1-tie-up-a-game-changer-for-sauber-says-vasseur/10396691/, Because we will have this kind of partnership and I think F1 is getting more and more difficult. Although F1s financial model has changed thanks to the arrival of the cost cap Vasseur thinks that the levels of money involved are still beyond what a nonmanufacturer team can afford. Frederic Vasseur Team Principal Alfa Romeo Racing Photo by FIA PoolWe are still far away from the budget cap he said. That means that we are fighting to be at the budget cap and even in this we are still far away on that. I think we will touch the point later on but we are still far away from the budget cap., Following months of speculation it was announced shortly before the recent Mexican Grand Prix that Audi had chosen Sauber as its partner for when the German car manufacturer enters F1s new engine rules era. Sauber has had works partnerships in the past  most famously with BMW from 2006 to 2009  and current team principal Vasseur thinks Audis offerings will help the operation make big leaps forward in competitiveness. On the shortterm view first it wont have a big impact except for us knowing that we can go to the next level and it will be a huge opportunity in terms of recruitment and be more attractive also for the sponsors for the future explained Vasseur. But midterm for sure its a gamechanger. Because we will have this kind of partnership and I think F1 is getting more and more difficult. F1 took a huge step up in the last 10 years and to stay as an independent team today is quite impossible from my point of view. It was probably the best option we could take and we are more than happy to have this kind of deal for the future. Although F1s financial model has changed thanks to the arrival of the cost cap Vasseur thinks that the levels of money involved are still beyond what a nonmanufacturer team can afford. Frederic Vasseur Team Principal Alfa Romeo Racing Photo by FIA Pool We are still far away from the budget cap he said. That means that we are fighting to be at the budget cap and even in this we are still far away on that. I think we will touch the point later on but we are still far away from the budget cap. And we are absolutely dependent on the results. If you want to have a longterm view and you have only three or four independent teams it will become more and more difficult. Vasseur said that the plan for Audis arrival was for its engine to be produced at its Neuburg facility in Germany with the chassis element continuing to be manufactured in Switzerland. We will split operations completely he said. They will be in charge of the engine in Neuburg and the team will take care of the chassis and the operations on track from Hinwil. That is clear. They will take some shares in the company in the future. But we havent disclosed the details of this and I wont do it today. I think its a good way to operate the team. We had a look at what was working in the past at other teams and the most important thing for me is not just the setup in terms of shares or who is managing who its a matter of mindset. And to be able to build up in terms of strategy to be one single team and not to have teams fighting each other.

Asked about that allDutch experience and his relationship with Verstappen during an appearance on F1s Beyond The Grid podcast De Vries explained Weve known each other since we were kids. Weve grown up in the same era of racing. We  I think  approached karting and racing in our earlier years very similarly. Verstappen and De Vries shared a race track competitively for the first time at this years Italian Grand Prix We both travelled around in a van with our dads. We just really respected each other and saw each other every weekend pretty much. But strangely because Max is obviously two years younger than me we never raced against each other. Monza was actually the first time in our lives we raced against each other. Ironically we even ended up next to each other on the grid. We were texting about it the evening prior to the race on Saturday evening and we were texting again on Sunday morning.

Horner: Verstappen’s F1 campaign the most dominant I’ve seen, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/horner-verstappens-campaign-the-most-dominant-ive-seen-in-f1/10396623/, And while single team domination is quite common in grand prix racing Horner reckons that the nature of Verstappens charge stands out this year. Hes won the most grands prix in a year now within 22 races. On top of that hes won two sprint races and hes not won all of them from pole position. Comparing the two drivers Horner reckons that Verstappen is not given the praise he deserves considering just how well he is performing right now. But I think Max what were seeing today and this year were actually witnessing something very special., Listen to this article As well as securing his second F1 drivers crown in 2022 Verstappen has with 14 grands prix wins taken the world record for the most victories in a campaign. And while single team domination is quite common in grand prix racing Horner reckons that the nature of Verstappens charge stands out this year. Asked if he felt 2022 was the most dominant campaign from a single driver that he had ever seen Horner said Theres been years of domination with Mercedes but I think as an individual driver probably yes. Hes won the most grands prix in a year now within 22 races. On top of that hes won two sprint races and hes not won all of them from pole position. Hes had to fight and race for a lot of those victories. I think when we look back at the end of the year it is an absolutely outstanding year that Max has driven. He hasnt put a wheel wrong. Hes been perfect throughout the season. Its incredible the level of consistency that hes been able to achieve. Red Bull celebrates Max Verstappens second world title in Japan. Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images With Red Bull having won the constructors championship its title double is the first since the glory years it enjoyed with Sebastian Vettel from 2010 to 2013. Comparing the two drivers Horner reckons that Verstappen is not given the praise he deserves considering just how well he is performing right now. They are two very different drivers two phenomenally successful drivers he said. I think that what Sebastian has achieved in his career puts him amongst one of the greats and most successful drivers in the sport. But I think Max what were seeing today and this year were actually witnessing something very special. I actually think his achievements sometimes dont receive the plaudits that they should because I think actually what weve witnessed this year is an absolutely outstanding performance from a driver that is very much at the top of his game. Horner also believes that Red Bull deserves some credit for having helped produce the cars and performance to have allowed drivers like Verstappen and Vettel to shine. Theres a lot of people sitting around the engineering office and the garage and back at the factory that are all the same people that did that with Sebastian that are doing it again with Max he said. I think the DNA of our team is that were a race team. Were a team of racers we push the boundaries. Were aggressive in the way that we go racing and we follow our passion which is to go out there and do our very very best. We are following Dietrichs Mateschitz mantra of no risk no fun.

International Automobile Federation FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem said a female steward recently received death threats while staff had been targeted with harassment and hate posts for years. The level of sustained toxicity has reached crisis point. It is time for all of us to unite  and to act he said in an oped piece published on motorsport.com and the FIA website. Spanish race steward Silvia Bellot was targeted after compatriot and double world champion Fernando Alonso was penalised at the U.S. Grand Prix in Austin and then reinstated a few days later on review. Ben Sulayem said such abuse had a devastating effect on the mental health of officials and volunteers without whom there would be no racing. Also Read Hamilton becomes honorary citizen of Brazil before Brazilian GP It is utterly deplorable that a volunteer such as Silvia or any of our marshals and officials who volunteer their time to allow us to go racing is the subject of such hatred he wrote. We have to ask ourselves who would want to pursue becoming a top official in this environment The reality is obvious  if this continues it will destroy our sport.

Marko Horner say 'six teams' over 2022 budget cap, https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/red-bull/news/marko-horner-say-six-teams-over-2022-budget-cap_499190.html, The budget cap saga may be about to boil over Red Bulls top Austrian official Dr Helmut Marko warns.

So far the budget cap hasnt changed anything at all., The budget cap saga may be about to boil over Red Bulls top Austrian official Dr Helmut Marko warns. The budget cap saga may be about to boil over Red Bulls top Austrian official Dr Helmut Marko warns. In the days before the Brazilian GP it emerged that Sky Sports Formula 1 producer Billy McGinty visited Red Bulls UK factory to smooth over strained relations as a result of allegedly biased budget cap coverage. It is believed officials of Liberty Mediaowned Formula 1 were also involved in the talks in the wake of Red Bulls 7 million fine and wind tunnel penalty for the 2021 budget overspend. Marko though thinks the budget cap saga is only just beginning. I think the current status is that six teams are over it he told Auto Motor und Sport when asked if a similar story will break out over the 2022 cap. Inflation is something that was not calculable to that extent especially when it comes to the energy costs. Both Marko and Red Bull team boss Christian Horner however insist that Red Bull will be among the four teams who manage to stay below the cap this time. Energy prices have been increasing exponentially but thankfully weve been protected from that Horner said recently. There is that chance that several teams many of which have stated it during F1 Commission meetings will break the cap this year. Unsurprisingly Marko has mixed feelings about the budget cap and whether the measure has even been effective. So far the budget cap hasnt changed anything at all. You just have to develop better than the others he said. Of course it hurts us to have fewer wind tunnel hours which we already have after winning the constructors championship. But in the end it always comes down to the quality of the staff. For the first year the rules were vague and they reacted late with clarifications. We had Ernst and Young check everything and thought we had a safety net of three million. In the end it was only 400000. With that money they make a front wing for Hamilton while Haas makes a whole new car he laughed.
Daniel Ricciardo targeting big reserve role move but some teams still undecided, https://www.formulanerds.com/news/daniel-ricciardo-targeting-big-reserve-role-move-but-some-teams-still-undecided/, As an 8time Grand Prix winner there once was a time when Daniel Ricciardo was in high demand. In an effort to get back to the front of the grid Ricciardo has reportedly spoke to a few teams about a potential reserve driver role most notably Mercedes and Red Bull. For us we very much like him hes a great character said Mercedes CEO Toto Wolff told Autosport. Wolff added His personality and experience in F1 would be really advantageous to any team that worked with him next year. I want to take the time necessary keep a little bit of distance to the sport and lets say rebuild myself Ricciardo told Autosport., Latest Episode  Cut To The Race Podcast Daniel Ricciardo has already confirmed he will not be on the grid in 2023 but the F1 rumour mill is buzzing with a potential move to Mercedes or Red Bull as a reserve driver. As an 8time Grand Prix winner there once was a time when Daniel Ricciardo was in high demand. But after a disastrous run with McLaren the Aussie is taking a step back from a fulltime race seat with the view of making a heroic return in 2024. In an effort to get back to the front of the grid Ricciardo has reportedly spoke to a few teams about a potential reserve driver role most notably Mercedes and Red Bull. For us we very much like him hes a great character said Mercedes CEO Toto Wolff told Autosport. But we are not in a position yet to decide who is going to be reserve and third driver. Former F2 and Formula E champ Nyck de Vries was Mercedes previous reserve driver but after an impressive performance at Monza and several FP1 outings the Dutchman has been snapped up by AlphaTauri for 2023. Wolff added His personality and experience in F1 would be really advantageous to any team that worked with him next year. But I dont want to put any rumours out there because we havent decided. Ricciardo himself is aiming to hit the reset button after failing to perform at McLaren since his move from Renault at the end of 2020. Despite falling short against his teammate Lando Norris Ricciardo has shown glimpses of brilliance winning at Monza in 2021 and most recently claiming a P7 finish in Mexico  both worthy driver of the day performances. I want to take the time necessary keep a little bit of distance to the sport and lets say rebuild myself Ricciardo told Autosport. But then yeah if something makes sense in 24 come back with a vengeance and have some fun and hopefully race at the front.

Red Bull's Helmut Marko aims dig at Lewis Hamilton over cost breach comments - 'He builds a new front wing with that', https://www.eurosport.com/formula-1/brazilian-grand-prix/2019/red-bull-s-helmut-marko-aims-dig-at-lewis-hamilton-over-cost-breach-comments-he-builds-a-new-front-w_sto9218487/story.shtml, Red Bull adviser Helmut Marko has aimed a dig at Lewis Hamilton for suggesting that the British teams overspend last season couldve contributed to a different outcome in the title race.

But then we would see Red Bull every weekend or every other weekend bringing upgrades. Haas who also criticised Red Bull make a whole new car. But Red Bull Racing is the groups strongest and most efficient marketing tool., Red Bull adviser Helmut Marko has aimed a dig at Lewis Hamilton for suggesting that the British teams overspend last season couldve contributed to a different outcome in the title race. Max Verstappen snatched a highly controversial win in the final race of the 2021 campaign to secure the title with thenrace director Michael Masi ruled to have incorrectly applied the rules in the Abu Dhabi decider. Ad The cost cap saga has layered another layer of intrigue to that with Red Bull found guilty of committing a minor breach of the F1 budget cap last season. Brazilian Grand Prix Verstappen a boss but still weak technically says exRed Bull chief 5 HOURS AGO Red Bull have received criticism from teams  drivers and pundits alike with Hamilton being one of those. What I can say is I remember last year at Silverstone we had our last upgrade said the Mercedes driver at last months Japanese GP . But then we would see Red Bull every weekend or every other weekend bringing upgrades. They had I think at least four more upgrades from that point. If we spent 300000 on a new floor or adapted a wing it would have changed the outcome of the championship naturally because we would have been in better competition in the next race if you add it on. Marko has responded to those claims with his own take on the situation scoffing at Hamiltons suggestion. It was the first year of the budget cap he told Auto Motor Sport . The rules were vague. They Formula 1 reacted late with clarifications. We had auditors Ernst  Young check everything. You have to rely on something. We thought we had a safety net of 3million 2.6m. In the end there was only 400000 350000 left. With that money Hamilton constructs a front wing. Haas who also criticised Red Bull make a whole new car. This may not be the end of the cost cap saga with Marko warning of multiple teams having issues with this years limit. I think the current status is that six teams are over it he said. Inflation is something that was not calculable to that extent. Especially when it comes to energy costs. Away from the track Marko reflected on the death of Red Bull founder Dietrich Mateschitz and how he thinks his team will inevitably run differently from next year onwards. Certainly a lot will change. It was de facto autocracy Marko said. But Red Bull Racing is the groups strongest and most efficient marketing tool. We have worked very independently in the past. We were the only ones who didnt have to follow certain company rules. This autonomy existed with the consent of Mateschitz. But it has already leaked out that the new management wants to continue Formula 1 activities. Like now with a relatively strong independence. Marko who said 2022 would go down as Red Bulls best season ever due to the competition being much bigger and better believes Verstappens record of 14 race wins in a season  which may yet increase  will be hard to beat even with F1 adding more races next term. So so proud Verstappen reacts to breaking F1 season win record Marko said Its fair to say that there are a lot more races today. But after a few months everyone forgets what the base was. It will certainly not be easy to set this record again. And we mustnt forget There are still two races to go. Ahead of this weekends Brazilian GP Hamilton was made an honorary citizen of Brazil leading on from his lifetime admiration of Ayrton Senna.

F1 plays the role of a mediator in Red Bull and Sky Sports disagreement, https://sixsports.in/f1-plays-the-role-of-a-mediator-in-red-bull-and-sky-sports-disagreement/, Following their recent disagreement Red Bull and Sky will resume their media commitments at the Brazilian Grand Prix. Later it was revealed that no team member of Red Bull will be interacting with Sky Sports during the race weekend in any language. According to RacingNews365.com Formula 1 was involved in the discussions to find a solution to the Red Bull and Sky Sports dispute. Red Bulls protest was just partially successful because Sky Sports was still able to air F1s own interview material which included everyone from Red Bull. The issue of Red Bull refusing to interact with Sky is not unique new., Following their recent disagreement Red Bull and Sky will resume their media commitments at the Brazilian Grand Prix. The Red Bull drivers were reportedly avoiding Sky Sports over the Mexican Grand Prix weekend because they were upset about the broadcasters unfair bias while addressing the 2021 season finale and the cost cap controversy. Max Verstappen was especially unhappy with Skys Formula 1 coverage and stated that he was facing constant disrespect he has got this year and insisted that he was done with it. The backlash is said to be partially due to remarks made by Ted Kravitz of Sky Sports who said that Lewis Hamilton had been robbed of the championship in 2021. Later it was revealed that no team member of Red Bull will be interacting with Sky Sports during the race weekend in any language. According to RacingNews365.com Formula 1 was involved in the discussions to find a solution to the Red Bull and Sky Sports dispute. According to Daily Mail reports Billy McGinty the CEO of Sky Sports is visiting Red Bull in Milton Keynes today Monday in an effort to ease tensions between the two companies. Boycott ends in Brazil After the Mexican Grand Prix Red Bull team boss Christian Horner confirmed that the boycott would only apply at one race and that service will be resumed at the race week in Brazil. It is unknown till how far normal service will be back or whether Red Bull will pick and select the reporters and broadcasters they interact with. Red Bulls protest was just partially successful because Sky Sports was still able to air F1s own interview material which included everyone from Red Bull. The issue of Red Bull refusing to interact with Sky is not unique new. While Ferrari had similar limitations with Sky Italy Haas had previously declined to communicate with Sky Germany.

TECH TUESDAY: The very different Red Bull Ferrari and Mercedes solutions to one of F1’s key performance areas, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.tech-tuesday-the-very-different-red-bull-ferrari-and-mercedes-solutions-to.4g7wKT5yJCzEwqJtXfDkCN.html, In assessing the respective performance patterns of the Red Bull Ferrari and Mercedes this season a lot of attention has been focused on their differing aerodynamic traits and how these are better or worse suited to each track layout. Those at the front because their task is more complex than those at the rear tend to be of a more intricate design  and this is where we see a big variation between the Red Bull Ferrari and Mercedes. Furthermore the complexity of demands for the ducts has increased this year because of the regulation stipulation of a standardised wheel rim. As a rule of thumb every 10deg C of rim temperature increases tyre temperature by around 1deg C.Inside their drum Ferrari run without shrouding around the disc unlike Red Bull or Mercedes. The downside however is that the rim temperature can continue to increase during a race stint thereby overheating the tyres., In assessing the respective performance patterns of the Red Bull Ferrari and Mercedes this season a lot of attention has been focused on their differing aerodynamic traits and how these are better or worse suited to each track layout. But relatively little has been discussed about a performance factor thats at least as significant how each of the RB18 F175 and W13 uses its tyres. There are myriad factors feeding into tyre behaviour  notably weight distribution suspension geometry tyre pressures and brake bias  but perhaps the most crucial of all is how the brakes are used to indirectly control the tyre temperature via the wheel rims. It is an incredibly complex subject. READ MORE How does the F1 Sprint work The format explained ahead of its return this weekend in Brazil The tyres optimum temperature depending upon compound is between 100150 degrees C. The carbon brake discs around six inches away run at between 5001000deg C. The requirement is to keep the tyres within their quite narrow operating temperature window which is trickier to do with the undriven front tyres than the driven rears. The focus with cooling of the rear tyres is simply to divert the brake heat out and away from the wheel rim but at the front sometimes it is advantageous to transfer more of that heat into the tyres in order that they come up to temperature in time for a qualifying lap a race start or restart. Brake ducts are used to channel the air as required. Those at the front because their task is more complex than those at the rear tend to be of a more intricate design  and this is where we see a big variation between the Red Bull Ferrari and Mercedes. Red Bulls full brake assembly after a fairing redesign part of which was the removal of a thermal covering. Furthermore the complexity of demands for the ducts has increased this year because of the regulation stipulation of a standardised wheel rim. Previously teams designed their own rims with differing patterns of indentations on their inner surface to give different surface areas and therefore different rates of heat absorption according to the demands of the track and the car itself. Also new in the 2022 regulations is the requirement to exit the brake cooling air through a single rearwardsfacing outlet rather than out through the wheel spokes where it would previously help accelerate the outwashed airflow coming around the front tyres. READ MORE Theres no limit to what we can do  Hamilton on fighting back best friend Wolff and changing the world The channels within the ducts apportion how much of the incoming air goes directly to the brake disc to keep it below the critical threshold at which the carbon would oxydise. There will be another channel directing the air to the brake caliper. Both flows then exit through the same rearwardsfacing outlet. Encasing these channels is a big carbon fibre drum which is there solely to contain the heat within the brake area preventing too much of it seeping through the metal wheel rim and into the tyres. As a rule of thumb every 10deg C of rim temperature increases tyre temperature by around 1deg C. Inside their drum Ferrari run without shrouding around the disc unlike Red Bull or Mercedes. Ferraris solution to this complex set of demands appears simpler than that used by Red Bull and Mercedes in that they have left the brake disc exposed within the big drum. On the other two cars there are fairings within the area inside the drum which can be varied to apportion different flows to the disc caliper and directly to the outlet. From the respective performance patterns of the cars this season it would seem that Ferraris system puts more heat into the rims and tyres in that it almost never struggles for instant first lap front tyre performance  and the other two often do. This could well be an important part of Ferraris superstrong qualifying performances this season. The downside however is that the rim temperature can continue to increase during a race stint thereby overheating the tyres. READ MORE I always believed in the project  Max Verstappen on Red Bull his second title and how long he plans to race in F1 We saw this trait as recently as Japan where Charles Leclerc managed to hold onto Max Verstappens Red Bull for three laps both lapping two seconds faster than the rest of the field before the Ferraris front tyres then began to overheat allowing Verstappen to pull easily away and Sergio Perezs Red Bull to catch up to the Ferrari by the end. The phenomenon was also a factor in Verstappens defeat of Ferrari in the Imola Sprint race Miami and Hungary.

Hamilton explains how he came up with his signature "hammer time" radio call � RaceFans, https://www.racefans.net/2022/11/08/hamilton-explains-how-he-came-up-with-his-signature-hammer-time-radio-call/, Lewis Hamilton has explained how his teams signature hammer time radio message originally came about through an exchange with his race engineer Peter Bonnington. But the hammer time call was heard once again at the recent United States Grand Prix as Hamilton pursued eventual race winner Max Verstappen. Hamilton recalled how he came up with the idea to use it as Bonningtons signal for Hamilton to push to the maximum. Lambiase Max just mind that single bump on the run down to turn 12 try to stay right. Bonnington Lewis its Hammer time Bonnington Box., Lewis Hamilton has explained how his teams signature hammer time radio message originally came about through an exchange with his race engineer Peter Bonnington. Bonnington  Bono  has been Hamiltons race engineer since the driver joined Mercedes in 2013. During his titlewinning 2014 campaign Bonningtons use of the phrase hammer time as an instruction for Hamilton to be on full attack became a regular feature of their radio chatter. It remained a frequently heard radio message in the subsequent years as Hamilton continued to win races and titles. But it has been heard less frequently during 2022 as Mercedes slump in form left them out of contention for victories for much of the year. But the hammer time call was heard once again at the recent United States Grand Prix as Hamilton pursued eventual race winner Max Verstappen. The expression comes from MC Hammers 1990 hiphop track U Cant Touch This. Hamilton recalled how he came up with the idea to use it as Bonningtons signal for Hamilton to push to the maximum. I think I came up with hammer time he said. Because there was a point where he was like now its time to push. And I got frustrated with him because Im like dude Im already pushing. But I was like if youre trying to signify that nows the time to go allout use everything you have I said just tell me its hammer time. Since they teams up at Mercedes together Hamilton and Bonnington have delivered a total of six world championship titles. Advert  Become a RaceFans supporter and go adfree Im incredibly grateful for Bono said Hamilton. Ive had an amazing journey with him. I think weve got one of the longest if not longest standing driverengineer partnerships that theres been and hes been hugely integral to my success. Weve had an amazing journey together weve supported each other on and off track through good and bad times. Hamilton describes Bonnington as one of few people whos able to put up with him along with his pet dog Roscoe. I love working with Bono hes like a brother to me  a brother from another mother. I think hes probably one of the few people that can truly stand me I would say on the good and bad days except for Roscoe. What he is able to do how calm he is able to be throughout the race and how hes able to help guide and help me navigate through a race I dont think theres many people that could do that. Their partnership will continue into an 11th season next year and Hamilton plans to be on the Formula 1 grid longer than that.

Latifi would only consider F1 reserve role if it offered path back to a seat, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/latifi-would-only-consider-f1-reserve-role-if-it-offered-path-back-to-a-seat/10396612/, 2023 is set to be the first year since 2018 that Latifi has not enjoyed some kind of involvement with an F1 team. Speaking on F1s Beyond the Grid podcast Latifi said that if he were to consider a reserve role in F1 it would need to have a realistic pathway back to a race seat  something he did not currently think was possible. Me personally just to be a reserve driver without any clear path of making a return its not something I would want to do because being a reserve driver is not what I see as my longterm career. If I was to do IndyCar I would want to do the ovals said Latifi. I think theres only four races now where theres ovals but I definitely want to do all the races., Listen to this article Latifi has two races remaining with Williams before ending his threeyear stint at the team after announcing their split back in September. The Canadian driver has always maintained that he is open to a number of possible racing options next year but has been strongly linked with a potential switch to IndyCar. 2023 is set to be the first year since 2018 that Latifi has not enjoyed some kind of involvement with an F1 team. He previously worked with Force India in 2018 as a test driver before linking up with Williams in a development role for 2019 prior to his F1 graduation with the team the following year. Speaking on F1s Beyond the Grid podcast Latifi said that if he were to consider a reserve role in F1 it would need to have a realistic pathway back to a race seat  something he did not currently think was possible. I think the only way I would consider a third driver role is if I saw a realistic way to return to the grid in Formula 1 which speaking honestly and bluntly I dont see to be the case said Latifi. Obviously Alex Albon did that last year so it shows its possible. I think he was in a different situation with Red Bull. Me personally just to be a reserve driver without any clear path of making a return its not something I would want to do because being a reserve driver is not what I see as my longterm career. Nicholas Latifi Williams FW44 Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images At the same time if I cant find something thats suitable for me next year whether that means taking a year off to potentially put together something better for the following year all the options are still open. Latifi is in talks with teams in a number of categories about a potential race programme for next year but he acknowledged that moving into IndyCar was the most obvious route to take. He said the American singleseater series was the one he enjoyed watching the most outside of F1 believing it offered very exciting close racing. Were Latifi to make the switch to IndyCar he confirmed that he would look to do a full programme that included racing on ovals despite noting the added risks involved. If I was to do IndyCar I would want to do the ovals said Latifi. I wouldnt want to take myself out of potential championship points. Especially if I was to do it for multiple years if I didnt do ovals the first year then the second year doing them I would still be having to learn and get on top of it. By then youre arguably in a position more to fight for podiums and wins and championships and youre still at a disadvantage for quite a few races. I did have the opinion at one point that they are very dangerous and unsafe. In recent years less so but its definitely something I would want to do. I think theres only four races now where theres ovals but I definitely want to do all the races.
Domenicali: Formula 1's exposure to global recession 'reduced', https://f1i.com/news/459643-domenicali-formula-1s-exposure-to-global-recession-reduced.html, F1 boss Stefano Domenicali says the sport isnt immune against an economic downturn but longterm contracts as well as Grand Prix racings international presence protect it against the risks of a global recession. Therefore the question of a global recession is no longer if but when. Addressing the impact of an economic slowdown on Formula 1 Domenicali acknowledged that the sport is closely monitoring the current downturn. Formula 1s most recent numbers reflected the sports continued growth spurred on by its rising popularity which teams and promoters continue to embrace. The attendance increase is just magnificent in terms of what Formula 1 is bringing mainly to new audiences he said., F1 boss Stefano Domenicali says the sport isnt immune against an economic downturn but longterm contracts as well as Grand Prix racings international presence protect it against the risks of a global recession. With inflation still trending higher and energy prices showing no sign of significantly declining warning signs continue to flash across world markets. Therefore the question of a global recession is no longer if but when. Addressing the impact of an economic slowdown on Formula 1 Domenicali acknowledged that the sport is closely monitoring the current downturn. But the Italian also struck a reassuring tone. First of all being a world championship we can spread around the world the risk of having this kind of situation to manage Domenicali told Wall Street analysts last week during The Formula One Groups third quarter conference call. On the other hand the fact that we have longterm agreements will reduce the exposure to this risk. What I can say and share with you is that we already see an incredible number of preregistration with regards to the ticketing of next year. So this is a good sign. In Europe where Im living it is clear that this recession is taking place. But I think that the way that we are structured the way that we have done the deals will protect us and will enable us to move forward in this direction. Therefore I would say this kind of situation lets us think that we should be optimistic in this context that of course we monitor. But this is what we see today. Formula 1s most recent numbers reflected the sports continued growth spurred on by its rising popularity which teams and promoters continue to embrace. The attendance increase is just magnificent in terms of what Formula 1 is bringing mainly to new audiences he said. And that is true that the business model we are having with certain promoters is more related to the fact that there is a fee that they have to pay there is the highend Paddock Club that is on our side. And theres  not a challenge  but the big opportunity to move forward is how we can maximise the revenue and monetise the revenue that we can take from the fact that Formula 1 has become more and more attractive. Thats really what were going to do in the future. We have a different way to do it and Im sure that were going to capitalise this growth in the best way that we can in the next couple of years.

Max Verstappen 'weak technically' Sebastian Vettel 'more complete' when arriving in F1 says Red Bull head, https://www.eurosport.com/formula-1/brazilian-grand-prix/2019/max-verstappen-weak-technically-sebastian-vettel-more-complete-when-arriving-in-f1-says-red-bull-hea_sto9218399/story.shtml, Max Verstappen was less of a complete driver than Sebastian Vettel when arriving in F1 according to Guillaume Rocquelin Red Bulls exhead of race engineering. He asked a lot of questions took a lot of notes and when he arrived with us he was very thorough. I think Max maybe had more natural talent thats what he relied on the most. But Ill be honest Max is weak technically compared to other drivers weve worked with. But Rocquelin now head of Red Bulls driver academy said the Dutchmans arrival truly came back in 2016 when he won his first race aged just 18., Max Verstappen was less of a complete driver than Sebastian Vettel when arriving in F1 according to Guillaume Rocquelin Red Bulls exhead of race engineering. In a frank admission Rocquelin also said that Verstappen who wrapped up his second world title recently  compares unfavourably on a technical level to other drivers that have passed through the Red Bull stable and still has a lot of progress to make. Ad That said Rocquelin  who held his head of race engineering role between 2015 and 2022  lauded Verstappen for being a boss and maturing this year to dominate the rest of the F1 field winning a record 14 races with two still left to go. Brazilian Grand Prix Red Bulls Marko aims dig at Hamilton over cost breach comments 4 HOURS AGO In discussion with Eurosport Frances Les Fous du Volant podcast  Rocquelin said I think Sebastian was a more complete driver than Max when he arrived with us. At the professional level technique mediation...he was trained at the Michael Schumacher school who was his idol. He asked a lot of questions took a lot of notes and when he arrived with us he was very thorough. It is no coincidence that he won several titles. He was more prepared technically mentally. I think Max maybe had more natural talent thats what he relied on the most. But Sebastian was the most complete. Max has always been a boss. He has enormous selfconfidence he knows what he wants and he is very direct. But Ill be honest Max is weak technically compared to other drivers weve worked with. I think he still has a lot of progress to make. He is a leader by his attitude his results. But I think he can improve from a technical point of view and in the way of developing the car. Rocquelin expanded on how he felt Verstappen had grown in 2022. What struck me the most was that he has somewhat lost this desperate hunger that he had last year Rocquelin said. He has matured. He has gained consistency. Winning the championship has given him a lot of confidence and he drives in a different way. We cant necessarily speak of a single trigger. It is something progressive there were several stages. He started F1 very young with great ambition and perhaps not the maturity that went with it. He also started with Toro Rosso who perhaps had less stature and experience. Then the stages began when he arrived at Red Bull. There was more confidence in the team a good record he was closer to his goal. He won a race immediately with us which allowed him to take a step forward. Gradually he won more races and developed links with his engineers. Verstappen seeking to continue his form at this weekends Brazilian GP looks like establishing an era of dominance in F1 provided his Red Bull team can stay ahead of the others in the engineering stakes. But Rocquelin now head of Red Bulls driver academy said the Dutchmans arrival truly came back in 2016 when he won his first race aged just 18. Hes always had talent Rocquelin said. To say that we are starting an era because he is starting to win titles is not necessarily correct. It started when he won his first race with us. Then there is also the quality of the car we hope to continue to win titles. Its up to us to make a car that matches its talent.

According to Stuck who is also a steward for Formula E Formula 1 is excessively reliant on rules currently and believes that drivers are also to be blamed for this scrutiny. Stuck said on ServusTV What I dont understand is that today different drivers are chasing other drivers when they exceed track limits. I wont name names but it can happen to anyone. Then dont immediately go yes but him this yes but him that Thats very annoying Stuck The punishment culture should stop. The German believes that there is an excessive culture of punishment by the stewards for track limit breaches and urges them to avoid imposing time penalties too frequently. Stuck added Just let them accelerate. In Mexico penalties of five and 10 seconds are also handed out again. They are racing incidents we can do without those kinds of penalties. Stuck continued to say he thinks some drivers are considered to be too nice to each other. They dont have to drink coffee together do they They are going to compete with each other so let that fight be a fight too. Track limits have been in the headlines quite frequently this season.

Hes won the most grands prix in a year now within 22 races. On top of that hes won two sprint races and hes not won all of them from pole position. Its incredible the level of consistency that hes been able to achieve.Red Bull celebrates Max Verstappens second world title in Japan. But I think Max what were seeing today and this year were actually witnessing something very special., As well as securing his second F1 drivers crown in 2022 Verstappen has with 14 grand prix wins taken the world record for the most victories in a campaign. And while domination by a single team is quite common in grand prix racing Horner reckons that the nature of Verstappens charge stands out this year. Asked if he felt 2022 was the most dominant campaign he has seen from a single driver Horner said Theres been years of domination with Mercedes but I think as an individual driver probably yes. Hes won the most grands prix in a year now within 22 races. On top of that hes won two sprint races and hes not won all of them from pole position. Hes had to fight and race for a lot of those victories. I think when we look back at the end of the year it is an absolutely outstanding year that Max has driven. He hasnt put a wheel wrong. Hes been perfect throughout the season. Its incredible the level of consistency that hes been able to achieve. Red Bull celebrates Max Verstappens second world title in Japan. Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images With Red Bull having won the constructors championship its title double is the first since the glory years it enjoyed with Sebastian Vettel from 2010 to 2013. Comparing his two world champion drivers Horner reckons Verstappen is not given the praise he deserves considering just how well he is performing right now. They are two very different drivers two phenomenally successful drivers he said. I think that what Sebastian has achieved in his career puts him amongst the greats and the most successful drivers in the sport. But I think Max what were seeing today and this year were actually witnessing something very special. I actually think his achievements sometimes dont receive the plaudits that they should because I think actually what weve witnessed this year is an absolutely outstanding performance from a driver that is very much at the top of his game. Horner also believes that Red Bull deserves some credit for having helped produce the cars and performance to have allowed drivers like Verstappen and Vettel to shine. Theres a lot of people sitting around the engineering office and the garage and back at the factory that are all the same people that did that with Sebastian  and theyre doing it again with Max he said. I think the DNA of our team is that were a race team. Were a team of racers we push the boundaries. Were aggressive in the way that we go racing and we follow our passion which is to go out there and do our very very best. We are following Dietrichs Mateschitz mantra of no risk no fun.
Bottas exclusive: "I was so so hard on myself...", https://www.racefans.net/2022/11/08/i-was-so-hard-on-myself-it-was-difficult-to-deal-with-bottas-speaks-to-racefans/, He isnt sporting one when RaceFans meets up with the Alfa Romeo driver in the Mexico City paddock but he is visible relaxed. Especially the first couple of years  I was so so hard on myself Bottas admits candidly. Advert  Become a RaceFans supporter and go adfreeYes and no Bottas replies. But also it is because of the team environment why I feel less pressure.Bottas hit the ground running after joining Alfa Romeo. With a multiyear contract he says hes focusing on the longterm with Alfa Romeo., To say that fans have seen a new side of Valtteri Bottas since his departure from Mercedes to join Alfa Romeo for the 2022 season would be putting it lightly. In the thick of the fight at the front at Mercedes over five seasons Bottas was often quick sometimes stunningly so but always under intense scrutiny and pressure  as much from himself as anyone else. But while his move from Brackley to Hinwil in Switzerland has inevitably brought a slip down the grid the 10times grand prix winner seems to have embraced his escape from the pressurecooker environment at the front of the field. Where he may have only shown flashes of his cheekier side at Mercedes through the occasional TikTok since joining Alfa Romeo hes been quite literally flashing his cheeks every chance he gets  from auctioning off prints of him swimming nude in a Colarado river to sharing videos of him naked in a Finnish sauna. Earlier in the season in France  to spark a new fashion trend by offering him one of the Circuit Paul Ricard bucket hats offered to journalists. After barely leaving the crown of his head for the rest of the weekend you can now buy an official Valtteri Bottas bucket hat of your own should you be so inclined. He isnt sporting one when RaceFans meets up with the Alfa Romeo driver in the Mexico City paddock but he is visible relaxed. Clearly content in his new surroundings less than a year on from being let go by a Mercedes team who had grown deeply fond of him as evidenced by the warm farewell he received at the factory at the end of last year. But by Bottass own admission he now looks back on his time with Mercedes and realises just how mentally taxing it was for him to be racing for the world champion team. Especially the first couple of years  I was so so hard on myself Bottas admits candidly. I wanted everything now and then it was difficult to deal with it when it didnt happen that I couldnt win the title in the first couple of years. It was just hard to accept. I was really harsh on myself and definitely sometimes being a bit more chilled would have helped. Now Bottas is a different man and a different driver. Heading towards the end of his first year with his new team and having gone from being in the mix for poles and wins to scrapping to get inside the top ten is he approaching race weekends in 2022 with a different mindset much like he is taking to his life off the track Advert  Become a RaceFans supporter and go adfree Yes and no Bottas replies. Obviously it is different that were not fighting for wins realistically at the moment or world championship titles. So that is a different feeling in a way that I feel personally a little bit less pressure in that. But also it is because of the team environment why I feel less pressure. Bottas hit the ground running after joining Alfa Romeo. He scored 40 points over the first seven rounds to springboard his new team up to fifth place in the constructors championship. It was an impressive early showing by the team which ended last year secondtolast. But points have come few and far between since then as Bottas and his team found themselves swallowed up by the rapid rate of development their rivals enjoyed as the season progressed. Now Alfa Romeo are under siege in sixth. Going into the Mexico weekend they lie just three points ahead of Aston Martin who have had the total opposite form over the season. But having been at the top Bottas knows how the game works. With a multiyear contract he says hes focusing on the longterm with Alfa Romeo. Every year in my career Ive always wanted to do as well as I can he explains. Trying to have the perfect race weekend and be the best version of myself  that never changes. But now at the same time its also accepting the fact that were aiming for the years ahead and accepting the fact that nothing happens overnight. The team cant jump from P9 or P8 to P2 or P1  it doesnt happen like that. So we accept the fact that it can take time. So all the development work for sure is for this year but its also for the future and giving ourselves almost a little bit of time to change things and I think its good. Not long after Sebastian Vettel moved from Ferrari to Aston Martin the former champion admitted that returning to the midfield had given him a new appreciation for what life is like for teams outside of the fight at the front. However after starting his career with Williams for four seasons before his big Mercedes break Bottas says hes well aware of how much effort his new team and those around him put into everything they do. Every team Ive been at they work so so hard Bottas says. Its such a competitive sport that everyone just wants to get better and better. Theres always that mindset with anything you do. I feel like a championshipwinning team or a team fighting for P9 they work as hard as anyone else. So I think yeah I havent seen a difference in that. Advert  Become a RaceFans supporter and go adfree Bottas has every incentive to want to stick around in Switzerland. With Alfa Romeo ceasing their partnership with the Sauber organisation who operate the team at the end of next season the evolution into Audis factory team for the new power unit formula in 2026 will begin. Bottas says that the German marques decision to take its very first steps into Formula 1 by teaming with Sauber is no less than huge for the team. I think it shows that they believe they can do a successful project with Sauber. It shows that we definitely have the facilities and the potential  which Ive always been saying when Ive seen everything. So its good  it is huge for the team. Still we need to wait for a few more years. But it is great. I couldnt be happier for that. But with the Audi evolution still a way off on the horizon Bottas says he is not getting ahead of himself. For now Sauber are Alfa Romeo and he must help lead the team as they are now. Obviously there still is quite a few years for that to happen and still nothing changes for next year he states. My focus is on finishing this year and doing good next year and hopefully well have a good car. I think its a positive thing for the team. I think its a great opportunity and I think it shows that they respect what Sauber has in terms of facilities and people and stuff. So I think the future of this team is quite exciting. Bottas may not be climbing on top of the Formula 1 podium this season but he certainly hasnt stopped winning races. Inspired by his partner professional road cycle racer Tiffany Cromwell Bottas has become a bona fide bicycling fanatic entering twowheeled races of his own and even taking a victory in his age class in a 60kilometre offroad bike race in Kansas before the United States Grand Prix. Following Bottas on social media youd be forgiven for assuming he was a cyclist whose hobby is racing Formula 1 not the other way around. So has investing his energy into this very different form of racing helped with maintaining good mental health over a gruelling F1 calendar Advert  Become a RaceFans supporter and go adfree For me personally yes. Its a nice way to get away and do something different. I think its important with such a hectic calendar. The race weeks are normally pretty intense especially from Wednesday onwards. But when I have some free time its something that I really enjoy doing. Its a way for me to clear my mind and explore and get fit so its nice. As the conversation continues in the Alfa Romeo hospitality suite theres a sudden interruption. Its none other than Zhou Guanyu Bottass team mate offering up a plate of sweets  chilli and watermelon flavoured to be precise. Bottas politely declines his team mates offer but it shows the genuine friendship thats formed between the rookie and the veteran over their year together. Alfa Romeos driver lineup may have changed completely in 2022 but the harmony within it has been a constant. Last year Kimi Raikkonen and Antonio Giovinazzi left the team as firm friends after three seasons together. So is there something about the team culture at Alfa Romeo that leads to harmony between team mates in a sport where both drivers in the same team can become the fiercest rivals or Bottas and Zhou just have compatible personalities I think its both says Bottas. Im sure you need certain drivers to be able to work together and you need a certain type of characters to match in a way. But as a team its a pretty friendly environment in a way and just really a good team spirit. It would be nice to know why that is but for me I was just immediately comfortable coming here. And same for my teammate. Even though its his first year hes been immediately really comfortable with everyone and gained a lot of confidence quickly on so thats good. With his tenth season in Formula 1 almost at its end the Bottas of 2022 is far from the freshfaced 23yearold who first lined up on the Melbourne grid back in 2013. Now aged 33 theres still plenty of time left for Bottas to continue in the sport as long as he has the drive and the results to back it up. But while what will come in the future is unknown he can at least look back and recognise how far hes come. Definitely the older you get the more you experience things I think you learn more about yourself he explains. I think this sport is a pretty good life school. Its a pretty highpressure environment overall. When you are a person that wants to succeed and wants to do your best theres always ups and downs and you learn so much about yourself like how to deal with the pressure and how to deal with disappointments. How to actually enjoy the success  those kinds of things. Every year is different in this sport and you always learn something more so. Nowadays I look back to myself five to eight years ago I have so much bigger picture of this whole thing and accepting of many things and Im so much more comfortable within myself. Its been a nice school. Advert  Become a RaceFans supporter and go adfree Become a RaceFans Supporter RaceFans is run thanks in part to the generous support of its readers.

A Sustainable Business: Q&A With Formula 1 CEO Stefano Domenicali, https://www.gfmag.com/topics/news/stefano-domenicali-interview, Global Finance speaks to Stefano Domenicali president and CEO of Formula 1 about the current economic climate and what sustainability means to the company. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Formula 1 CEO Stefano Domenicali. Formula 1 the LibertyMedia autoracing subsidiary is much changed since Stefano Domenicali took over as president and CEO just two years ago. Domenicali was the CEO of Lamborghini from 2016 to 2020 and before that was team principal for Ferrari in F1. But so far the economic crisis is something related to many external factors that are not inside our sport business., Global Finance speaks to Stefano Domenicali president and CEO of Formula 1 about the current economic climate and what sustainability means to the company. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Formula 1 CEO Stefano Domenicali. Formula 1 the LibertyMedia autoracing subsidiary is much changed since Stefano Domenicali took over as president and CEO just two years ago. The number of races has increased and the number of teams is about to do the same and priorities seem to have changed with sustainability a new byword. The company aims to reach netzero carbon emissions by 2030not just for the cars but across all its operations and events. It is discussing with fuel companies development of 100 sustainable energy as the sole source for all its cars by 2025 ultimately to be marketed to a wider public. Renewable electricity sourcing is also goal for its factories facilities and venues. The company is also seeking to improve diversity throughout the organizazion and particularly among drivers. F1 is working on a allwomen championship series to tackle the lack of female drivers. No woman has qualified to compete in an F1 race since 1980. The target according to several reports will be younger women from 16 to 22 years old. F1 is sponsoring education programs to encourage the study of STEM subjects. One of the goals is to increase the diversity of participation at all levels of the organization. The company is further expanding its market reach via its recent program about Formula 1 on Netflix. Add to that the launch of spending caps for the racing teams a controversial move to level the playing field of the F1 participants by putting the emphasis on each teams ingenuity rather than the depth of their pockets. He believes F1 could be a sustainability model for the automotive industry and others with his goal of net zero carbon by 2030 and a sustainable fuel by 2025. Domenicali was the CEO of Lamborghini from 2016 to 2020 and before that was team principal for Ferrari in F1. As the head of a global and fastgrowing organizationone of the largest in the sports worldhe deals with sustainability issues supply chain concerns and diversity goals. Based in London but always on the road for the races and new business he spoke to Global Finance during a recent visit to New York. Last year the F1 group reported an revenue increase of 87 to 2 billion and managed to return to an operating profit of 40 million after a loss of 444 million the previous year. All this for a company now traded on Nasdaq and with a market cap of nearly 13 billion. Global Finance What has the pandemic meant for F1 and for you Stefano Domenicali If you talk about Covid19 Ive learned a lot of things living in London and trying to react to Covid19 and create opportunities. We didnt panic but we reacted. Actually we were a benchmark for other sports internationally. We showed a system of being organized with bubbles to keep people separate with masks with vaccination. Even today the people that are working for us have to be vaccinated. In London as you know Covid19 has been taken totally different. Since the end of last year there was no mask requirement full campaign or vaccination going ahead in the UK and we were going to other places where the mask is still alive but with PCR testing. Today there are certain countries where there is still a Covid19 issuetake the example of Chinaand where we dont know exactly where we stand. A few weeks ago I was in Singapore to overview a possible investment there and they still require a PCR test. GF You are having more races in the USnow three per year rather than onebut where is growth for Formula 1 in general Domenicali I think that growth is and will be related to our different approach. First of all we were a very superexclusive and I would say notapproachable sport. We moved to being a very inclusive sport. Changing our communication plan being active on social media trying to maximize the visibility of our protagonistsdrivers and teamsto a dimension that was not there before. Having the possibility also to grow with narratives and with content like our successful show on Netflix just renewed for a fifth season represents a dimension that was not really present before. GF Tell us about your sustainability efforts. Domenicali We made some important changes with regard to the sustainability of sport. Working on new regulations to have more competitive racing and working on the financial stability of the system working on the budget cap for each team allowing the team to be sustainable from the business point of view and and allowing them to really I would say brutally make money on what is their business to develop. The third element is to keep the dimension of F1 international and try to maximize the commercial opportunities that we saw and growing step by step around the world. In an average year we used to have a calendar of 17 races and now were moving towards 2324 races. I think that is showing the interest that we have generated as a sport. Therefore I would say these are the most important elements. And I see in this context you know a great relationship with our stakeholders and with our partners. Because this has attracted new sponsors New Grand Prix that wants to have Formula 1. And I would say that the positivity around us is also related to our sustainable plan for the future with regard to carbon neutrality by 2030 that has enabled us to be credible to investors. All these elements have taken this sport in a very healthy space. GF Is there a risk that every country and every team would do something different in their races And has there been there a reaction to new regulations Domenicali No from a general point of view I would say what weve seen is that there is a very big alignment on what we are doing. If we take sustainability and the fact that we were by the way the first sport to have the most efficient engines since 2014 hybrid ones and that we have already decided to go fully sustainable fuel and hybrid from 2026 we saw that as a big opportunity for the automotive sector to be much more effective in a world where there is a big push to be fully electric. We do believe that there are other possibilities to achieve the ambitious targets that the politicians have given to the industry. On sustainable fuels Formula 1 will accelerate because this is our DNA and will accelerate the usage of these sustainable fuels. For commercial vehicles that will never go electric for planes that will never go electric for ships that will never go electric. We will accelerate the development of this kind of fuel which will help to the mission to grow to zero carbon in the future. GF Is there anyone holding you back within the industry Domenicali No. Everyone sees as an opportunity now. And this is great. Thats why we also have the interest for new automotive manufacturers to come into F1. We have a big push on all the promoters that to use sustainable or biofuel when they have to generate the electricity to run the big shows that we are organizing. We have sometimes 400000 spectators in the same place. We need to make sure that everything is done in the proper way. GF Sustainability is your number one priority Domenicali Yes. Because at the end of the day todayand I tell you from my private experienceif you dont have something to present in that landscape that is serious no one wants to talk with you businesswise. If we are not credible in that landscape no one is with you. Today we have so many partners commercial partners working with us or with the teams like never before. It means that what we are presenting is something that they embrace as a project. GF We are discussing the climate. But these days we also have high inflation higher rates. How does it affect Formula 1 Domenicali I think this is also the opportunity to say from the cost perspective this is a challenge and the teams have reacted to the budget cap. The top teams two years agonot 30were spending more than the double what they can spend now. So its just a way for the teams to react and to adjust that this will be an opportunity for the teams to be much more efficient. GF And the global economic situation Domenicali The fact that is from day to night the cost of transports moved up three times even four times for the international flights. And we take care of moving all the freights. As you know transportation has completely changed and so has the energy situation and these are things that are affecting the business from the cost perspective. But because there is a limit on what you can spend this is pushing the system to react and try to minimize this negative effect on the car structure. So we take these changes as an opportunity to improve the business. GF And in terms of supply chain Domenicali The supply chain has been for sure an issue. But also in that respect I would say the team of Formula 1 has has developed a very integrated supply chain where basically a lot of the most critical components and parts are done in house or prepared with a very solid supply chain relationship with different suppliers. As a result we havent so far suffered like other industries of this crisis. GF In your last conference call after the results of the third quarter the analysts asked if OEM Original Equipment Manufacturers will be eventually coming into F1. Domenicali I would say theyre coming in. We welcomed that the entry of Audi that has already informed us that is coming in. There are ongoing discussions with other OEM that are interested to see our plans for the future. So that means that the good vibes that we are living today is really spreading out with different companies which before were not really involved in our business. GF Formula 1 is currently listed on Nasdaq and has Liberty Media as a controlling shareholder what has it changed for F1 Domenicali From my perspective first of all I need to be very grateful to Liberty Media for the way they manage the business because they let us be very focused on the operation of the business and creating value for that business. Today I can see Liberty Media is totally focused on our business and this is a great great opportunity for us to keep working and pushing for the best of the sport itself. And I really love the challenge. GF Is there anything keeps you up at night What are you concerned about Domenicali Thank God I sleep at night because I have very intense days and I need to recover. But I think that life is made by cycles and we are still in a very high side of the cycle. This is the moment when we need to think how we can be strong when the things will slow down. All the elements that I can see in front of us are very very positive. Covid19 has showed us that from day to night something critical can happen. The more solid we are in our fundamentals of the business the more we can react to things that can happen in the world. But so far the economic crisis is something related to many external factors that are not inside our sport business. For us the mitigating factor is that we are embracing the world. GF How much Formula 1 is still a sport and how much is an entertainment I know you will tell me that youre totally committed to the sports side of it but Im curious for your answer. Domenicali I will tell you that we are totally committed to keep the sport in the center of what we are doing. But we dont have to forget that we want to be the biggest sport platform of the world. Therefore you can have great racing but its not enough. You need to create a unique experience a unique event where you have music fun entertainment and action because this is the only way to keep the attraction for different categories of fans and not only the ones that focus on the sport. We are also growing in other parts of the world where the sport has still to be developed. This is happening because we are now becoming attractive because of lifestyle. We are in a sort of circle on which one element is feeding the other Sport is at the center but entertainment in general is what we are. GF Currently the vast bulk80of F1 revenue comes from contracts with the automotive groups and the sponsors correct Domenicali Yes. There is a big opportunity to develop new fonts of revenue related to how we can maximize the monetization of our events and new funds are coming into the business. We need to create other form of revenues and the possibility to grow in places where before there were no investments in our sport. Before it was a very traditional business model. We had the promoters revenues we had sponsored revenues we had media rights revenues. Now we are embracing a new category where all the things related to the attention to fans can be explored. So thats a big big business that we need to develop in the future. GF Is there an Italian component in Formula 1 and how relevant is it Domenicali I think that Italy is a central part of this sport. Because at the end of the day in terms of technology of passion of promoters of race tracks in term of competence. Italy is for sure at the center together with the UK. We have just celebrated the hundred anniversary of the Monza Grand Prix in Italy this year. History in itself is not enough. History is good foundation but to sink down into historical elements is not what we want. The competition is getting tighter the competition is getting bigger and Italy has to react in the best way because the elements of being the best are still there. And as an Italian man I would love to see that really with the right approach at all levels. GF Social diversity is also important in your current agenda. Domenicali Were going to do something special soon to make sure that the women in the sport can have some possibility and a chance to grow. Our duty is to take away the physical barriers that could be seen as detrimental for their growth. To make sure that we are credible we need to do the right things. On the other hand we are not only focused on drivers but we are focused on giving the chance also to women and unprivileged communities to be part of our world. For that we have projects in education. We are offering stages and the possibility to work with teams in order to create the interns that can be where they were not present before. For example when F1 is going to new countries we talk to the local community and try to see what we can do for them. And this is what we did for example in Miami. This is were going to do in the future everywhere around the world. GF From the managerial point of view what has been the biggest challenge in the last few years Covid19 Domenicali Yes but Covid19 not only as an external factor to manage. I came to work in an organization where my first contacts were done with live videos through computers because it was a home working situation. When you want to be effective and you need to know your people doing it through the video is not great. But as I said no crying just action.

From Ayrton Sennas first F1 victory on home soil in 1991 to Sebastian Vettels dramatic world championship win in 2012 the Brazilian Grand Prix often delivers the drama. This time around itll be a case of whether anyone can catch world champion Max Verstappen who claimed his 14th win of the campaign last time out in Mexico  a new record for the most wins ever recorded in a single F1 season. But its Ferrari who are historically most successful around the famous Interlagos track and Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz will be keen to add to their teams tally of nine wins there and help break the teams poor run of recent form in 2022. Dont rule out Lewis Hamilton either who loves this track and this country so much so that this week he officially received Brazilian citizenship at a ceremony in the countrys capital Brasilia.

McLaren issues Massa warning over mechanical flag leniency, https://the-race.com/formula-1/mclaren-issues-massa-warning-over-mechanical-flag-leniency/, McLaren F1 team boss Seidl was asked to comment following a controversy that raged back and forth during the recent United States and Mexican Grands Prix. F1s stewards originally ruled in favour of Haas and declared the Alpine unsafe before Alpine overturned this ruling in Mexico following a review. In the same race Sergio Perez escaped a mechanical flag despite running with a broken front wing endplate which then fell off the car. Massa suffered lifethreatening injuries when an errant spring detached from Rubens Barrichellos Brawn during qualifying for the 2009 Hungarian GP. And we need to be aware something can happen anytime when such a part is falling off of a car., McLarens Andreas Seidl has reminded Formula 1 to consider Felipe Massas lifethreatening 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix accident when adopting a lenient approach to flagging down cars for running in a potentially dangerous condition. McLaren F1 team boss Seidl was asked to comment following a controversy that raged back and forth during the recent United States and Mexican Grands Prix. Having been on the receiving end of several black and orange mechanical meatball flags  shown to cars when they are considered unsafe and forcing them to pit for repairs  Haas protested Fernando Alonsos Alpine after the US GP for racing to the finish with a broken wing mirror. F1s stewards originally ruled in favour of Haas and declared the Alpine unsafe before Alpine overturned this ruling in Mexico following a review. But that review reinstated Alonso on a technicality  that the Haas protest wasnt lodged in time  not because the Alpine was actually considered safe after all. In fact the stewards stood by their original statement which said they were deeply concerned Alonsos car was allowed to race to the finish in Austin without pitting for repairs  and indeed his broken wing mirror flew off the car in the closing laps while he was racing Kevin Magnussens Haas. In the same race Sergio Perez escaped a mechanical flag despite running with a broken front wing endplate which then fell off the car. The inconsistency of the events of Austin compared to how Haas was treated earlier in the season left an important question hanging over the Mexico City paddock did the stewards original judgement in Austin mean F1 cars from now on would always be forced to pit for repairs for minor damage The stewards judgement suggested they would but Alpines Alan Permane revealed F1s teams had convinced the FIA to Uturn on this position saying small damages like a mirror like frontwing endplate if its nonstructural like a brake duct something like that will not be considered to be a black and orange flag offence. Mercedes Andrew Shovlin was in favour of showing leniency when using the black and orange flag saying weve survived a lot of years where they were used correctly and infrequently and we do need to just let the drivers get on with driving and not be too afraid of getting near another car. Massa suffered lifethreatening injuries when an errant spring detached from Rubens Barrichellos Brawn during qualifying for the 2009 Hungarian GP. Massa missed the rest of the season recovering from a fractured skull concussion and eye damage. A spring is obviously a much heavier and more dangerous component than a wing mirror but Seidls warning raises an important further question about where to draw the line in terms of safety when it comes to the structural integrity of F1 cars and their constituent parts. The failings exposed yet again in FIAs F1 penalty Uturn Read more Had a marshal or driver been struck and injured by Alonsos wing mirror or Perezs endplate there would certainly be no clamour for leniency to be show with mechanical flags. My view is that in general when you have parts on the car which are at risk to fly off the cars you get called in Seidl said. Because I havent forgotten what happened to Felipe Massa in Hungary. And we need to be aware something can happen anytime when such a part is falling off of a car. So I think thats our responsibility in that case to call the car in. I guess its just important now moving forward without any emotions have a good discussion between the teams and FIA and just put in place clear guidelines what we all want in the interest of safety. And take it away from any current emotions around opportunistic views of where everyone is in the championship or what happened in the past. But again safety always needs to come first. Dont forget what happened to Felipe Massa. This can happen anytime if a part like this is falling off and I just think it would be the wrong thing to actually be aware that something is loose and could fall off and just accept it and keep going. Seidls comments suggests there is no unanimous view among teams on this subject so further discussions will be needed with the FIA to decide where best to draw the line between allowing cars to race on and stopping them for repairs when they are damaged.

Indeed a number of FIA staff have also been targeted with harassment and hate posts over the past few years. It is totally unacceptable that our volunteers officials and employees are subjected to this extreme abuse. I will always stand up for my staff and volunteers. Passions run high in sport but online harassment abuse and hate speech must not be tolerated., Listen to this article Recently one of the FIA female stewards Silvia Bellot was the subject of death threats. It is utterly deplorable that a volunteer such as Silvia or any of our marshals and officials who volunteer their time to allow us to go racing is the subject of such hatred. Indeed a number of FIA staff have also been targeted with harassment and hate posts over the past few years. It is totally unacceptable that our volunteers officials and employees are subjected to this extreme abuse. It has no place in our sport. It has a devastating effect on our mental health and that of our loved ones. I will always stand up for my staff and volunteers. And let me be clear  without these people there would be no racing. We have to ask ourselves who would want to pursue becoming a top official in this environment The reality is obvious  if this continues it will destroy our sport. As the referee and as the President you of course expect people to disagree with the decisions you make. But you should expect that those opinions and comments are respectful. This is increasingly rare. Only through a collaborative approach will we achieve a measure of success in combatting this scourge on our sport. We have already initiated that process through the following actions We have entered into dialogue with social media platforms to play their part and we are beginning work with governments and fellow sports governing bodies to bring them together to make strong commitments for joint action. We are commissioning research via the FIA University into digital hate and toxic commentary specific to sport. This will provide a platform for knowledge sharing education and prevention. We have partnered with Arwen.ai to utilise their AI software to detect and eradicate abusive content on our own channels. Mohammed Ben Sulayem greets Mario Andretti Photo by Sam Bloxham  Motorsport Images In the coming months we will be launching a concerted campaign by leveraging the power and reach of our entire federation which numbers 244 motoring and sporting organisations in 146 countries on 5 continents. This campaign will build on the collaborative work by the FIA and Formula 1 through the Drive It Out initiative. I will be talking more about this at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix later this month. Passions run high in sport but online harassment abuse and hate speech must not be tolerated. Everyone in our sport from the media teams drivers and fans has a role to play. We cannot ignore this. I urge the entire motorsport ecosystem to take a stand. We must call it out. It has to stop.
The Mercedes ace emerging from the shadow of an F1 legend, https://www.autosport.com/dtm/news/the-mercedes-ace-emerging-from-the-shadow-of-an-f1-legend/10396465/, The next most successful Mercedes drivers by that metric were Maro Engel GruppeM and his Winward teammate Maxi Gotz on three apiece. But once I found it I was very confident and staying with the same brand with the same team in the same championship really helped me. Actually sometimes I look back to 2017 when I had a good shot at the DTM championship. But Gerhard is such a legend hes doing an incredible job and hes such a huge name in motorsport so I can understand this. Auer is starting to step outside of his uncle Bergers shadow Photo by Alexander Trienitz, George Russell isnt the only Mercedes driver to have enhanced his reputation this year. The latest member of its junior scheme 16yearold Andrea Kimi Antonelli ran away with the Italian and ADAC Formula 4 series before contributing to Italys victory in last weeks FIA Motorsport Games by steamrolling the F4 division at Paul Ricard. And while anybody who has been paying attention to GT3 racing in recent years has been left in no doubt about Raffaele Marciellos abilities he only further underlined his credentials as one of the best sportscar racers outside the prototype classes by following his sweep of the Spa 24 Hours GT World Challenge Europe and overall titles with the ADAC GT Masters crown. Merely finishing second in the DTM therefore may not make for such an obviously standout campaign. But without a puncture at Spa that robbed him of 18 points and a likely second place finish Lucas Auer would have been crowned champion in a season where the DTMs level of competition took a huge step forward from its 2021 GT3 reboot. The series at times resembled a GT version of Formula E prior to the introduction of its duels qualifying format as unpredictability reigned supreme. Even a prime Paul the Octopus would be hard pressed to pick out a polesitter  it took until the 10th round of the season for an onmerit repeat  which made consistency preciously difficult to achieve. But against this backdrop Auer shone and despite the Mercedes contingent being the biggest of the field the Austrian was its best qualifier on seven occasions. The next most successful Mercedes drivers by that metric were Maro Engel GruppeM and his Winward teammate Maxi Gotz on three apiece. Victorious in the Portimao opener and Hockenheims disrupted Saturday race Auer was one of just four drivers to win more than once and despite his Spa disappointment had closed a 20point deficit to Sheldon van der Linde at the halfway point of the season to just two heading into the final race. Unfortunately for Auer he was one of several drivers adversely affected by the decision not to restart qualifying following a late red flag and had to line up seven grid spots behind his rival in 11th. That was rendered somewhat moot in the race as with his 25kg in success ballast Auer lacked the pace of van der Lindes Schubert BMW M4 in the race  but he still has every reason to be pretty happy with how it went. Auer starred in the DTM this year and could count himself unlucky at not taking the title Photo by Alexander Trienitz Especially in Hockenheim when really the pressure was on I have to say the whole team delivered to an incredibly high level he tells Autosport. Spa was painful but I think everybody all of us had some painful experience. But overall it was a consistent season with some highlights. That Auers wins tally matched his 2021 total  he would have taken a third win in the nowinfamous Norisring finale without the imposition of team orders to favour eventual champion Gotz  underplays the step forward the 28yearold made in 2022. As Gotz left HRT and joined Auer at Winward he was only on the podium once  with a second place at Spa he inherited after Auers leftfront tyre gave up  and finished 11th in the standings. Auer acknowledges that continuity has been an important factor in his strong campaign having benefitted from working with the same team for the first time since 2018. That year was the last of Mercedes involvement in the DTM and prompted Auer to split from the brand hed represented since his arrival to the series in 2015. If we stay together we have a chance for the title. In a championship like this its not tenths its hundredths which make the difference so it is good to build up some experience that you know your engineer you are working together a couple of seasons Lucas Auer Basically it was the end of an era he says. Everybody had to look for something else. He pursued a return to singleseaters for 2019 in Japans Super Formula series funded by Red Bull that peaked with a third place at Sugo. Then came a return to the DTM for 2020 with BMW. At the Lausitzring Auer claimed one of just two nonAudi wins that season van der Linde incidentally took the other at Assen. But Audis withdrawal cast the future of the DTM into uncertainty and meant factoryrun teams became a thing of the past. BMW couldnt commit to a programme for Auer in 2021 the last year for the venerable M6 GT3 and so a parting of the ways was agreed that led him back into the Mercedes fold once more. Last year it took me some time to get familiar with the GT3 to find the last two tenths basically Auer says. But once I found it I was very confident and staying with the same brand with the same team in the same championship really helped me. This I didnt have for a long time I was changing quite a lot the last years so this gave me a massive boost in confidence. After a brief stint at BMW in 2020 Auer has found consistency and comfort to truly deliver in the DTM Photo by Alexander Trienitz While Auer will admit that he couldnt have planned his turbulent journey of recent years  BMW was never intended to be a oneyear stop it was a longer plan but this is how it worked out at the end  he acknowledges that his experience has made him a more rounded driver. Although not in terms of speed  I dont believe that he says. Maybe the technical part I understand better but the experience helps me so much. Also my experience with Japan. Actually sometimes I look back to 2017 when I had a good shot at the DTM championship. With this experience now it would have been so much better Auer knows hes in a good position now to make good on that massive experience in 2023. Should he remain with Winward  and theres no reason to expect that wont materialise given Auer says we have a very healthy relationship and Auers new deal with AMG was announced over the weekend  then hell automatically be regarded as one of the favourites next year. Definitely if we stay together we have a chance for the title he says. In a championship like this its not tenths its hundredths which make the difference so it is good to build up some experience that you know your engineer you are working together a couple of seasons. It helps massively because the weekend is so short you have to be spot on straight away and if not you have to really know what to do in order to get it right. As for his future Auer admits that hes interested by a return to prototype racing amid the current boom of manufacturer interest in HypercarGTP having dipped a toe in the water racing for Colin Kolles in the World Endurance Championship almost a decade ago. He made an LMP2 oneoff in the 2013 Bahrain finale before three further outings in 2014 aboard Kolles nonhybrid LMP1. Poor reliability plagued the project but Auer refutes the notion that it was a distraction during his racewinning 2014 FIA Formula 3 European championship campaign as he ended up fourth behind Esteban Ocon Tom Blomqvist and one Max Verstappen. Auer picked up vital experience during his F3 days competing against the likes of Verstappen and Ocon Photo by Sutton Images On the contrary he believes it was an advantage to have his eyes opened by working with more experienced drivers and it certainly seemed to have a positive impact at Macau later that year. Auer was second to Felix Rosenqvist in a Mucke Motorsport 12 ahead of future F1 racers Roberto Merhi Nicholas Latifi Verstappen Antonio Giovinazzi Ocon and 2021 IndyCar champion Alex Palou. What is happening in Le Mans is definitely on my radar and I think for probably every driver he acknowledges. Everybody who says not is lying It will be really interesting I think its really cool what is happening there. On the other hand I have to say DTM is just mega. If Auer continues his upward trend in 2023 then that ongoing process to emerging from his uncles shadow will be another step closer to completion Wherever Auer ends up in the future hes doing enough to be recognised as his own man. Hes no longer automatically referred to as the nephew of Gerhard Berger who heads up the ITR organisation which promotes and organises the DTM although Auer graciously recognises why that distinction was so commonly made. I remember when I went to DTM it was always the nephew of and I was like bloody hell he chuckles. But Gerhard is such a legend hes doing an incredible job and hes such a huge name in motorsport so I can understand this. But I feel every year  in terms of the press or how people see me  its more Lucas Auer and I think its a natural process. And if Auer continues his upward trend in 2023 then that ongoing process to emerge from his uncles shadow will be another step closer to completion. Should he realise his longheld goal of winning the DTM then in the public consciousness his family connection may finally become an afterthought.

Ricciardo has been linked with possible reserve roles at Red Bull and Mercedes since his exit from McLaren was confirmed but he is yet to make any formal announcement about his 2023 plans. Asked about the speculation linking Ricciardo to Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff said he thought the Australian was speaking to a few teams about a potential role I think also Red Bull. For us we very much like him hes a great character said Wolff. But we are not in a position yet to decide who is going to be reserve and third driver. Mercedes finds itself in need of a new reserve driver for next year as its current backups Nyck de Vries and Stoffel Vandoorne have both secured new roles.

Pourchaire in line for Super Formula test with Kondo Racing, https://www.motorsport.com/super-formula/news/pourchaire-kondo-toyota-test-merhi/10396576/, Should he indeed elect to leave the series Super Formula would offer a logical alternative for the 19yearold Frenchman while he waits for a potential F1 race chance in 2024. Motorsport.com understands that Pourchaire has been in touch with Kondo Racing about the possibility of replacing Fenestraz who is unavailable for all bar the final two rounds of the 2023 Super Formula season as his Nissan Formula E deal will take precedence. Additionally racing in Super Formula would make him unavailable to Alfa Romeo for three grand prix weekends due to clashes  namely the EmiliaRomagna GP in May the Canadian GP in June and the Mexican GP in October.

Motorsport.com understands that Pourchaire has been in touch with Kondo Racing about the possibility of replacing Fenestraz who is unavailable for all bar the final two rounds of the 2023 Super Formula season as his Nissan Formula E deal will take precedence. It now appears likely that Pourchaire will participate in the rookie test at Suzuka on December 78 in one of Kondos two Toyotapowered cars with Kazuto Kotaka who won the Super Formula Lights this year in the other. Kenta Yamashita is set to not participate in the test but looks on course to remain at Kondo for a seventh consecutive season. However it remains to be seen whether a test outing for Pourchaire would translate into a race drive as reports have also linked him to a potential third season in F2 with ART Grand Prix despite his previous keenness to move on. Additionally racing in Super Formula would make him unavailable to Alfa Romeo for three grand prix weekends due to clashes  namely the EmiliaRomagna GP in May the Canadian GP in June and the Mexican GP in October.

And with the companies being competitors of each other Di Resta believes Audi will want to aim right for the top when they arrive in the pit lane  by trying to knock Mercedes off their perch. Would you want to be at Audi in the first couple of years when they come into Formula 1 Would you entice a big driver to come in there a Charles Leclerc a Lando Norris to lead the team From a media point of view thats what they will have their sights on.Read more Valtteri Bottas planning to stick around for huge opportunity with Audi, Paul di Resta thinks the big target for Audi when they enter F1 in 2026 will be to get the better of German rivals Mercedes. After more than a year of speculation it was confirmed at this seasons Belgian Grand Prix that Audi part of the Volkswagen Group would participate in Formula 1 for the first time when the next generation of power units kicks in from 2026. More recently came the announcement that Audi would provide the engines for a works team under their name which would be run by the Sauber operation in Switzerland who currently race under the Alfa Romeo banner. Although it will be far from easy to replicate the success they have enjoyed in other motorsport disciplines  notably endurance racing touring cars Formula E and further back rallying  Audi will not want to be merely making up the numbers. And with the companies being competitors of each other Di Resta believes Audi will want to aim right for the top when they arrive in the pit lane  by trying to knock Mercedes off their perch. Thats massive isnt it at the end of the tunnel when you think about it said former F1 racer Di Resta on Sky Sports in response to a question about whether Audis arrival is a big incentive for current Sauber drivers Valtteri Bottas and Zhou Guanyu. Im interested to see where the investment will come from Audi. Sauber have always been there they have kind of been a midfield team that never really broke through that barrier of getting up there and being able to entice the right people in. But with Audi there I think youve got that. Would you want to be at Audi in the first couple of years when they come into Formula 1 Im not sure where the reliability will be. Would you entice a big driver to come in there a Charles Leclerc a Lando Norris to lead the team Thats what well have to wait and see but its great to have that brand in. They have been very successful in other motorsports and with the might of VW they will want to come in and make an impression. I think the biggest incentive for them is to beat Mercedes. From a media point of view thats what they will have their sights on. Read more Valtteri Bottas planning to stick around for huge opportunity with Audi

The first of those was Estonias Paul Aron who finished third in the last two seasons of Formula Regional European Championship by Alpine FRECA. Mercedes junior Aron 18 made his singleseater debut with Prema in 2019 in the Italian F4 Championship and competed with the team in FRECA in 2021 and 2022 after a oneyear stint at ART Grand Prix in Formula Renault Eurocup. Confirmed to be joining Aron at Prema is Dino Beganovic one of his FRECA teammates for the past two seasons. Beganovic also 18 made his car racing debut with Prema a year after Aron but eventually caught up to him on the ladder. After a disappointing rookie season in FRECA last year the SwedishBosnian driver won the title this season in convincing fashion with four wins and 13 podiums. Both Aron and Beganovic visited the F3 paddock as team guests in 2022  the former at SpaFrancorchamps and the latter a week later at Zandvoort. The third driver has not been officially announced though F1 Feeder Series understands that the place will be taken by Zak OSullivan who tested alongside Aron and Beganovic at the Jerez postseason test. OSullivan a member of the Williams Driver Academy made a strong impression at Carlins F3 team this season taking two podiums and the teams first pole position en route to 11th in the championship standings. The teams 2022 drivers are all expected to be headed to Formula 2 next year. Ollie Bearman is expected to step up to one of the teams F2 seats while Arthur Leclerc and Jak Crawford are set to head elsewhere  the former most probably to DAMS and the latter to Hitech his 2021 F3 team. Trident Trident the 2021 teams champions are expected to field an allrookie lineup for the 2023 season. FRECA race winner Gabriel Bortoleto was the first driver announced for the year just a few days after testing. Bortoleto recently added to F1 champion Fernando Alonsos A14 Management scheme impressed in the threeday postseason test by setting the quickest time overall on Thursday morning. F1 Feeder Series understands that Bortoleto had signed to compete for Trident by the Zandvoort weekend when he like Beganovic was present as a team guest. Alongside Bortoleto breakout Euroformula Open EFO champion Oliver Goethe is set to join Trident for 2023. Alongside his EFO campaign  which yielded 11 wins and topsix finishes in every race  Goethe drove for Campos Racing at the Hungaroring and Spa in place of Hunter Yeany who broke his wrist midseason. Monaco resident Goethe impressed by qualifying as the lead Campos driver at both events and finishing fourth in the Spa Feature Race just a day after a horror crash with Zane Maloney  whom he is set to replace at Trident  necessitated a new chassis. The final seat is expected to be taken by Leonardo Fornaroli the top rookie this past FRECA season. Fornaroli the 2021 Italian F4 fifthplace finisher is familiar with Trident having raced for them in 2022. Though the Italian driver never took an overall podium or a rookie win his consistency across the year put him eighth in the standings on 83 points. Once confirmed the trio will replace Jonny Edgar Roman Stank and Maloney. Stank and Maloney who finished 2022 fifth and second respectively are slated to move up to F2  Maloney as soon as Abu Dhabi this season  while Edgar looks set to remain in F3. ART Grand Prix With Martins title win at the final round of 2022 ART took a driver to the championship for the first time in the current iteration of FIA Formula 3. Martins is accordingly prohibited from returning to the category and all signs indicate that he will step up to F2 with ART. Teammate Juan Manuel Correa will also leave F3 though his exact destination is as yet unclear. Unlike the other teams that finished in the top five in 2022 ART fielded more than three drivers in postseason testing with the lineups presumed not to have been finalised by that point. The teams third driver from 2022 Grgoire Saucy is now confirmed to be remaining with ART for 2023 extending a relationship that dates back to his 2020 Formula Renault Eurocup season and includes his 2021 titlewinning campaign in FRECA. Saucy took a sole F3 podium in the Feature Race at Bahrain and ended the year 15th on 30 points. F3 veteran Kaylen Frederick who previously raced for Carlin and Hitech is one of the drivers from testing expected to take up an ART race seat for 2023. The American driver finished in the top 10 in each of the first four sessions before vacating his seat for the last day. Frederick was also seen entering the ART trailer with team boss Sbastien Philippe on Thursday of the Monza weekend likely for negotiations about 2023. Spanish F4 champion Nikola Tsolov an Alpine affiliate and Alonso protg completed all three days of testing for the team and set the most laps of the test with 261. Despite having just the Spanish F4 season under his belt Tsolov is thought to be the most likely contender for the third ART seat next year with Alonso reportedly pushing for him to jump ahead of F4 archrival and Mercedes junior Andrea Kimi Antonelli who will race in FRECA next season. The Bulgarian driver will turn 16 over the winter making him eligible for the FIA Grade B international licence that will grant him entry into the championship. Both Brad Benavides and Roberto Faria  who raced with Carlin this season in F3 and the GB3 Championship respectively  had also tested for ART but are not thought to be racing for the team in 2023. It is also understood that Laurens van Hoepen who was the teams guest at Zandvoort was under consideration for a race seat but will remain in FRECA for a second season. MP Motorsport While their F3 team could not replicate the heights that their F2 team reached this year MP Motorsport retained fourth place in the teams championship with Caio Collet Alexander Smolyar and Kush Maini. Smolyar and Maini are certain to move on from the team for 2023 while it is likely that Collet will pivot to endurance racing after a sophomore F3 campaign that did not yield the title challenge many expected. Though no 2023 seats have officially been announced those expected to join MP in their place are two experienced drivers with prior history at MP and one rookie. After finishing ninth overall with newcomers Van Amersfoort Racing this season Franco Colapinto looks set to rejoin MP with whom he finished third in the 2020 Formula Renault Eurocup and sixth in the 2021 FRECA season. Argentinas Colapinto a twotime F3 race winner was the fastest driver on the Friday of Jerez testing and generally impressed with his longrun pace. The second driver with F3 experience is the aforementioned Jonny Edgar who is expected to move across to MP from Trident. Edgar the 2020 ADAC F4 champion raced with Carlin in 2021 and with Trident in 2022 though he missed two races when complications from Crohns disease sidelined him. Edgar ended the year 12th scoring points in each of the last six races but never reaching the rostrum. It is thought that Edgar may no longer be a full member of the Red Bull Junior Team. After moving from ART to MP in the middle of his FRECA campaign Mari Boya of Spain is expected to continue with the Dutch team in F3. Boya also raced for MP Motorsport in his 2020 Spanish F4 campaign in which he finished second to Kas Haverkort but his FRECA stint with MP was far less successful with only two points finishes across eight races. Hitech Grand Prix Hitechs 2022 lineup included Red Bull junior Isack Hadjar who stayed in the fight for the drivers championship until the final race of the season. Hadjar is widely expected to be moving with the team to F2 with the teams other drivers Frederick and Nazim Azman set to head elsewhere. Instead the team is expected to field three drivers with varying levels of F3 experience. The most seasoned of those three is Reece Ushijima who raced in F3 this season for Van Amersfoort Racing and took a podium in the Sprint Race at Silverstone. Ushijima is a familiar face at Hitech having competed with the team in both 2020 and 2021 in the British F3 Championship  now called the GB3 Championship  and in the 2021 F3 Asian Championship. Also presumed to be at Hitech is Colombias Sebastin Montoya who raced as a Red Bull athlete for the second half of the racing season in advance of a possible promotion to full junior status. Montoya contested a single F3 round at Zandvoort in 2022 as a replacement for Yeany at Campos and finished in the top 10 in both races impressing many. His predicted step up to F3 comes off the back of a FRECA campaign with Prema that began with three rookie wins but soon tailed off with zero scores in the final eight races. Finally after winning the 2020 Italian F4 Championship and taking seventh and second in two FRECA seasons Italys Gabriele Min has been confirmed for a step to F3 with Hitech with whom he finished fourth in the Formula Regional Asian Championship FRAC last winter. Min topped the timesheets in the opening session of F3 postseason testing and impressed the rest of the week despite an accident later in that opening day that curtailed his running. Van Amersfoort Racing Van Amersfoort had a strong dbut in the championship this year to usurp several F3 regulars but their leading chargers Colapinto and Ushijima are headed elsewhere. Rafael Villagmez previously managed by VARs F3 team manager Tom Claessen is expected to remain with the Dutch outfit for a third season in F3. He scored his first career F3 points at the Sprint Race of this seasons Imola round. Several candidates have emerged as possibilities for the two seats alongside Villagmez. His compatriot Noel Len the 2021 F4 US champion and a Red Bullsupported driver in FRECA this year is one candidate for a step up though the extent of his Red Bull backing for next year is not clear. Len tested for the team on the first day as did Faria who lined up at ART Grand Prix for days two and three but looks more likely to land at VAR. The team fielded two new drivers on the last two days. Though one of them Lorenzo Flux is expected to line up at Prema for a third FRECA season GB3 race winner Max Esterson is believed to be under consideration for a VAR seat though with other options also on the table. Kas Haverkort the teams lead driver in FRECA was VARs guest at his and their home race at Zandvoort but did not test for the team at Jerez. Carlin Carlin had their best season in FIA F3 in 2022 finishing seventh in the championship and taking 57 points 54 thanks to OSullivan and three thanks to Benavides. However neither of those two drivers  nor the teams third driver Enzo Trulli  are expected to return to the team with Carlins testing lineup at Jerez entirely different. It is believed that Carlin will take on Hunter Yeany who tested with the team on the first day of the Jerez test. Yeany the 2020 F4 US champion did a partial campaign with Charouz in 2021 and aimed for a full season with Campos in 2022 before a wrist injury forced him to miss three rounds. F1 Feeder Series understands that the American driver had been in talks with several teams during the season including Trident and Charouz before Carlin emerged as his most likely destination. Likely lining up alongside Yeany is Carlins 2022 British F4 runnerup Ollie Gray who like OSullivan is a member of the Williams academy. Gray was at Monza as a guest of Williams but also visited the Carlin F3 tent during his stay though it is not known if that visit had any connection to a possible F3 move. Unlike most drivers on this list Gray did not appear in postseason testing but he did partake in private testing of old GP3 cars at Spa alongside a number of other drivers. There are also several contenders for the third Carlin seat though the most probable one is GB3 runnerup Joel Granfors who tested for the team all three days at Jerez. Granfors was a dominant Formula Nordic champion in 2020 before moving to the UK for consecutive seasons in British F4 and GB3 both with Fortec Motorsport. FRECA race winner and 2021 runnerup Hadrien David tested with Carlin for two days in Jerez but budget issues have continually plagued the Alpineaffiliated French driver who now seems poised to switch to endurance racing. Arias Deukmedjian who has contested partial seasons in a variety of F4 championships since 2021 did all three days with the team in Jerez but is thought to be pursuing other opportunities among them focusing on his academic career at Princeton University. Campos Racing Campos Racing fielded two Spaniards in 2022 alongside the third seat variously occupied by Yeany Goethe and Montoya. F3 race winner David Vidales singleseater career is reportedly imperilled by budget issues but 2022 FRAC runnerup Pepe Mart is slated to continue with Campos who also took him to third in the 2021 Spanish F4 Championship. Mart scored only two points in a difficult 2022 F3 campaign but was in the top five in five of the six sessions in testing at Jerez. Three drivers spent two days each in the second Campos seat and two of those have emerged as the most likely candidates to fill the remaining two seats. Christian Mansell the thirdplace finisher in both GB3 in 2021 and Euroformula Open in 2022 drove two races for Charouz Racing System in F3 this year with the intention of making the jump to the category on a fulltime basis in 2023. Also slated for a move up is Australias Hugh Barter who has contested a dual campaign in Spanish F4 and French F4 this season. While there is still one round of Spanish F4 left Barter racing for Campos looks almost certain to wrap up second place after sweeping the most recent race weekend at Navarra. In his second season of French F4 Barter took 10 wins and would have won the championship were it not for a rule that prevented drivers from scoring points in races held on circuits where they had previously raced that year. Francesco Pizzi who raced for Charouz in 2022 also tested with the team for two days though he is believed to be eyeing a move to the United States to continue his racing career with competitive opportunities in Europe drying up. Jenzer Motorsport Jenzer Motorsport are set to bring in an allrookie lineup for 2023 featuring a Euroformula Open podium finisher and two F4 graduates who have gotten to know each other as teammates. The team will also enter uncharted territory on the management side with recently formed F4 outfit PHM Racing forming a partnership with the Swiss team as founder and owner Andreas Jenzer looks towards retirement. This collaboration has enabled Taylor Barnard and Nikita Bedrin two of PHMs drivers in F4 to prepare for a likely step up to F3. Barnard an especially decorated karter did a partial season of ADAC F4 last year and a dual campaign in ADAC and Italian F4 this year along with F4 UAE in the winter. Between the three series he picked up six wins and 12 podiums and finished second to Antonelli in ADAC F4. He was regularly Jenzers top driver in the Jerez test. Though Bedrin did not reach the same heights as Barnard this season with just a single ADAC F4 win under his belt and two podiums in Italian F4 the Belgorodborn driver had the stronger record in 2021. He took fifth overall in ADAC F4 and rookie champion honours alongside eighth in Italian F4 and during the offseason he finished fourth in F4 UAE with two wins just one point away from third. Another expected signing is lex Garca of Mexico who finished seventh in Euroformula Open this season as the last of the fullseason participants. The best result of his season was a podium at Monza his first in singleseaters since the 201819 NACAM F4 Championship. Despite having experience of a higher level of racing than both Barnard and Bedrin Garca struggled in postseason testing at Jerez bringing up the rear in all but one of the sessions. Jenzers F3 lineup this season of Ido Cohen Federico Malvestiti and William Alatalo all have unclear futures. It is thought that Alatalo the teams bestperforming driver in 2022 might not return to the cockpit next year if he cannot find the money. He is currently in Finland completing his military service requirements. Charouz Racing System Charouz Racing System fielded eight drivers in 2022 including six in the 15 car largely granted to whoever was willing to pay for a drive. With fulltime drivers Pizzi and Lszl Tth presumed to be moving on from the F3 squad  the latter possibly to F2  the teams 2023 lineup is unclear with a number of candidates emerging for the seats but few appearing firmly committed to a seat. The most likely candidate for a race seat is Alessandro Famularo who raced with the team at Monza and stated to F1 Feeder Series his intentions of remaining in the series in 2023. Famularos weekend at Monza was the Venezuelan drivers return to the cockpit after nearly a year and a half away he had last raced with G4 Racing in FRECA but did not score any points in three rounds. Alongside Famularo for all three days of the test was Nicola Marinangeli who has spent several seasons at the Formula Regional level but with little more than occasional points to show for it. The Italian drivers best season was the 2020 F4 UAE Championship in which he finished fifth. Both Matas Zagazeta and Emmo Fittipaldi Jr. tested for Charouz at Jerez and are believed to be among several possible occupants of the seat. Peruvian driver Zagazeta the 2021 British F4 runnerup took part in the last two days of the test as rumours about the future of Charouz began to circulate with one possibility being that G4 Racing Zagazetas current FRECA team would take over the Czech outfit. Fittipaldi scored four points this Italian F4 season his second in cars and tested for Charouz on the first day at Jerez. Though he has been rumoured for a step up the 15yearold driver faces a barrier in that the Bahrain round comes just a few days before he turns 16 leaving him unable to obtain the licence required to compete in the season opener. Fittipaldis connection to Charouz is strengthened by his nephew Enzo 21 who has raced for Charouz in both F3 and F2 since 2021 and has scored several podiums this season but is slated to move to Carlin for 2023.

What Sauber needs to do to be an F1 winner with Audi, https://the-race.com/formula-1/what-sauber-needs-to-do-to-be-an-f1-winner-with-audi/, When BMW acquired the Sauber team in mid2005 it took just three seasons to transform the perennial Formula 1 midfielder into a race winner. Audi aims to do the same thing after buying into Sauber  the question is how long it will take. He argues that while Sauber undoubtedly needs to make progress getting to such a level isnt out of reach. Ferrari will continue to supply Sauber with engines until Audi arrives in 2026. Can Audi really win in F1 with Sauber, When BMW acquired the Sauber team in mid2005 it took just three seasons to transform the perennial Formula 1 midfielder into a race winner. Audi aims to do the same thing after buying into Sauber  the question is how long it will take. What is officially called a strategic partnership doesnt formally start until 2026 when Audi will enter F1 with its own power unit built to the new engine regulations that will be introduced that year. Audis intention to buy into the team has been confirmed but its understood that process of acquiring whats expected to be a majority stake is already well under way. When Audi announced its F1 programme during the Belgian Grand Prix weekend in late August two months before its Sauber deal was officially revealed CEO Markus Duesmann said winning immediately is not realistic. But he did say that within the first three years we should be very competitive. Audi target adds unnecessary pressure to its new F1 project Read more Alfa Romeobadged Sauber is currently hanging onto sixth place in the constructors championship but is under intense pressure from Aston Martin having scored a paltry two points in the last 11 races. However recent floor and front wing upgrades have made it a Q3 car for the past two races. Valtteri Bottas who has scored 47 of the teams 53 points this season has vast experience of the facilities and personnel required to be a frontrunning F1 team from his five years with Mercedes from 201721. He argues that while Sauber undoubtedly needs to make progress getting to such a level isnt out of reach. Theres still a lot of work to do no doubt but its not that far says Bottas when asked by The Race how far Sauber has to go to be a frontrunning team. The facilities are there. Some machinery can be better compared to a championshipwinning team but its still feasible its still possible. Also the amount of people in the team has grown from what Ive seen last year so there is still some growth to do with the support from Audi. But I see no reason why we shouldnt get there.  Sauber will continue to run as Alfa Romeo until the end of next season and will not fully become the Audi team until the arrival of the engine in 2026. When asked by The Race what the team would be called in 202425 ahead of its expected rebranding as Audi in 2026 team principal Frederic Vasseur didnt give a clear answer stating that the name of the chassis will stay Sauber but we could have a title sponsor coming in. Currently Saubers car is officially called an Alfa Romeo so this does imply that its likely to return to the Sauber name. However this is not confirmed. Regardless of what the team is called Bottas says the 2024 and 2025 seasons will play a significant role in the teams readiness to emerge as a race winner on merit once the Audi engines arrive. That depends on how much Audi is going to support this team before they officially become a manufacturer says Bottas when asked by The Race if the targets to be good enough to be a frontrunning team  assuming the engine is strong enough  can be met by 2026. Obviously nothing changes next year were still with Alfa Romeo and of course we hope we can have a better car than this years. But then I think it depends on support well get from 2024 onwards how much are they willing to support. If theyre really upping a lot their support and the power unit is good in 2026 which is impossible to predict at the moment then why not Sauber has had a difficult time since the start of the V6 turbo hybrid era in 2014. Prior to this season it was always eighth or lower in the constructors championship and was in serious financial trouble before being bought by Swedish billionaire Finn Rausing in 2016. His investment not only stabilised the team but also allowed it to grow again. This season was regarded as particularly important given Sauber started the previous rules cycle in 2017 well off the pace owing to the underinvestment before Rausings takeover. The current campaign started well and Sauber was a regular Q3 runner but slid deeper into the midfield after failing to maintain the pace of development. This was partly down to the fact the team started the season on the weight limit and therefore had no headroom to make gains there while other teams did so. Speed of parts production is one area where Sauber needs to improve given the team has admitted it took too long to manufacture aerodynamic upgrades this year. But the team does already have good facilities including the highquality windtunnel that was paid for by the proceeds of selling Kimi Raikkonens contract to McLaren for 2002. This facility is well known to Audi Motorsport which has used it in the past on a customer basis for its Le Mans prototype programme. Vasseur has rightly pointed to the need for new recruits for a team that is set to operate at the cost cap next year having been below it in 2022 as part of the needed allround improvements. Performance comes from everywhere its never one single topic says Vasseur when asked by The Race what it will take to make Sauber a frontrunning team. We know that we are far too small in terms of headcount. We are something like 500 people today when some other teams around me are perhaps 200 more. Alpine will exceed 900 staff in push to match big F1 teams Read more We have to do a step forward but we have also three years to do it and it will be a challenge but I think the challenge is very positive. You know that when you have the light at the end of the tunnel and you know that you have to improve and you will have the resources to do it its a good challenge and that will be the best motivation for everybody into the company. But on the other hand I dont want to lose the path of the next two years because the best way to prepare for the future is also to perform and I want to keep the team motivated and focus on 2023 2024 and 2025. Vasseur is right to stress the need for continual improvements. Sauber has taken a big step forward this year to transform itself from a team that only scored 21 points across 202021 to one that has underachieved given its car pace but still banked 53 points this season. That highlights the need to continue to sharpen up operationally given it has lost points this season to unreliability  although part of the responsibility of that is on the shoulders of enginepartner Ferrari. Ferrari will continue to supply Sauber with engines until Audi arrives in 2026. Currently it also provides gearboxes this year only the internals as Sauber opted to make its own casing to allow it to run pushrod rear suspension and because this was felt to be more costeffective under the cost cap although its likely the team will have to produce its own inhouse gearboxes as part of its transition to becoming the Audi works team. Much will change for Sauber in the coming years as it ramps up ahead of 2026. However Vassuer has stressed that the chassis and the engine side will be split completely with the engine produced in Neuberg in Germany and the Sauber base in Hinwil in Switzerland designing and building the chassis. Can Audi really win in F1 with Sauber Our verdict Read more Vasseur insists that in the shortterm it wont have a big impact for us except that we know that we can go to the next step and it will be a huge opportunity in terms of recruitment and to be more attractive for sponsors. But he calls it a gamechanger in the longterm. Its clear that the intention is for the team to retain at least some of its Sauber identity despite this deal. Thats not dissimilar to what happened when BMW acquired the team as it officially ran as BMW Sauber from 200609 with team founder Peter Sauber retaining a 20 stake. We wont have personnel from Audi involved in the team and the chassis operation but we know that we have three years to build up something says Vasseur when asked at what point Audi personnel will be directly involved in the team. We know that we have three years to increase the budget and to be at the cost cap to work to improve the facilities and so and I think honestly that three years is not too much. But its the perfect trend. And I think it was the good timing also for Audi with the new regulations coming in on the engine side in 2026 and it was the perfect fit. The SauberAudi partnership is certainly ambitious. But the main difference between this situation and when BMW took over the team 17 years ago is the increased complexity of F1. As other teams have learned in recent times it takes years to evolve from a midfield operation into a frontrunner. But what Sauber and Audi have on their side is time specifically the fact there are three full seasons between now and the strategic partnership being fully realised in 2026. Given how far Sauber has to go its essential that time is maximised to have any chance of fulfilling Audis grand ambition of becoming genuinely competitive within three years of its arrival.
Daniel Ricciardo issues defence of pay drivers who reach Formula 1 level, https://www.planetf1.com/news/daniel-ricciardo-defends-f1-pay-drivers/, Daniel Ricciardo has said socalled pay drivers dont deserve the disrespect they get explaining that they still have to be pretty gnarly. The Australian driver believes that pay drivers ie. Another example of a socalled pay driver would be Williams Nicholas Latifi whose personal sponsorship roster helped him to a seat with the Grovebased squad for the past three seasons. Daniel Ricciardo Funding is needed from day oneBut Ricciardo believes drivers whose progress into F1 has been helped by their financial backing dont deserve the criticism they get as they still must have almost all of the same level of talent and ontrack success to reach the level of an F1 driver. You need to hang otherwise at some point it wont last.Read More Oscar Piastri completes private test in Francefor McLaren  report, Daniel Ricciardo has said socalled pay drivers dont deserve the disrespect they get explaining that they still have to be pretty gnarly. The Australian driver believes that pay drivers ie. drivers who may not be the absolute best drivers on the grid but offer financial incentives to teams for hiring them through their own wealth or that of sponsors or family get a bad reputation from fans of the sport. Ricciardo appeared on Your Moms House podcast where he joined hosts Tom Segura and Christina Pazsitzky in a discussion about his own F1 career and some of the intricacies of the sport. The conversation turned to the topic of pay drivers as the hosts poked fun at the drivers who are on the grid due to their daddies buying them a team  clearly meant as a dig against the likes of Aston Martins Lance Stroll whose father Lawrence purchased the former Racing Point squad in 2018. Another example of a socalled pay driver would be Williams Nicholas Latifi whose personal sponsorship roster helped him to a seat with the Grovebased squad for the past three seasons. Daniel Ricciardo Funding is needed from day one But Ricciardo believes drivers whose progress into F1 has been helped by their financial backing dont deserve the criticism they get as they still must have almost all of the same level of talent and ontrack success to reach the level of an F1 driver. Ill say look Im trying to like be respectful as well Ricciardo mused on the topic. To get into the sport and not even F1 just even to go gokarting as a kid  you need to spend thousands as opposed to hundreds if youre playing football you know a pair of boots and thats it pretty much. So youd certainly need some kind of funding whether its from family or sponsors. If the familys done it all then like sometimes people might be like that kid whatever. Ricciardo made the point that the driver still has to have plenty of pace as the sponsors behind that driver wouldnt stick around if the required talent level wasnt there to justify their investments. At the end of the day if youre driving once you get to like F2 or F1 even if someones paid your way there youre still putting your body on the line and all that he said. So theyre certainly at that level theres still an element of respect for sure. Because not everyone can do it. Like maybe their path was easier than others but theyre still pretty gnarly. A second in our sport is so much like if you were just constantly a second off or two seconds off then sponsors would pull out. You need to be at a certain level. You need to hang otherwise at some point it wont last. Read More Oscar Piastri completes private test in Francefor McLaren  report
This Gorgeous 450cc Retro-style Bike Is Made By An Ex-Formula 1 Team, https://www.zigwheels.com/news-features/general-news/this-gorgeous-450cc-retro-style-bike-is-made-by-an-ex-formula-1-team/47624/, Get latest updates onthe automobile community Login NowFormer underdog F1 team Hesketh which won several podiums and races with legendary racer James Hunt has a motorcycle division.

While the bike has been revealed through discreet images via social media the full reveal will take place tomorrow at EICMA. But the motor is built as per Heskeths specifications in Taiwan featuring twin ports twin injectors and a Euro5 certification.

The company which was revived in 2014 teased its allnew 450cc motorcycle christened the Heresy 450 a couple of months ago in August. While the bike has been revealed through discreet images via social media the full reveal will take place tomorrow at EICMA. The company claims its the most technically advanced Hesketh ever produced. At the heart lies a 450cc mill sourced from Honda originally belonging to a Honda XR400. And if we take the XR400s motor specs as a reference the mill should produce similar power figures if not more which are around 34PS and 33Nm. But the motor is built as per Heskeths specifications in Taiwan featuring twin ports twin injectors and a Euro5 certification. So we could expect better power figures. The Heresy 450 also features a KTech suspension a handbuilt tubular steel frame and radially mounted brake calipers with twin disc brakes up front  not something youd see on 450cc bikes these days. Oddly enough the bike runs a twin gascharged shock absorber set up at the back presumably with preload and rebound adjustment. Up front you have adjustable upside forks and an LED headlight. The twin underseat exhaust is yet another design element that enthusiasts would appreciate. Also carbon fibre components such as the fenders flyscreen and bodywork suggest that Hesketh has tried to keep the bikes weight in check. Designwise Hesketh has kept things simple. The smaller roadster sticks to the companys neoretro design language with minimal bodywork. The chiselled tank flows into a quilted seat with a seat cowl.

Seventime world champion Lewis Hamilton was awarded an honorary citizenship of Brazil in Brasilia. Lewis Hamilton returns to Brazil this weekend aiming for a milestone win in what is technically another home race. While that may sound baffling to some Hamilton  born and bred in Stevenage  is now an honorary Brazilian citizen. F1s seventime world champion is therefore set to rekindle a relationship with the Brazilian people that has had its ups and downs and for a homecoming at an Interlagos track where he has produced arguably his greatest ontrack moments. Hamiltons mission to secure his first win of the season will be a huge challenge given Max Verstappens 2022 dominance and Mercedes struggles. However to quote the great Murray Walker when Hamilton races in Sao Paulo it seems that anything could happen and it usually does... Brazilian Grand Prix 2008 Hamiltons first two seasons in Formula 1 saw Brazil the setting for final race deciders in which Hamilton certainly felt like he was on the away team. In 2007 the fans backed Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen teammate of Brazils Felipe Massa to the Finns first and only world championship victory. The following year the hostility turned up a notch when it became Massa who Hamilton battled for the title.

The agony Hamilton had experienced in 2007 he inflicted on the Brazilian people in 2008. The Britons villain status in Brazil was solidified for now. Hamilton celebrates his dramatic first title victory Ayrton Senna An important character in the story of Lewis Hamilton and Brazil is someone that the British driver never met. Ayrton Senna was and continues to be a hero to many Brazilians. The threetime F1 champion did not just raise his nations flag on the global stage with mesmerising drives but also helped lift communities through his charity work. Sennas state funeral  one of the biggest in Brazils history  went to show just how much he meant to the Brazilian people.

When reflecting on these two greats of F1 similarities in driving ability and charity are clear to see. A third less obvious comparison that can be drawn between the two is that neither were afraid to stand up for what they felt was correct even when it was only their voices that could be heard. Hamilton kisses Sennas helmet gifted to him after equalling the Brazilians pole record Sennas impact on Hamilton to fight for positive change even when feeling alone is something the Briton alluded to seven years ago ahead of his third championship drawing him level with Senna. If Ayrton had been able to continue he would have won many more races and many more championships so I think Im going to be carrying the baton for both of us said Hamilton in 2016. Striving to win more for the both of us Brazilian Grand Prix 2016 The Brazilian Grand Prix in 2016 is often remembered for the remarkable drive by Verstappen in torrential rain. Lewis Hamilton dominated his first win in Brazil It is easy to forget the driver who led the race from the start to the chequered flag. 2016 was Lewis Hamiltons first victory at Interlagos on his 10th attempt. On finally winning it was clear that triumphing in Brazil meant that little bit more with Hamilton shouting Yes Brazil as he donned a Senna tribute helmet. Perhaps this Sennalike drive along with Hamiltons embrace of his heros country helped change Hamiltons villainous perception in Brazil. Sao Paulo Grand Prix 2021 Last years epic victory by Hamilton in Brazil will go down in F1 history with Sky Sports F1s Damon Hill describing the seventime champions performance as one of the great drives that he had ever seen. Lewis Hamilton has won a race every season of his career except 2022 so far Hamilton entered the weekend with fierce rival Verstappen taking a significant lead in the title race after two big wins in Austin and Mexico. The Mercedes driver needed to win to keep the championship alive. After taking pole position on the Friday evening ahead of Saturdays Sprint Hamilton was disqualified due to his Mercedes rear wing flap opening 0.2mm more than the legal 85mm. Hamilton would start from the back of the field and to make matters worse he had a fiveplace grid penalty drop due to a new engine part from whatever he could make up in the Sprint. With a fast Mercedes and some brave overtakes Hamilton put in a mega drive to finish fifth securing 10th place as his grid slot for Sunday. He still had much work to do with Verstappen starting on the front row. Sunday came and Hamilton made his way into second position before battling Verstappen for the lead. The seasons controversy continued seeing Verstappen run both drivers off track and not being penalised much to Mercedes frustration. But eventually Hamilton snatched the lead took the victory and celebrated with the fans that had been cheering him all weekend draped in the green yellow and blue flag of Brazil. Taking victory in the face of adversity has been a hallmark of Senna and Hamiltons career. Hamilton winning that race and dedicating it to the people of Brazil created a bond that ultimately led to a successful request to make Hamilton an honorary citizen of what the Brit described as one of my favourite places. The Mercedes driver said in front of congress on Monday as he was named an honorary citizen I feel like now Im one of you. So this weekend Hamilton will see Brazil again. His relationship with Brazil will remain special whether or not he is victorious but if Hamilton wins at all this year Interlagos is a place that would embrace it more than many.

Every time I do these sprint races its about Dont get damage make sure you stay in the top three he said. For me thats not really a race because you go into the main race and you know there are way more points available anyway you just risk a bit more there. You do another start in a sprint race which is exciting but its only really people who are out of position that move forward because you just put a tyre on that lasts a whole stint and not much happens. Verstappen argued F1 should just stick to the main race as that is where the racing is best showcased. I dont understand what the problem is with that because weve had so many exciting races so you dont need to add onethird of a race distance he said.

Regardless of the official name of the Grand Prix Interlagos is still the same circuit where Lewis Hamilton has won and lost a World Championship by one point 2007 and 2008. Fifteen turns over 2.677 miles 4.309 km comprise one lap around Interlagos or the Autdromo Jos Carlos Pace. Barring weather restrictions the Sao Paul Grand Prix is scheduled for 71 laps while the final F1 Sprint Race is scheduled for twentyfour laps. Well get to last years winner whose performance warrants his own section in our preview. Notably the Sa Paulo Grand Prix is at a similar altitude to Austrias Red Bull Ring. Why is altitude important to consider Its because of turbocharger performance and construction. Ferrari is believed to have a smaller turbocharger than Red Bull Power Trains Honda or Mercedes which enables the turbocharger to speed up quicker helping with exit corner speed. However much of the Ferrari power unit issues that have plagued the Ferraripowered runners throughout the season can be attributed to the fragility of the Turbocharger. Unlike the Red BullHonda power unit that has excelled at altitude weve heard the Ferrari turbochargers uncomfortable whine in management mode during the Mexico City Grand Prix leaving both Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz well off the pace of the frontrunners. At the same time Carlos Sainzs Austrian Grand Prix ended in a firefilled power unit failure. Sa Paulo Grand Prix Prediction 1 Dont take Ferrari to challenge for the win in either race. Taking either Ferrari driver to finish in the top 6 or to score points is the only bet wed entertain on Ferrari this coming weekend. Sa Paulo Grand Prix Prediction 2 Aside from picking the number 1 car to win the Sa Paulo Grand Prix and the F1 Spring Qualifying Race weve got another lock for your betting picks. Trust us on this one take Mercedes George Russell to finish in the top six. Russell has only landed in the top 6 in seventeen of the twenty races this season. The 2021 Sa Paulo Grand Prix or Lewis Hamiltons Greatest Weekend in Formula 1 I understand how much territory you need to cover to assess the validity of that subheading considering Lewis Hamilton is the most successful Formula 1 driver ever and is a seventime World Champion frankly almost ninetime Champion. Hamilton is arguably the greatest Formula 1 driver of all time and I argue that his career masterpiece was the 2021 Sa Paulo Grand Prix weekend. If you only focus on the Grand Prix results you are missing the bulk of the story. In true Formula 1 fashion its lights out and away we go as we review Lewis Hamiltons legendary 2021 Sa Paulo Grand Prix weekend. And uncharacteristically this story starts from the back of the grid for the man who holds the record for most pole positions. First we all know how contentious the battle for the 2021 World Drivers Championship was. Were not revisiting that hornets nest and invoking the ire of the Orange army or Sky Sports commentators  who despite what they argue demonstrate a significant and expected bias toward British drivers and against everything Red Bull on their broadcasts compared to the F1TV broadcast crew. This bias is evident despite historically landing Red Bull team principal Christian Horner for inrace media duties for years including the 2021 edition of this Grand Prix when the likes of Mercedes Toto Wolff hadnt made many appearances at all. Second Mercedes had two secret weapons to deploy for the seasons last four races. The first was an ingenious technological trick to drop the W12s ride height once it hit a certain speed on the straights making the W12 a little faster on the straights. More importantly one DNF classification due to power unit reliability would be enough to end Hamiltons pursuit of World Championship number eight. When testing the 2021 power units one power unit had a little extra Mercedes magic purely by happenstance. Dubbed the spicy engine Mercedes opted to put that power unit into Hamiltons W12 at Interlagos. Hamilton put the spicy engine to good use through all three sessions despite the fiveplace grid penalty for the new internal combustion engine and being disqualified from qualifying for his DRS opening not meeting the technical specifications. This sent Hamilton to the back of the grid for the Sprint Race despite putting up a 107.934 in Qualifying 3 threetenths faster than Max Verstappens pole position for the Sprint Race. 2021 Sa Paulo Sprint From his starting position of 20th it was clear from lights out that Hamilton was on rare form with an incredible start. As the laps of the sprint race counted down Hamilton gave us a preview of what was to come on Sunday finishing the Sprint Race in P5 only 20.872 seconds behind race winner Valtteri Bottas. The real preview for Sunday was in the alternate lines around the circuit that Hamilton used to facilitate his dissection of the field. These different lines were off the beaten path but gave Hamilton the positioning and traction through the corners to quickly dispatch the field. In the 2021 Sa Paulo Sprint Lewis Hamilton passed fifteen cars in twentyfour laps on the way to a P5 Sprint Race finish. Hamiltons fiveplace engine penalty was implemented for the Grand Prix moving Hamiton back to a P10 start. 2021 Sa Paulo Grand Prix This is where Lewis Hamiltons alternative lines were in full effect as Hamilton destroyed the field until he got to Max Verstappen. Verstappen knew his lead wasnt going to last and battled with Hamilton over a few laps doing everything he could to keep the W12 behind him. Max famously even attempted to drive Hamilton as far off the track as possible as both drivers battled for P1. Why would Verstappen try to drive Hamilton out of the circuit and into the neighboring community Because Lewis Hamilton was inevitable and unstoppable at Interlagos. Verstappen and Red Bulls only chance to keep Hamilton beyond him was to drive him into the neighborhood and as far from the circuit as possible. Lewis Hamilton won the 2021 Sa Paulo Grand Prix passing Max Verstappen and finishing 10.496 seconds ahead of Verstappen. That means over 95 laps at Interlagos Lewis Hamilton passed every driver on the grid at least once passing all but four drivers at least twice and finishing at least a lap ahead of fourteen cars during the grid in the Grand Prix. And he did it starting from the back of the grid during the Sprit race and mired in the midfield mess for the Grand Prix. Knowing what we know and rereviewing the 2021 Sa Paulo Grand Prix makes Hamiltons weekend even more special than the results could suggest. Up Next The 2022 Sa Paulo Grand Prix The secondtolast race on the 2022 Formula 1 calendar is up next and clearly its the Sa Paulo Grand Prix which takes place from November 1113. There is action on all three days of the weekend Qualifying is on Friday the Sprint Race is on Saturday and the Grand Prix is on Sunday. Unfortunately for Sky Sports stalwarts Crofty David Croft and Ted Kravitz there is no Mercedes magic or spicy engine to help Lewis Hamilton overcome Max Verstappen and Red Bull whose win at Interlagos in 2022 seems as inevitable as Hamiltons in 2021.

The 2021 Russian Grand Prix happened in September with Lewis Hamilton winning and Max Verstappen and Carlos Sainz joining him on the podium. In May Richard Newman of Eurosport reported F1 organizers decided not to replace the Russian Grand Prix on the 2022 slate. That means drivers will have a threeweek break between the Italian Grand Prix on Sept. 11 and the race in Singapore on Oct. 2. It seems as if the sport has no future plans to return to Russia as the invasion of Ukraine continues., Dan Istitene  Formula 1Formula 1 via Getty Images Formula 1 racing is the latest sport to shift away from Russia following the countrys invasion of Ukraine. There will be no more racing in Russia Formula 1 CEO Stefano Domenicali said ht ESPN F1. The 2021 Russian Grand Prix happened in September with Lewis Hamilton winning and Max Verstappen and Carlos Sainz joining him on the podium. There is no Russian Grand Prix on the 2022 schedule. In May Richard Newman of Eurosport reported F1 organizers decided not to replace the Russian Grand Prix on the 2022 slate. The decision to cancel the annual event held in Sochi was made following the invasion. Newman noted there was some discussion of holding a race at a different venue or perhaps even a doubleheader in Singapore but the decision was made to stick to 22 races this year. That means drivers will have a threeweek break between the Italian Grand Prix on Sept. 11 and the race in Singapore on Oct. 2. The sports world responded quickly to Russias invasion with many either suspending athletes from the nation from competing or withdrawing events from the country. Matias Grez Patrick Sung and Wayne Sterling of CNN kept a running list of responses in March which included the International Paralympic Committee banning Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in the 2022 Winter Paralympics FIFA and UEFA suspending all Russian international and club teams and the International Tennis Federation canceling events in Russia and Belarus. As for F1 the World Motor Sport Council decided to ban competitions within Russia and Belarus. It also ruled drivers from the countries could participate as neutral competitors without flags or national anthems. Whats more the Haas F1 team ended its contract with Russian driver Nikita Mazepin and its title sponsor Uralkali. It seems as if the sport has no future plans to return to Russia as the invasion of Ukraine continues.

Wolff not underestimating Audi's Formula 1 intent, https://www.speedcafe.com/2022/11/08/wolff-not-underestimating-audis-formula-1-intent/, Mercedes boss Toto Wolff is taking Audis entry into Formula 1 seriously ahead of its official debut in 2026. To begin I would never underestimate the Volkswagen Group whether its Audi or Porsche when they enter into such a project Wolff began. Alfa Romeo is a title sponsor which will part ways with the team at the end of the season. It will remain powered by Ferrari until the end of 2025 at which point it will switch to Audi. Wolff is a onethird shareholder in the Mercedes Formula 1 team with the other twothirds split equally between Ineos and Daimler AG., Mercedes boss Toto Wolff is taking Audis entry into Formula 1 seriously ahead of its official debut in 2026. Over the Belgian Grand Prix weekend the German marque announced it would enter the sport as a power unit manufacturer once the new regulations came into effect. It noted at the time that an announcement on how it would enter as a competitor and subsequently confirmed as much in the lead up to the Mexico City Grand Prix. Audi will become a strategic partner of Sauber for 2026 with the Swissbased operation set to become the car makers factory team. To begin I would never underestimate the Volkswagen Group whether its Audi or Porsche when they enter into such a project Wolff began. They have the financial strength the knowhow the racing expertise to come up with a great project. And I think the marriage with Sauber is something that fits its in Switzerland its GermanSwitzerland it operates under the same legislative environment. I have them absolutely on the radar  absolutely part of the teams that can be successful in 2026. Sauber operates the Alfa Romeo squad and is known to be one of the handful of operations which works below Formula 1s cost cap. Alfa Romeo is a title sponsor which will part ways with the team at the end of the season. It will remain powered by Ferrari until the end of 2025 at which point it will switch to Audi. Wolff is a onethird shareholder in the Mercedes Formula 1 team with the other twothirds split equally between Ineos and Daimler AG.
Max Verstappen calls on Formula 1 to just "stick to the main race on Sunday", https://www.planetf1.com/news/max-verstappen-stick-main-race-sunday/, In late summer the now double World Champion was quoted as saying I just dont like the sprints. During every sprint race Im like dont get any damage make sure you stay in the top three said the Red Bull driver quoted by Motorsport.com. For me thats not really racing because you know there are a lot more points to be earned in the main race. Then not much happens.In saying Formula 1 should simply just stick to the main race on Sunday Verstappen does not see the need for extra action because he thinks the grands prix themselves tick the box in terms of providing entertainment. You probably wont take that risk so its not really a race.Read more Why Max Verstappen has lack of excitement about breaking F1 win record, Max Verstappen has again hit out at F1 sprints in the buildup to the third and last of those events for this season which takes place in Brazil. Formerly known as sprint qualifying and now simply referred to as sprint by Formula 1 themselves three of these shorter races have been rostered for both 2021 and 2022. Verstappen has a 100 record in them this year winning at Imola and Austrias Red Bull Ring while last season he took victory in the first one ever at Silverstone before finishing second to Mercedes Valtteri Bottas at Monza and Interlagos. The Sao Paulo venue was the only one retained to stage another sprint in this campaign but in 2023 the number will double to six. That is six too many as far as Verstappen is concerned. In late summer the now double World Champion was quoted as saying I just dont like the sprints. The emotions on a Sunday should be special. Thats the only day you should race. Thats how I grew up. He has now had another pop referring to the caution many drivers apply to sprints because they do not want to jeopardise their chances of a good result in the main event by getting involved in an incident that could potentially send them to the back of the grid. During every sprint race Im like dont get any damage make sure you stay in the top three said the Red Bull driver quoted by Motorsport.com. For me thats not really racing because you know there are a lot more points to be earned in the main race. In that you take a bit more risk. You have an extra start. Thats exciting. But other than that its only the drivers who are not in their usual position who come to the front because the tyres last a whole race. Then not much happens. In saying Formula 1 should simply just stick to the main race on Sunday Verstappen does not see the need for extra action because he thinks the grands prix themselves tick the box in terms of providing entertainment. I dont understand whats wrong with that because weve had so many exciting races he added. You dont have to add one third of a race distance. Everyone is so careful because if you make light contact in the fight for P3 for example and fall back to last place you know you will have a tough Sunday. You probably wont take that risk so its not really a race. Read more Why Max Verstappen has lack of excitement about breaking F1 win record
‘Eight-time champ’ Hamilton granted Brazilian citizenship; French star at risk of ban: F1 Pit Talk, https://www.foxsports.com.au/motorsport/formula-one/eighttime-champion-hamilton-granted-brazilian-citizenship-french-star-at-risk-of-race-ban-f1-pit-talk/news-story/a5c32bacb30377909caf11de2e367dd7, EIGHTTIME CHAMPION HAMILTON MADE AN HONORARY BRAZILIANLewis Hamilton has been granted his honorary Brazilian citizenship in a special sitting of the countrys lower house on Monday. Its unclear whether Max Verstappen and Red Bull Racing will boycott the nation of Brazil in response. GASLY RISKS RACE BAN BEFORE ALPINE SWITCHPierre Gasly is perilously close to being suspended after reaching 10 penalty points at the Mexico City Grand Prix. He was banned from a race in 2012 and the penalty points system was introduced in 2014 to create a formalised process to punish reckless driving. Collecting his 12th penalty point in the seasonending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix would see him miss his debut race for Alpine next season., Lewis Hamilton has a long and deep history with Brazil. Now its been formalised with citizenship. The Briton has long identified Ayrton Senna as his racing hero and driving force and it was a dream come true to win his first championship in Sao Paulo in 2008. In that race he was the villain defeating home hero Felipe Massa but his passion was undimmed and its a testament to his affinity for the country that hes since won over the enthusiastic local crowd to the point that hes now welcomed back to the circuit as a local favourite. Watch every practice qualifying and race of the 2022 FIA Formula One World Championship live on Kayo. New to Kayo Start your free trial now  And this year he can actually say hes a local too having received his citizenship papers this week. Indeed hes so well regarded in Brazil that the national congress has been tempted to recognise him as having an extra championship. Just dont tell Red Bull Racing. Whether that boost in support can power him to a fourth victory in Sao Paulo is another question entirely. While Mercedes targets the track as a possible opportunity to snipe for a victory Pierre Gasly will just be hoping to keep a clean sheet given how perilously close he is to picking up a race ban after his latest driving infringement in Mexico. And Max Verstappen will be back on the television with Red Bull Racing set to end the feud with Sky Sports after allegations of biased coverage. EIGHTTIME CHAMPION HAMILTON MADE AN HONORARY BRAZILIAN Lewis Hamilton has been granted his honorary Brazilian citizenship in a special sitting of the countrys lower house on Monday. Hamilton was made a citizen earlier in the year after winning the Brazilian Grand Prix for a third time 2021 after an epic twoday comeback from the back of the grid. Hamilton had been excluded from qualifying for using a broken rear wing and started the Saturday sprint from last. He overtook 14 cars and finished fourth but then served a fiveplace penalty for an engine change putting him 10th on the grid for the grand prix. His raceday recovery put him in a fraught duel with Max Verstappen with the Dutchman controversially running him off the track in a desperate defensive move but Hamilton eventually swept past to record a dominant 10second victory. He stopped on the cooldown lap to collect a Brazilian flag which he unfurled as he drove back to pit lane and held aloft on the podium in scenes reminiscent of the home victories of his idol Ayrton Senna. Photo by NELSON ALMEIDA  AFP Source AFP It was the first of Hamiltons three wins in a row to put him level on points with Verstappen for the final race of the year. In a ceremony convened to formally grant him his citizenship Hamilton was praised for having a Brazilian heart and affinity with the Brazilian people and also for his social and environmental activism. It is honestly the greatest honour for me to be here receiving and accepting this citizenship he told the rapturous chamber. I really do feel like now Im one of you finally so thank you. Knowing you guys were cheering me on the way in 2021 it was one of the most special moments of my entire life. Hamilton dedicated the honour to Senna who he said inspired him to become a grand prix driver. When I was five years old I saw Ayrton race for the first time and that was the moment I knew that I wanted to be a world champion just like him he said. The session was otherwise notable for chamber president Arthur Lira identifying Hamilton as an eighttime world champion in a reference to the controversial conclusion to last years campaign. Its unclear whether Max Verstappen and Red Bull Racing will boycott the nation of Brazil in response. GASLY RISKS RACE BAN BEFORE ALPINE SWITCH Pierre Gasly is perilously close to being suspended after reaching 10 penalty points at the Mexico City Grand Prix. An F1 driver can collect a maximum of 11 points in a 12month period without repercussion but a 12th point will result in an automatic onerace ban. Gasly was given his 10th point along with a fivesecond penalty for passing Lance Stroll off track for 15th place. Just one week earlier in Austin he was handed two points for driving too slowly behind the safety car. Points expire one year after they were collected but Gasly isnt due to lose any more points until next May seven rounds into the new season and nine races from now. The Frenchman was furious in Mexico to learn that hed picked up extra points particularly given the drivers had discussed the penalty system with the race director on Friday of that weekend. The stewards seem to be quite harsh lately he said per Autosport. I dont feel like Ive been that dangerous over the last 12 months and it would be a shame to get a race ban for slowing down a bit too much behind the safety car and a couple of track limits this year. The penalty system was introduced after Romain Grosjean triggered several crashes in 2012 and 2013 for which he was branded a firstlap nutcase by Mark Webber. He was banned from a race in 2012 and the penalty points system was introduced in 2014 to create a formalised process to punish reckless driving. MORE MOTORSPORT GREATEST SPECTACLE IN THE WORLD Insane Vegas GP ticket prices revealed MOTOGP CHAMPIONSHIP Legends words of wisdom behind Bagnaias epic comeback But penalty points are increasingly dished out for minor racing offences or even just for exceeding track limits. While Gasly is a robust and aggressive driver it would be difficult to argue that hes dangerous or reckless. More than half the grid has four or more points. Only Lewis Hamilton and Carlos Sainz have clean sheets. Given the AlphaTauri driver has racked up 10 points in just 15 races the odds would seem stacked against him to avoid a ban before next May. Collecting his 12th penalty point in the seasonending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix would see him miss his debut race for Alpine next season. SKY SPORTS BOYCOTT TO END AFTER VERSTAPPEN SPAT Max Verstappen and Red Bull Racing will end their Sky Sports boycott this weekend following their media strike in Mexico. Last round Verstappen and his team snubbed interviews with all Sky Group broadcasters  Sky Sports UK Sky Sport Italia and Sky Sport Deutschland  following disrespectful remarks by pundit Ted Kravitz at the preceding race in the United States. Kravitz had said that Hamilton had been robbed of an eighth championship albeit in the context of the United States Grand Prix playing out as a movie script. But Red Bull Racing said this was merely the straw that broke the camels back having complained to Sky Sports UK several times about what it perceived to be Hamilton bias. Photo by Mark ThompsonGetty Images Source Getty Images Its been a constant kind of digging being disrespectful especially one particular person Verstappen said in Mexico. And at one point it is enough I dont accept it. You keep disrespecting me and at one point Im not tolerating it anymore. So thats why I decided to stop answering. Sky Sports UK is the de facto worldwide broadcaster being retransmitted to Australia Canada the United States and Ireland and used widely by F1 itself for highlights and other online content. Sky Sports and its sister Italian and German stations were able to take interviews conducted by F1 staff instead. ESPN has reported that Sky Sports F1 chief Billy McGinty travelled to Red Bull Racings Milton Keynes base earlier this week to clear the air and that the team has confirmed that it will stick by its original plan to resume interviews with the Sky Group broadcasters this weekend in Brazil.

We value our workers and do our best to get them paid as quickly as possible the company said in an email. The companys website does ask anyone with questions about getting paid from an event to submit a form on the website., AUSTIN KXAN  More than two weeks after Max Verstappen first crossed the finish line at Circuit of the Americas COTA some of the people working with a contractor at the Formula 1 Grand Prix race said they still havent been paid. Abigayle Winn said she was hired by MVP Event Staffing to do miscellaneous work during the race. She needed the cash to put towards grad school and was willing to put in three 15hour days to make it happen. But she said she and several other people she worked with havent gotten their paychecks yet. Winn is owed just south of 1000 she said. Thats like a little more than my monthly rent she said. I work full time during the week also so I had taken off of work Friday to do this. An online search of the company brings up other news stories from around the country of the same thing happening at other major events. KXAN reached out to MVP Event Staffing for answers. The company replied it has mailed over 250 checks from California and most have been delivered and cashed or deposited. We can assure you this is not a widespread issue. We value our workers and do our best to get them paid as quickly as possible the company said in an email. The companys website does ask anyone with questions about getting paid from an event to submit a form on the website. Winn has and still hasnt gotten a response. She also reached out to the contacts she was in touch with during the event. Her supervisor has disconnected her phone and her email bounced back Winn showed KXAN. I just hope that they pay everyone what theyre owed and stop responding and people are relying on this Winn said. Shes not alone Jenson Wenzel also worked with the same company and hasnt received his paycheck either which was promised to be delivered no later than Oct. 28. Wenzel is a teacher. I was working on the weekend just to get some extra help pay for my schooling so I can provide a better education for the kids I teach and for myself he said. The Circuit of the Americas and F1 did not respond to a request for comment. Meanwhile the Texas Workforce Commission said if people feel their rights under the Payday Law have been violated they should file a wage claim. However the TWC cant accept one if someone worked as an independent contractor and not an employee.

New to Kayo Start your free trial now  Racing down the famous Strip is an enormous coup in global sporting terms and shouldnt be understated. It was barely three years ago that F1 was still struggling to regain a foothold in the United States after more than a decade of fumbling. Next year one of the nations best known cities will close its best known street for a threeday car racing festival. F1 understands the significance of the achievement both for its own right and for brand value. In fact this is the first race of the modern era Formula 1 itself is running. Other grands prix pay for the privilege of hosting Formula 1 much like cities or countries bid competitively to host the Olympics or the FIFA World Cup. But to get the race off the ground in Las Vegas Formula 1 has made itself the promoter. Running the race will be done entirely in house. All the risks  the risks that came close to killing Silverstone last decade the risks that saw so many races in Asia drop off the calendar  will be borne by Formula 1. And as you can imagine that doesnt come cheaply. The sport hosted a glittering bigbudget launch party at the weekend to celebrate roughly one year to go before the first Las Vegas Grand Prix which will take place next year on 1618 November. At around the same time the tickets for the race went on sale to the general public with presale tickets having already been exhausted in the week leading up to the launch party. They sold out within minutes. That alone is remarkable but its doubly so when you consider the cost punters were willing to pay to attend the firstever race down the Strip. The cheapest general admission tickets started at US500 778 and got ticketholders threeday standingroom access near the back end of the circuit where track visibility is currently uncertain. If you wanted a seat the cheapest sold for 3112. A ticket to the grandstand on the front straight wouldve set you back a whopping 3890. Any fans still hoping to go will have to stump up for a VIP hospitality pass which are currently selling for 12090. There are also package resale deals available including from some of the hotels along the Strip. MGM bought 20 million worth of tickets ahead of time. Its bundling them in packages worth up to 155500. The Washington Post has reported some packages will cost up to 1.5 million. Hotel prices as you may have expected have also skyrocketed with MGM saying the price of a room at a Vegas hotel has risen by an average of 300 per cent for the grand prix weekend. Las Vegas TV station 8 News Now has reported some hotels have jacked up prices by as much as 678 per cent. Put simply this isnt a race for those faint of heart or light of wallet. HOW DOES IT COMPARE TO OTHER RACES A race in Las Vegas was always going to be eyewateringly expensive to attend and prospective racegoers even had warning via the ticket prices for the first Miami Grand Prix earlier this year. General admission tickets just for Sunday sold for 777 in Florida. The cheapest grandstand ticket was worth around 1000 and a ticket for a seat along the main straight cost a staggering 2613. Vegas and Miami are comfortably the most expensive ordinary tickets on the F1 calendar putting aside hospitality and VIP packages. For comparison even the United States Grand Prix in Austin  which has carved out a niche for itself as the hardcore F1 fans grand prix alongside its glitzier Miami and Vegas rivals  offered considerably cheaper prices. Getting a general admission ticket in Texas for the entire weekend cost around 500 this year. The cheapest bleacher seats cost 550 while tickets along the main straight start at 1126  less than half the cost of a similar seat in Miami and less than a third of the cost of the same in Vegas. Thats around par for the course on the grand prix tour. Silverstone charges similar prices over three days with general admission going for 562 the cheapest grandstand seats selling for 632 and a seat on the main straight starting at 1126. Monaco which is expected to increase ticket prices next year has sold twoday grandstand seats for around the 1000 mark depending on where exactly you were sitting. The Singapore Grand Prix originally billed as Asias answer to Monaco sold its cheapest grandstand for approximately 329 though the best seats would set you back around 1300. The Australian Grand Prix comes in very much at the cheaper end of the scale with fourday general admission selling for just 189 last year and the most expensive grandstand seats costing around 600. Thats not bad considering Melbourne is generally regarded by F1 as among the best run races on the calendar even considering Las Vegass flagship status. HOW CAN F1 CHARGE SO MUCH Formula 1s first major foray into event promotion hasnt resulted in some of the most expensive tickets in grand prix history by accident. The tickets were set at that level because the sport knew that theyd all sell. In fact most races this season were sold out. Even the Australian Grand Prix ran out of tickets and thats held in a giant park with virtually unlimited space for general admission. Formula 1 is experiencing a boom in popularity the likes of which its never seen before. Demand for the sport is extraordinarily high particularly in the United States. Consider this in 2019 the United States Grand Prix sold 268000 tickets across three days. This year it attracted a capacity 440000 people. Next year its targeting half a million spectators over three days which would eclipse the 520000 who turned up over four days to the final grand prix in Adelaide. Tickets for this years Austin race sold out in 24 hours. Tickets for the Miami Grand Prix sold out in 40 minutes. Local media reported all grandstand seats in Vegas sold out in minutes. The tickets were expensive but in this sentence were is the operative word. Clearly enough fans thought they were reasonably priced that theyre now all gone. Formula 1 has a certain positioning with regard to the kind of sport it is F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali told AP. We are going to deliver the greatest spectacle in the world as a statement of F1. That needs to be recognised and in terms of price positioning we are going to be on the top side because this is Las Vegas and that is the nature of the customer coming to Las Vegas. There will be possibilities for people who want to pay less to spend less. As always in life it is the market pulling the price and then on our side is the responsibility to bring a great event. The event has said more tickets will go on sale in the coming months. Were seeing tangible evidence of the reason Formula 1 is holding three grand prix in the United States next year bringing the total in North America to five alongside Canada and Mexico. Theres also clearly room for that footprint to grow. No two races in the United States are closer than 1700 kilometres from one another and the two closest races on the North American continent are more than 1200 kilometres apart. For reference the westernmost European race in Silverstone is less than 1500 kilometres from the easternmost race in Budapest between which there were another eight grands prix this year. The scales are completely different. North America has around 75 per cent of Europes population but will have only half as many grands prix. Races arent doled out based on population but with F1 enjoying an enormous popularity swing across the Atlantic theres a strong argument to be made that the continent can handle  and would indeed embrace  more than its currently been dealt Las Vegas might be over the top. Ticket prices might be embarrassingly high. The event might prove too tacky and not last beyond its threeyear contract. But as a crucial test of the depth of US interest its worked exactly as F1 wouldve hoped. The next question is how much deeper that interest is. And crucially what races will make way to expand F1s western horizon.
Lewis Hamilton at his 'other home': receives honorary Brazilian citizenship ahead of its Grand, https://www.marca.com/en/f1/2022/11/08/6369c40dca474177228b456c.html, In 2008 Lewis Hamilton won the first of his seven Formula 1 championships at the Brazilian Grand Prix. Last year after winning the Interlagos race it was said that the Brazilian government could grant him honorary citizenship which he has just received. That is why Congressman Andre Figueiredo proposed the initiative for Sir Lewis a Briton to receive the honorary citizenship. Hamilton went to Brazils Chamber of Deputies to receive his honorary citizenship. Hamilton attended the Las Vegas GP presentationJust last weekend Hamilton attended the Formula 1 presentation of what will be the Las Vegas Grand Prix which will be run for the first time next season., In 2008 Lewis Hamilton won the first of his seven Formula 1 championships at the Brazilian Grand Prix. Last year after winning the Interlagos race it was said that the Brazilian government could grant him honorary citizenship which he has just received. Hamilton is a big fan of Ayrton Senna the legendary Brazilian F1 pilot and when he won last year he held up the Brazilian flag as he stepped onto the podium. That is why Congressman Andre Figueiredo proposed the initiative for Sir Lewis a Briton to receive the honorary citizenship. Going for his fourth title in Brazil Hamilton has won the Brazilian GP three times 2016 2018 and 2021 and will seek his first victory of the season and fourth at the circuit next Sunday in what will be the penultimate race of the season which already has twotime champion in Dutchman Max Verstappen. Hamilton went to Brazils Chamber of Deputies to receive his honorary citizenship. I feel like I am now one of you said Lewis who came wearing a blue suit. At the ceremony he received Brazils legislative merit medal and a diploma and delivered a speech in which he thanked his fans and dedicated the honor to Senna. I have so many incredible memories of Brazil Hamilton said. And in particular from 2021. Knowing that you guys would cheer me on along the way was one of the most special moments of my entire life. Im looking forward to our continued efforts. Hamilton attended the Las Vegas GP presentation Just last weekend Hamilton attended the Formula 1 presentation of what will be the Las Vegas Grand Prix which will be run for the first time next season. At the event he was accompanied by his Mercedes teammate George Russell and Red Bulls Mexican Sergio Perez.
Verstappen doesn’t understand need for more F1 sprint races, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/verstappen-doesnt-understand-need-for-more-sprint-races-in-f1/10396150/, Listen to this articleF1 debuted its sprint race format at three races in 2021 before tweaking the format for this year including the return of designating pole to the driver who topped qualifying on Friday. The sprint race result then sets the final starting grid for Sundays race. Every time I do these sprint races its about dont get damage make sure you stay in the top three said Verstappen. I dont understand what the problem is for that because weve had so many exciting races so you dont need to add onethird of a race distance Verstappen said. It does create a few more options but sometimes theres no overtaking so we should hopefully learn from the races where theres been no overtaking in the sprint races., Listen to this article F1 debuted its sprint race format at three races in 2021 before tweaking the format for this year including the return of designating pole to the driver who topped qualifying on Friday. The sprint race result then sets the final starting grid for Sundays race. F1 will holds its final sprint of the 2022 season in Brazil this weekend ahead of expanding to six events next year which are still to be confirmed. But twotime world champion Verstappen said he enjoys the regular weekend format and that the risk of damaging the car or dropping to the rear of the field in the sprint races on Saturdays meant drivers tended to remain cautious. Every time I do these sprint races its about dont get damage make sure you stay in the top three said Verstappen. For me thats not really a race because you go into the main race and you know there are way more points available anyway you just risk a bit more there. You do another start which is exciting but its only really people who are out of position that move forward because only you put a tyre on that just lasts a whole stint and not much happens. Max Verstappen Red Bull Racing 1st position is interviewed in Parc Ferme Photo by Sam Bloxham  Motorsport Images Verstappen thought F1 should just stick to the main race instead of throwing an extra sprint into the weekend format. I dont understand what the problem is for that because weve had so many exciting races so you dont need to add onethird of a race distance Verstappen said. Everyone is so careful anyway because if you are fighting for third and you have a little touch and you drop to last you know your Sunday is going to be tough. Probably you wont risk it so thats not really a race. F1 teams have been supportive of the expansion of the sprint race format in 2023 which received approval from the FIA at the latest World Motor Sport Council meeting. This year saw sprints take place at Imola and the Red Bull Ring offering varying levels of ontrack action ahead of the grand prix on Sunday. Lewis Hamilton charged from last place on the grid to finish fourth in last years sprint race at Interlagos before going on to win the grand prix on Sunday. The Mercedes driver felt F1 had to be very selective where it held sprint races favouring tracks where overtaking was easier but he had liked the format because it was different. Weve had the same Thursday to Sunday for god knows how long said Hamilton. It was supposed to be a threeday weekend this year and then they changed it back to four day which I wasnt too happy about. The races are not always the greatest. It does create a few more options but sometimes theres no overtaking so we should hopefully learn from the races where theres been no overtaking in the sprint races. Putting them in places like Brazil that creates a lot of opportunity or somewhere like Baku is going to be the best places for overtaking. Im not against it. As long as theyre selective of where they put it.

Alpine: Austin F1 protest drew "line in the sand" for black-and-orange flag, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/alpine-austin-protest-black-orange-flag/10396196/, The stewards ultimately ruled in Alpines favour ensuring Alonso regained P7 in Austin but the case led to talks over the use of the blackandorange flag in F1 for minor damage. We had some very positive discussions yesterday with the FIA technical department and I think they agreed that things have gone a little bit too far said Permane. Im sure at the Technical Advisory Committee and the Sporting Advisory Committee those levels will discuss it more but a little bit of line in the sand has been drawn. This came after FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem requested a review into the use of the blackandorange flag in the wake of the Alonso incident and the subsequent protests. I think that also the FIA has to be a little bit more friendly to the teams., Listen to this article Alonso initially lost his seventhplace finish in the United States Grand Prix after Haas successfully lodged a protest claiming his car was unsafe due to a missing rear view mirror caused by the crash with Lance Stroll. The resulting 30second penalty dropped the Spaniard to 15th but Alpine lodged a counterprotest on the grounds Haas had submitted its initial protest too late. The stewards ultimately ruled in Alpines favour ensuring Alonso regained P7 in Austin but the case led to talks over the use of the blackandorange flag in F1 for minor damage. Haas initially lodged the protest in a bid for consistency having been forced to pit three times this season due to a loose front wing endplate that it claimed was still safe. Alpine sporting director Alan Permane welcomed the FIAs ruling and said he was encouraged by talks over what would be considered enough damage to warrant intervention. We had some very positive discussions yesterday with the FIA technical department and I think they agreed that things have gone a little bit too far said Permane. I dont think anyone maybe apart from Haas felt that having a mirror knocked off in an accident that wasnt your fault. And then that drive Fernando did he should have kept that seventh place. I think from here onwards small damages like a mirror like fromwing endplate if its nonstructural like a brake duct something like that will not be considered to be a blackandorange flag offence. Fernando Alonso Alpine A522 collides with Lance Stroll Aston Martin AMR22 Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images This is still ongoing. Im sure at the Technical Advisory Committee and the Sporting Advisory Committee those levels will discuss it more but a little bit of line in the sand has been drawn. Hopefully therell be better racing because of it. Permane said that FIA technical chiefs Jo Bauer and Nikolas Tombazis had specifically said that a blackandorange flag would no longer be used for a missing wing mirror something he said was sensible place. Motorsport.com reported last week that the FIA is set to reduce the amount it uses the blackandorange flag in races placing the onus on teams to ensure their cars are running in a safe manner. This came after FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem requested a review into the use of the blackandorange flag in the wake of the Alonso incident and the subsequent protests. There was some confusion over the action lodged by both Haas and Alpine after the race including concerns raised by the FIA stewards about race controls actions. AlphaTauri team principal Franz Tost felt the action was not managed in the best possible way and a little bit too chaotic but he hoped the teams could work with race control to better define what should be considered enough damage to make a car unsafe. I hope that we will not face this anymore in the future said Tost. I think that also the FIA has to be a little bit more friendly to the teams. He added I think that also the teams have to work together very closely with the FIA to sort out whether its dangerous to drive this car and safety is not any more respected and guaranteed.
How Formula 1 teams use the cloud to shave hundredths of a second off their lap times, https://fortune.com/2022/11/07/business-in-the-cloud-formula-one-f1-racing-teams/, Formula 1s openwheel singleseaters emit more than a million data points per second to the cloud. The figures collected from Formula 1s 10 teams over the season can generate more than 1 billion simulations that shape each teams raceweekend strategy. Prior to working with race cars KX focused on financial markets another arena where milliseconds matter. But raw data alone is not a magic bullet says Nathan Sykes the Alpine teams chief information officer. But countless simulations could not have foreseen that Strolls car would collide with Alonsos at turn 12 damaging both Alpine cars in one fell swoop., A dozen engineers in blue polo shirts emblazoned with the Alpine F1 Team logo glide across the garage at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin ready to race into the pit lane and change a smoking tire in two seconds flat. Others puzzle over computer monitors installed in the center of the garage. They along with 14 more sitting in a silent missioncontrollike room in the paddock are looking to minimize milliseconds as Alpines two drivers race around the track at 200 miles per hour. Formula 1s openwheel singleseaters emit more than a million data points per second to the cloud. From there the information is routed to the team garages as well as to scores of support staff across the Atlantic. On the 23rd lapwith 33 more to go during Octobers Formula 1 Grand Prixthe poloclad crew holds a collective breath watching Aston Martins Lance Stroll collide with Alpines Fernando Alonso. The crash sends Alonso airborne into a wall and generates enough debris to damage the front wing of the car behind himwhich happened to be helmed by Alpines other driver Esteban Ocon. Both Alpine drivers continued the courseto the amazement of spectatorsthanks to the copious data the cars generate in real time. Fernandos contact with the barrier was a big one but we were able to tell from the data that the suspension had not suffered any significant damage and was safe to continue Ciaron Pilbeam chief race engineer for the Alpine team tells Fortune. For Estebans car the data showed a small effect on performance but not enough to require changing the front wing at a pit stop which would have taken several seconds more than a normal pit stop. These days F1 teams use the cloud to shave hundredths of a second off their lap timesthe razorthin margin between winning and losing. Alpine French automaker Renaults sports car brand is an underdog team going all in on Moneyballstyle analytics this season to challenge the series reigning champs with blockbuster budgets such as Red Bull and MercedesBenz. Data can democratize the notoriously expensive sport for smallbudget teams that lack the funds for say the best and greatest wind tunnel according to Alpine CEO Laurent Rossi. Digitizing the research and development can level the playing field for teams previously at a disadvantage visvis the behemoths. Simulators are not capital intensive and much cheaper than physical testing Rossi says. Everyone can buy one. The datadriven approach has changed the sport dramatically over the past few years. The cars now contain more than 300 sensors measuring a wide range of inputs including temperature tire pressure and trajectory. The figures collected from Formula 1s 10 teams over the season can generate more than 1 billion simulations that shape each teams raceweekend strategy. The car is packed full of sensors because the difference between pole position and the back of the grid can be as little as 4 says Edward Green head of commercial technology for McLaren Racing. Its a sport of superfine margins and youve got to find any single way you can in order to gain an advantage. Just 25 years ago F1 cars recorded rudimentary data on floppy disks that the teams then mailed home for analysis. Now they use the cloud to capture 1.5 terabytes of data during the race weekend and transmit it across the world in near real time narrowing latency from a few days to mere milliseconds. That doesnt sound like a lot of time Green said. But in the world of Formula 1 a few milliseconds means a few meters on the track. The McLaren team uses Dells prototyping and simulation software as well as Ciscos Webex conference service to collaborate even when for example the engineers are in England the drivers are in Australia and the cars are in Canada. The 10 teams on the grid use a range of cloud technology providers. Red Bull uses Oracle Cloud software to analyze crucial decisions such as when to make a pit stop and which tires to use to clinch the teams firstplace finish in Austin. Ferraris F1 team works with Amazon Web Services which provides cloud computing and machine learning to run simulations and improve race day performance. Alpines software developer partner KX assimilates reams of data for review as the team treads the 23circuit season that stretches from Austin to Australia. On race day the data is shared and analyzed with another 60 engineers based at Alpines factory in Enstone U.K. and operations room in ViryChtillon France. Prior to working with race cars KX focused on financial markets another arena where milliseconds matter. Why reinvent the wheel Alpine executives thought when they could cut and paste from KXs experience helping highspeed traders gain a onesecond advantage over the competition But raw data alone is not a magic bullet says Nathan Sykes the Alpine teams chief information officer. The more data the cars generate the more challenging it is to organize especially when trying to account for what the other 19 cars on the track may do at any given time. The next frontier for Formula 1 he explains will be software that hones artificial intelligence to extract insight and make relevant inferences. The data is useless unless a team can unlock a competitive advantage through computer modeling. Its a lot of data to see through in order to get to what you want Sykes says. But countless simulations could not have foreseen that Strolls car would collide with Alonsos at turn 12 damaging both Alpine cars in one fell swoop. Alonso and Ocon went on to place seventh and 11th respectively out of 20 drivers. Data will probably give you the bulk of the performance you want to get Rossi says. And then there will be a bit of the human factor which is nice because its sports after all.
Stefano Domenicali: F1 open to talking to "credible" new Formula 1 team, https://www.planetf1.com/news/stefano-domenicali-credible-new-team/, Formula 1 CEO Stefano Domenicali has said F1 is willing to discuss a potential entry to the championship from a credible new entry. After years of will they wont they the VW Group has finally committed to an F1 entry as the Audi brand enters the sport in 2026 in partnership with the Sauber team. However Domenicali said there would need to be extensive conversations if a new entrant was to come along. I think the first thing we need to consider is whether this eventual possibility will bring extra value to the championship. But mainly the point is that eventually a new entry will bring a better position for the F1 Championship., Formula 1 CEO Stefano Domenicali has said F1 is willing to discuss a potential entry to the championship from a credible new entry. Domenicali suggested the sport is ready to listen to proposals from an interested team should a new entrant be looking to enter the championship but insisted the sport is in no hurry to do so. The last new team to enter the sport was Haas in 2016 with the previous new entrants being the trio of backmarker teams Caterham Virgin and HRT in 2010 all now defunct. With the sports popularity booming rumours of interested parties have surfaced. After years of will they wont they the VW Group has finally committed to an F1 entry as the Audi brand enters the sport in 2026 in partnership with the Sauber team. However Domenicali said there would need to be extensive conversations if a new entrant was to come along. With regard to the value or process related to the possibility of an F1 team to be introduced into the championship of course that is the primary step both us and the FIA have to be in agreement for that Domenicali said in a recent investors call for Liberty Media. I think the first thing we need to consider is whether this eventual possibility will bring extra value to the championship. If so of course we will discuss it internally. We will see if it is any kind of real potential for a new new entry to give the benefit for the value of the championship. On top of it there is a value that has to be recognised to the teams that are already in the championship because of course they cannot allow any dilution of their financial partnership with the F1 Championship. This is what is written in the Concorde Agreement. But mainly the point is that eventually a new entry will bring a better position for the F1 Championship. This is really an integral value in terms of value from the financial point of view and in terms of value from the sporting point of view. It is not a problem to do I think one more team to have better racing. Therefore we will see  we will monitor the situation. It would be a real credible new entry that wants to discuss with us. We are ready to discuss but we are not in a rushed position today for that. Do Stefano Domenicalis comments quash Andretti efforts Domenicalis comments suggest F1 does not view the efforts of the Andretti Group as credible as the behemoths of American motorsport seek an entry into the championship for 2024. Led by former McLaren F1 driver Michael Andretti the organisation have begun building a new home for the Andretti umbrella of racing teams  the facility being kitted out to potentially home an F1 entry as well. Andretti have met with resistance from the F1 world with 1978 Formula 1 World Champion Mario Andretti father of Michael viewing the treatment of his outfit as disrespect from the paddock. Speaking in a recent exclusive interview with PlanetF1 Andretti said the team are working full steam ahead on an F1 entry and are doing so as if F1 has already given them the nod to enter the championship for 2024.

Currently the sport has a compulsory twoweek break during the summer to protect the wellbeing of the teams personnel. With the F1 calendar expanding to 24 races for next season there are concerns that the schedule could become too intense for employees working in F1. Mercedes Team Principal Toto Wolff pledged his support to the idea and believed that this seasons earlier finish  due to the World Cup being played in winter  will help his staff but also called for an agreement to a winter shutdown. I think its great that the season finishes this couple of weeks earlier than in the past because everyone is really in the limit Wolff told media including RacingNews365.com. I think we plan to introduce a shutdown in the coming year. Not everybody is in agreement but I would very much hope that we can do that for our staff and having this one week or two weeks more is definitely a nice welcome. For the race team thats clocking many airline miles thats a positive.
Pulling focus: Hollywood sets its sights on Formula 1, https://f1i.com/magazine/459594-pulling-focus-hollywood-sets-its-sights-on-formula-1.html, Pitt himself is certainly no opportunistic latecomer to the appeal of motorsport having waved the flag to get the 24 Hours of Le Mans underway in 2016. Worryingly leaks of the early draft script for this new F1 movie suggest a very similar storyline with 58yearold Pitt taking the role of the veteran. The 24 Hours of Le Mans was the focus in one of the most pure racing films of all time Steve McQueens 1971 contribution titled simply Le Mans. More recently the race has been the backdrop for Ford vs Ferrari retitled Le Mans 66 in Europe starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale and directed by James Mangold. When they visited Austin the production team showed team principals a sample of the cutting edge technology used to such success in Top Gun Maverick to seamlessly blend real footage with CGI., Hollywoods relationship with Formula 1 has been a patchy one at best over the years but is that about to change with Brad Pitts new movie coproduced by seventime world champion Lewis Hamilton When a Hollywood Alister like Brad Pitt heads into town to watch a Grand Prix from the pit wall you know that Formula 1 is taking the entertainment industry and America as a whole by storm. If any further evidence were needed then you have this weekends glitzy starpacked showbiz launch for the Las Vegas GP that will be on the calendar in 2023. Much of the surge in global popularity of F1 stems from the Netflix behindthescenes documentary Drive to Survive so it shouldnt be a big surprise that the big screen boys also want in on the action. The presence of Pitt and his handson involvement in a major forthcoming production speaks volumes about the intentions of legendary producer Jerry Bruckheimer and his team. Pitt himself is certainly no opportunistic latecomer to the appeal of motorsport having waved the flag to get the 24 Hours of Le Mans underway in 2016. However its arguably Lewis Hamiltons personal involvement in the film that helped get the ball rolling on this particular production. One of the 21st centurys most successful drivers Hamilton created his own production company with his business partner and manager Penni Thow called Dawn Apollo Films to facilitate development and he will take a coproducer credit on the finished movie. The Britons company also has in its pipeline a feature documentary that will chronicle Hamiltons own journey with production scheduled to start next year. Regarding the Pitt project the script by Top Gun Maverick writer Ehren Kruger is still in the early stages and no title has been decided for the film which has been acquired for distribution by Apple Screen and will be broadcast on the Apple TV streaming service. Apple CEO Tim Cook even joined Pitt at the Circuit of the Americas and was invited to wave the chequered flag somewhat gingerly at the end of last months United States GP. Also present was director Joe Kosinski who previously helmed the Top Gun sequel which displayed his mastery of interweaving spectacular special effects with genuine footage of fighter planes in action. The plan is for the new movie to do the same for motorsport and its why the Hollywood team was in Austin to get a real feel for the visceral nature of F1 and get some idea of how to convey that on the big screen in a way never before possible. The granddaddy of F1 movies is John Frankenheimers 1966 epic Grand Prix starring James Garner and Yves Montand while 1976s littleremembered Bobby Deerfield starring Al Pacino was shot at the Spanish Grand Prix and heroes the Brabham team thenowned by Bernie Ecclestone. More recently Ron Howards 2013 film Rush written by Peter Morgan about the Niki LaudaJames Hunt battle for the 1976 world championship was well received but only did modest box office business. Good as they were in many ways none of the films managed to truly evoke the thrills of watching live television coverage of actual races. But looming over any film about motorsport is the spectre of 2001s Driven starring Sylvester Stallone and directed by Renny Harlin. It started as a film set in the world of F1 but Ecclestone got a bad feeling about the way it was going and pulled his support forcing the film to relocate to the paddock of the US open wheel single seater CART series instead. Calling the end product a cartoon would be an understatement and an insult to the noble art of animation while we wouldnt wish to imply any cause and effect CART itself want out of business two years after the universally derided movie premiered. The plot of Driven featured Stallone as a veteran driver coming out of retirement to help a young new driver competing for the championship framing a battle of the generations. Worryingly leaks of the early draft script for this new F1 movie suggest a very similar storyline with 58yearold Pitt taking the role of the veteran. Despite his Peter Pan eternally youthful looks it would surely stretch credulity to breaking point to have him in the cockpit of a car on the grid for the start of a Grand Prix. After the car crash of Driven Ecclestone remained sceptical of entrusting F1 to filmmakers and held them at arms length. The lack of interest in F1 in the US was another factor with Tom Cruise turning to the more popular domestic NASCAR stock car series for the setting of 1990s Days of Thunder. However Ecclestone did give unprecedented access to F1s media archives to help director Asif Kapadia make the brilliant 2010 documentary Senna arguably one of the best films fact or fiction ever made about F1. Its only since Ecclestone has moved on and F1 is now owned by Liberty Media that the situation has changed and F1 is opening its doors to the filmmakers once more. In the meantime other areas of motor sport have been more welcoming to the cameras. The 24 Hours of Le Mans was the focus in one of the most pure racing films of all time Steve McQueens 1971 contribution titled simply Le Mans. More recently the race has been the backdrop for Ford vs Ferrari retitled Le Mans 66 in Europe starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale and directed by James Mangold. And then theres Ferrari a new Michael Mann film already in production for release in 2023 charting the life and success of iconic motorsports pioneer Enzo Ferrari who will be played by Star Wars star Adam Driver with Penlope Cruz as his wife Laura. With rumours of another potential film set in Le Mans circulating ahead of the 100th anniversary of the first race there it seems that the film business has finally got a long overdue taste for putting motor racing back on the big screen. In fact you might even say its getting a bit crowded out there. So what will the PittHamilton film do differently Its biggest selling point would appear to be total authenticity and realism putting it a world away from the lamentable Driven. Principal photography is expected to take place in 2023 with the production being given wideranging access to all parts of the paddock on specific race weekends. That effectively rules out any significant acting role for Hamilton who is focussed on extending his racing career with Mercedes meaning that he will be otherwise engaged. But just as happened in the original Grand Prix movie with contemporary stars like Graham Hill you can expect Hamilton and many of his peers to pop up in the back of shot and maybe even speak a line or two. Place your bets on who among them will be the best actor  and who will be painfully wooden After that will come an extensive postproduction phase. When they visited Austin the production team showed team principals a sample of the cutting edge technology used to such success in Top Gun Maverick to seamlessly blend real footage with CGI. The idea is to capture that world in the most authentic way possible director Kosinski told The Playlist at the time. To shoot real cars in real races and really give the audience the sensation of what its like to be in one of those cars. The film is expected to have a scheduled release in 2024. The fact that motor racing in general  and F1 in particular  is now considered to be so bankable by major Hollywood studios and Alist stars says a huge amount about the robust state of health of the sport across the Atlantic and around the world. Lets just hope it manages to ride the wave and match up to the international popular and critical success of Drive to Survive rather than following Driven by crashing into the barriers at the first corner.

There should he take part in this weekends main race at Interlagos after its sprint event Vettel will make his 299th and last F1 grand prix start. After his decision to retire was announced ahead of this years Hungarian GP Vettels final races have become a farewell tour with Fernando Alonso signed up to replace him at Aston alongside Lance Stroll for 2023. Those events have corresponded with an upturn in Astons form with its steady upgrade plan since its big Spanish GP update changed the look of the AMR22 helping the team move from ninth to seventh in the constructors championship. When asked by Motorsport.com how much he was still working with Aston as it looks to implement the lessons learned from its current package heading into the second year of F1s new ground effect era Vettel said he was assisting the green team with everything I have. I have no reason to hold back anything he continued. Im not changing Im not going anywhere so I say what I think. Nothing has changed compared to say last year. Drivers leaving teams are typically frozen out of car development work in case they take information with them to new F1 homes. Although Vettel who was speaking at the recent US GP said he was not really involved in direct talks with Astons engineers about its 2023 design he clarified this meant the team knows the weaknesses of this year and obviously is trying to fix them for next year. Sebastian Vettel Aston Martin on the grid Photo by Zak Mauger  Motorsport Images This means he can answer yes and I could answer no when it comes to addressing problems on the AMR22 that may only be cured with the new design coming for 2023. Although it was off the pace with its downforce deficit and added problems managing tyre life and brake temperatures last time out in Mexico Vettels races in Singapore Japan and the USA were among the best he has produced all year. Only a botched Austin pitstop dropped him from a potential podium battle and led to his thrilling lastlap fightback pass on Haas driver Kevin Magnussen. In Mexico Vettel was asked if such performances meant he might be reconsidering stopping  a suggestion the fourtime world champion rebuffed. I thought about this decision long and hard and from a lot of angles he explained. I find its a bit sad that we tend to swing so much now regarding analysis of form. I see the benefits of having emotions running high and low rather than just being flat but I think the judging in general its a bit too quick. We create a hype and too quickly we create like a massive  I dont want to say disappointment and not because of my situation now the last races versus maybe the mid part of the season  so its more of a general thing. But yeah I obviously enjoyed the last two races last couple of races more than I did maybe some in the midpart of the season but they have no impact on the decision. And if anything its a great reminder of why I love this sport so much why I love racing so much. I had great races and I really enjoyed them but I also had races that I didnt enjoy so much and I was wishing after five laps to see the chequered flag and it didnt come out. So you still have to find the motivation in that and hang in there. But yeah I wish that sometimes it just wouldnt swing as high and as low.

Primary F1 revenue represents the majority of F1s revenue and is derived from race promotion revenue media rights fees and sponsorship fees. There were seven races held in the third quarters of both 2022 and 2021. There are 22 events scheduled for the 2022 race calendar. Throughout 2021 and particularly in the first half of the season attendance at races was limited due to the pandemic. Restrictions on fan attendance reduced as 2021 progressed with all races in the second half of the year operating at either full capacity or with fewer restrictions. The Paddock Club resumed normal operations beginning with the Austrian Grand Prix on July 4 2021.

Primary F1 revenue increased in the third quarter with growth across media rights and sponsorship partially offset by a decline in race promotion revenue. Race promotion revenue decreased due to lower fees generated from the different mix of events held with one additional race held outside of Europe in the prior year period. Media rights increased due to growth in F1TV subscription revenue and increased fees Under new and renewed contractual agreements and sponsorship revenue increased due to the recognition of revenue from new sponsors. Other F1 revenue increased in the third quarter primarily due to higher hospitality revenue generated from the Paddock Club which operated at one additional race in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the prior year period and has seen record attendance yeartodate. Cost of F1 revenue increased compared to the prior year due to the pro rata recognition of increased team payments. Other cost of F1 revenue is largely variable in nature and mostly relates to revenue opportunities. These costs increased in the third quarter driven by the costs of higher hospitality attendance in the Paddock Club and one additional Paddock Club event operated compared to the prior year period. In addition other cost of F1 revenue grew due to higher commissions and partner servicing costs associated with the Primary F1 revenue streams and higher Formula 2 and Formula 3 related costs. Selling general and administrative expense increased in the third quarter due to higher personnel and IT costs and increased legal and other advisory fees.

Wolff: Mercedes lost 8-10 months of development curing ‘22 car problem, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/wolff-mercedes-lost-8-10-months-of-development-curing-22-car-problem/10396298/, Listen to this articleThe German car manufacturer has endured a tricky season with the W13 which suffered a lot early on from excessive bouncing. Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff reckons that his squad is still playing catchup now which will not make it easy to be back in the hunt for victories from the start of 2023. They will carry over some of their sweetness in the car and weve maybe lost eight to 10 months in terms of development because we couldnt figure out what was wrong. In terms of relative to Red Bull they still hold the edge relative to us. And when you have a car within a few tenths of your competition you can make things happen., Listen to this article The German car manufacturer has endured a tricky season with the W13 which suffered a lot early on from excessive bouncing. It took several months for Mercedes to understand the factors that were at play and implement car tweaks that have helped Lewis Hamilton and George Russell make some progress over the second half of the campaign. But while it was able to get on top of the porpoising its chances of beating Red Bull for a race win have not been helped by the fact its car is still lacking a bit of pace. The team was also hurt by not being able to work on performance upgrades until it had cured its issues meaning it fell away from the frontrunners. Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff reckons that his squad is still playing catchup now which will not make it easy to be back in the hunt for victories from the start of 2023. We believe that we understand where the gap comes from he said when asked if he felt that Red Bulls early advantage with F1s new 2022 rules would put it in good stead for years to come. They will carry over some of their sweetness in the car and weve maybe lost eight to 10 months in terms of development because we couldnt figure out what was wrong. So theres definitely a challenge. But were playing the long game here all of us. Both drivers are playing the long game the team. The judge around the team of performance is not based on a single year or weekend. Its how we have been able to win championships over the long term. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes W13 Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images Mercedes has emerged as Red Bulls main threat in recent races as Ferrari has endured two difficult weekends in the United States and Mexico. However as it chases its first win of 2022 Mercedes thinks that things will return to being a threeway fight for the final two races even though Red Bull still appears to have an edge. Chief strategist James Vowles said Ferrari wont be that far back and away from us as they were in Mexico. They will be closer in Brazil and Abu Dhabi and it will be a very close fight between our two teams. In terms of relative to Red Bull they still hold the edge relative to us. I dont think it is quite the three tenths they outqualified us by in Mexico but it will be a few tenths across the next few races. We are getting closer and closer compared to where we were at the beginning of the season where at times we were struggling to get out of Q1 or into Q3 to where we are now which is we are within a whisker of fighting for our first win. We have moved forward. In Brazil its a track that both of our drivers have typically gone well at and it is a sprint race where we can pick up more points. And when you have a car within a few tenths of your competition you can make things happen.
Red Bull predicts several teams to break 2022 cost cap, https://racingnews365.com/marko-expects-several-teams-to-break-2022-cost-cap, Red Bull believe that up to six teams are projected to exceed the 2022 cost cap limit. It was believed that the drama surrounding the cost cap breach would be enough to deter others from a similar offence. Horner Red Bull not at risk of 2022 breach Earlier in the season Red Bull were one of the teams to take issue with the 2022 cost cap which had been reduced from 145 million to 140 million. With that in mind given the penalty Red Bull received for their overspend of the 2021 budget cap Horner questions what could be levied if teams go over the cap by more. We do not believe that we will break the cap in 2022 but these penalties set a precedent for the future., Red Bull believe that up to six teams are projected to exceed the 2022 cost cap limit. The Milton Keynes team were recently found guilty of exceeding the F1 spending cap of 145 million for the 2021 season with the team fined 7 million and handed testing limitations. It was believed that the drama surrounding the cost cap breach would be enough to deter others from a similar offence. However Red Bull Motorsport Advisor Helmut Marko believes that several F1 teams are already at risk of a financial breach citing inflation and energy costs as the main reasons. I think the current situation is that six teams are above it Marko told Auto Motor Und Sport. Inflation is something that was not calculable to that extent. Especially with energy costs. Horner Red Bull not at risk of 2022 breach Earlier in the season Red Bull were one of the teams to take issue with the 2022 cost cap which had been reduced from 145 million to 140 million. They along with the likes of Mercedes and Ferrari believed that extra allowances needed to be made for the rise in inflation and energy costs seen across much of Europe. A budget cap increase of 3.1 was permitted with the support of F1 the FIA and nine of the 10 teams however Red Bull Team Principal Christian Horner still believes there will be teams in breach given the market fluctuations. The danger for 2022 is that there could be six teams in breach of the cap. Energy prices have been exponential Horner told media including RacingNews365.com. There is that chance that several teams many of which have stated it during Formula One commission meetings will break the cap this year. With that in mind given the penalty Red Bull received for their overspend of the 2021 budget cap Horner questions what could be levied if teams go over the cap by more. We do not believe that we will break the cap in 2022 but these penalties set a precedent for the future. So if you get 10 for 0.3 breach what is the 5 Breach going to look like

Return of the Sprint and Mercedes closing on Ferrari – 5 storylines we’re excited about ahead of the Sao Paulo GP, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.return-of-the-sprint-and-mercedes-closing-on-ferrari-5-storylines-were.58js9Y0grbbUkWQvFaQLFD.html, So here are a few of the topics that we think will be doing the rounds when the paddock reconvenes in Sao Paulo 1. And that has also opened the door for Mercedes to put some unexpected pressure on the Scuderia. Mercedes are putting pressure on Ferrari as the season enters its closing stages3. It remains to be seen where Ricciardo will land for 2023 amid talk of a Mercedes reserve role4. The battle for P4 between Alpine and McLaren looks set to go down to the wire, There are just two race weekends to go in 2022 and the first one promises extra action as the Sprint makes its final appearance of the year at one of Formula 1s iconic circuits. So here are a few of the topics that we think will be doing the rounds when the paddock reconvenes in Sao Paulo 1. The final Sprint of 2022 We might be getting towards the end of the 2022 season but as we enter the final doubleheader of the year there are going to be even more competitive sessions in Brazil as the third Sprint of the season is here this weekend. After exciting events at Imola and the Red Bull Ring earlier this year theres plenty to play for at Interlagos as qualifying takes place on Friday afternoon after just one practice session remember to set the grid for Saturdays Sprint and then the finishing order from that Sprint will decide the starting lineup for the Grand Prix itself. READ MORE I never thought Id be able to win 14 races in a year says recordbreaker Verstappen in Mexico And in that Grand Prix Max Verstappen will be looking to extend some of the records he set in Mexico. The first being the number of victories in a season having moved clear of Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel with his 14th win in Mexico City but the other being the most points scored in a season  a record he could push even further in the Sprint as up to eight points are on offer in the Saturday event. Verstappen has won 14 of the 20 Grands Prix held so far this season 2. Mercedes closing on Ferrari Verstappen might be going in search of another victory in his recordbreaking season but he does so safe in the knowledge that he is guaranteed to finish the year as champion just as Red Bull will in the constructors standings. But behind them theres still a lot at stake. Sergio Perez moved just five points ahead of Charles Leclerc in the battle for second in the drivers championship in Mexico a result that came about with Perez finishing third and Leclerc a distant sixth as Ferrari had a tough weekend. And that has also opened the door for Mercedes to put some unexpected pressure on the Scuderia. TREMAYNE Mercedes resurgence means we could be in for a thrilling end to 2022 Mercedes started this season a long way off the top two teams but have been improving their car as the year has progressed with both Lewis Hamilton and George Russell a threat for pole in Mexico. That came after Hamilton had nearly won in Austin and another second place  paired with Russells P4 finish  means they are now just 40 points behind Ferrari with the two races remaining. It would still take a pretty major turnaround for Mercedes to overhaul Mattia Binottos team but if they enjoy a similar pace advantage to Mexico  where Ferrari struggled with power unit performance and the cars handling  then the Sprint provides two opportunities to close the gap. Mercedes are putting pressure on Ferrari as the season enters its closing stages 3. Undecided futures for Ricciardo and Haas It wasnt just Mercedes who were able to enjoy an encouraging weekend at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez last time out with Daniel Ricciardo on fine form as he negated a 10second time penalty for causing a collision with Yuki Tsunoda to finish seventh. Ricciardo carved through the field to end up best of the rest behind the top three teams in the sort of performance we were accustomed to seeing before his McLaren spell and it serves as a reminder of his talent. But the Australian says he wont be on the grid next season while he insists he is still yet to officially decide what his future holds. The smart money is on a Mercedes reserve role especially after current reserve Stoffel Vandoorne was confirmed as joining Aston Martin next year following Nyck de Vries in moving on from that position and leaving a vacancy at the Silver Arrows. READ MORE Ricciardo insists new Hamilton contract wouldnt affect his F1 future as he aims to come back with a vengeance in 2024 Ricciardo isnt the only driver with intrigue surrounding his future with two rounds to go though as Haas have yet to confirm who will be in their second car alongside Kevin Magnussen next year. It appears to be a straight choice between Mick Schumacher and Nico Hulkenberg with the latter not mentioned as part of the Aston Martin setup in its announcement of Vandoorne. If either situation is going to be resolved before the season ends then were likely to hear about it over the coming 14 days. It remains to be seen where Ricciardo will land for 2023 amid talk of a Mercedes reserve role 4. The midfield fight hotting up Haas are just holding on to eighth in the constructors championship by one point over AlphaTauri and while the gaps ahead of them are slightly bigger they are between teams who seem capable of scoring more heavily in the second half of the season.

I think he has proven that hes definitely not lifted his foot off the throttle pedal and hes definitely the last few races performing probably better than ever., Dutch racing driver Tom Coronel claims Max Verstappen will be looking forward to Lewis Hamiltons rumored contract extension with Mercedes. The Dutch driver lauded the two for their brilliant and fierce ontrack battles leading to the growth of the sport in recent years. Lewis Hamiltons F1 contract is set to expire at the end of 2023 but the world champion has claimed he wants to stick with Mercedes for a while longer. The Briton is desperately trying to win an eighth world championship which will put him above Michael Schumacher for the most number of titles won by a single person in the sport. An extended stay in the sport however will lead to more frequent battles with his 2021 title rival Max Verstappen who recently took his second title win in the sport. Dutch racing driver Tom Coronel told the RN365 F1 podcast that he hopes Hamilton stays in the sport so that he can battle with Verstappen in the coming years. He also claims the 2022 F1 world champion probably feels the same way. Coronel said Thats cool to look at. Let them fight it out on the track not off the court. Then I just keep finding it neat. Outside the job people are going to interfere with it or at least stoke a bit. We shouldnt do that and Max doesnt want that. He just says come on the track and Ill eat you up. George Russell also looks forward to Lewis Hamiltons contract extension George Russell is excited to race Lewis Hamilton in the future as the Briton announced that he will be extending his contract. The Mercedes driver is looking forward to battling the seventime world champion for years to come. deni fiagirly F1  George Russell on Lewis Hamilton Its really exciting to have Lewis staying on for a number of years to come.

F1 George Russell on Lewis Hamilton Its really exciting to have Lewis staying on for a number of years to come. I think he has proven that hes definitely not lifted his foot off the throttle pedal and hes definitely the last few races performing probably better than ever. Commenting on the Mercedes champions contract extension Russell said Yeah its really exciting to have that potential of Lewis staying on for a number of years to come. I think he has proven that hes definitely not lifted his foot off the throttle pedal and hes definitely the last few races performing probably better than ever. And thats really exciting for me to have the opportunity to be his teammate to go directly headtohead with him and grow on this journey that were on together because it really does feel like a journey that the two of us are on along with the rest of the team in trying to bring Mercedes back to winning ways. So yeah I think weve got a really really great relationship transparent relationship and yeah be great to be teammates for a number of years to come. Russell currently leads Lewis Hamilton by 15 points in the drivers standings. With the seventime world champion in better form than the former Williams driver at the moment however Russell is going to have to watch his back if he wants to make sure his teammate doesnt get the best of him in 2022.

George Russell confident of Mercedes having 'a more complete car' for 2023 F1 season, https://www.sportskeeda.com/f1/news-george-russell-confident-mercedes-a-complete-car-2023-f1-season, George Russell is confident that Mercedes will have a more competitive car from the getgo in 2023. The Briton claims the German team will implement a new philosophy in terms of car development that will help them fight for wins and titles once again. Im confident. Of course we dont know what the other teams can find in the winter but Im confident that we will have a more complete car in 2023. We know ourselves that we stopped quite early with the development of the car focusing on 2023., George Russell is confident that Mercedes will have a more competitive car from the getgo in 2023. The Briton claims the German team will implement a new philosophy in terms of car development that will help them fight for wins and titles once again. 2022 hasnt gone the Silver Arrows way with the Brackleybased team having struggled compared to Red Bull and Ferrari since the very start of the season. Lewis Hamilton and George Russells ubersuccessful team however has been making something of a comeback in recent races with the team coming closer and closer to that everelusive first win. Consequently Russell is confident in his teams ability to bounce back given their improving form. He told Sky We have a philosophy that we are going to implement in the development of the car. Im pretty sure its the right philosophy but it doesnt necessarily mean were going to get everything. We have a goal and that is already very positive. We are hunting for the top teams ed. and we have a clear goal. Can we achieve that goal Im confident. Of course we dont know what the other teams can find in the winter but Im confident that we will have a more complete car in 2023. Ferrari isnt bothered by Mercedes return to form in 2022 Ferrari boss Mattia Binotto claims his team is not too concerned by the Silver Arrows return to form in recent races. The Italian boss claims his teams dropping gap to the German team is due to the continued development of their challenger as opposed to the Scuderias focus on the 2023 F1 season. Binotto claims Ferraris focus has almost entirely shifted to the 2023 season where they will try and challenge Max Verstappen and Red Bull once again. In doing so Mercedes have found themselves only 40points behind the Maranellobased team after the 2022 F1 Mexican GP. Binotto told the media Mercedes are coming back as they have developed the car more than we did. We know ourselves that we stopped quite early with the development of the car focusing on 2023. So somehow Im not too concerned by the rate of development because I know when we stopped developing our own car. With only two races to go in 2022 the battle for P2 in the constructors championship between Ferrari and Mercedes is likely to go down to the wire. With the twisty highdownforce Interlagos circuit up next both teams can hope to pip their rivals next weekend. Poll  0 votes

Daniel Ricciardo Says The F1 Fanbase Has Changed 'Massively' Since Drive To Survive, https://wtf1.com/post/daniel-ricciardo-says-the-f1-fanbase-has-changed-massively-since-drive-to-survive/, Even if you were an F1 fan before the series existed if you havent watched Drive To Survive where have you been Its no secret that Drive To Survive has played a massive role in expanding the sports reach across the globe particularly in America. On a podcast with YMH Studios Daniel Ricciardo was asked whether the Netflix series had changed the F1 fanbase. Massively he says It really has changed like drastically since the series because it was a very like niche group of followers. Do you think Drive To Survive has had a positive effect on F1, Even if you were an F1 fan before the series existed if you havent watched Drive To Survive where have you been The series debuted in 2019 and became an instant hit giving us insights into the world of F1 with its somewhat overdramatised rivalries and cutthroat business decisions. Oh so much drama. Think Keeping Up With The Kardashians but make it F1. Its no secret that Drive To Survive has played a massive role in expanding the sports reach across the globe particularly in America. It has had its fair share of criticism too with some drivers  including world champion Max Verstappen  having concerns about how the sport is being presented in a much more dramatic way than it is. But you cant deny that the show has had an incredible effect on bringing new fans into F1. On a podcast with YMH Studios Daniel Ricciardo was asked whether the Netflix series had changed the F1 fanbase. Massively he says It really has changed like drastically since the series because it was a very like niche group of followers. F1 is some peoples life and its the only sport they love and all theyre into. It wasnt very accessible for many years and especially because of even the simple fact we wear helmets  like you couldnt really put a face to a name. With race attendance at an alltime high and tickets for the 2023 races selling out before you can say the word motorsport its clear Drive To Survive has made its mark.

F1 in Las Vegas: Race will be most expensive on 2023 schedule, https://www.fox5vegas.com/2022/11/07/f1-las-vegas-race-will-be-most-expensive-2023-schedule/, Las Vegas next year will make it three U.S. stops and five North American stops total with Montreal and Mexico City. There was some sticker shock surrounding the pricing at the inaugural Miami Grand Prix and Las Vegas is going to cost even more. It will also be the most expensive race in terms of costs Maffei added. But the Launch Party is a sampling of what F1 believes can do to make next years Las Vegas race worth the price of admission. What we want to create is to have different races with different personality with different characteristics with different fans with different price points with different expectations Domenicali said., AP  Formula One took its globehoping extravaganza to the Las Vegas Strip on Saturday for an official launch party on what it believes will be one of the biggest sporting events in the world. The most expensive too. F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali told The Associated Press the Las Vegas Grand Prix will be the most expensive fan experience on next years 24race calendar particularly from a VIP experience. Tickets were scheduled to go on sale late Saturday night with the price of admission starting at 500 for a threeday general admission pass. Those seats were only added after fans complained that hotels planned to purchase massive ticket blocks and repackage them into entertainment experiences ranging from 100000 to 1 million. But ahead of tickets going on sale seats in the grandstands started at 2500 and the only hospitality package with a price was listed for 10000. Formula One has a certain positioning with regard to the kind of sport it is Domenicali told The AP. We are going to deliver the greatest spectacle in the world as a statement of F1. That needs to be recognized and in terms of price positioning we are going to be on the top side because this is Las Vegas and that is the nature of the customer coming to Las Vegas. There will be possibilities for people who want to pay less to spend less. As always in life it is the market pulling the price and then on our side is the responsibility to bring a great event. Based on an explosion in popularity in the United States created by the behindthescenes Netflix docudrama Drive to Survive F1 in May made Miami its second annual race in the country. Las Vegas next year will make it three U.S. stops and five North American stops total with Montreal and Mexico City. There was some sticker shock surrounding the pricing at the inaugural Miami Grand Prix and Las Vegas is going to cost even more. F1 owned by U.S.based Liberty Media will be a firsttime promoter for the Nov. 18 night race that will use famous Vegas landmarks and rush down the Strip. Liberty Media earlier this year purchased a 39acre strip for 240 million for the construction of pit lanes paddocks and hospitality and CEO Greg Maffei on Saturday said the costs of putting on such a spectacle in a showplace city is evident in ticket prices. Given it is our race as a promoter we want to make it a showcase of what can be done at all the races. We want to capitalize on the fan interest which is enormous in the U.S. the demand is massive Maffei told AP and predicted tickets would sell out within hours. Both for us as a company this will be the largest race in terms of revenues. It will also be the most expensive race in terms of costs Maffei added. Thats just the nature of the event the scale and the nature of Vegas. We will try to create economic choices for fans not all fans can pay the top dollar we understand. This is an expensive place to operate and well try to take advantage of the great things Vegas has to offer. The glitz and glamour that F1 has in mind was showcased at Saturdays launch party. Seventime champion Lewis Hamilton and fellow drivers Sergio Perez and Alex Albon were brought in for a demonstration run of their F1 cars on the Strip and Albon said hes the one strangers have been approaching saying Youre that Netflix guy. They dont even know my name. Perez told The AP he expected the Las Vegas race to be the biggest sporting event in the world next year and Haas team boss Guenther Steiner couldnt believe the event was even happening. He said when he heard about Las Vegas he thought really on the Strip. How are we going to race cars here But Vegas can make it happen. The Launch Party actually started earlier this week when an F1 car drove down the casino floor of The Wynn and Saturday included a full day of events that included a pit stop challenge driver appearances a drone show above Caesars Palace and a VIP afterparty with Swedish DJ Alesso at a threelevel nightclub inside Caesars. During the driver demonstration run Hamiltons car broke down and he had to catch a ride back. His car had to be pushed back. But the Launch Party is a sampling of what F1 believes can do to make next years Las Vegas race worth the price of admission. Hamilton doesnt know where Vegas entrylevel 500 standingroom only ticket ranks among other F1 races but did note costs have risen for the consumers. Its getting more and more expensive and less accessible to go to our events and I wouldnt think that is a good thing Hamilton told The AP. But with three stops next year across the United States F1 believes it has options and experiences for every type of fan at different price levels. And on the current path Vegas plans to be as glamorous as Monaco maybe more. What we want to create is to have different races with different personality with different characteristics with different fans with different price points with different expectations Domenicali said. If all Grand Prixs were equal it wouldnt be what we wanted. I think what were going to present to our fans in Vegas will be unique and in the U.S. we are just scratching the surface of what we can do. Copyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Gary Anderson assesses every F1 team's front wing design, https://the-race.com/formula-1/gary-anderson-assesses-every-f1-teams-front-wing-design/, But because of the flow structure effect it loses more or less the same amount of rear end. Small changes of front wing angle should have very little impact on the flow structure coming off the trailing edge of the front wing. MERCEDESMercedes very different sidepod concept means its no surprise to see that the front wing concept is different from its direct competition. This photograph is from a slightly different angle so its difficult to get a true leading edge or trailing edge profile. ALPHATAURIAlphaTauri is in line with the Alpine and McLaren front wing concept more than sister team Red Bull., The front wing of a Formula 1 car is not only one of the most visible aerodynamic components but also the most significant. Thats because it is the first part that has to penetrate the theoretically stationary air mass which is why I often say that its a critical part of how the airflow structure is initiated. And its that flow structure that the rest of the car has to work with. As the downforce increases with the speed of the car it is also critical that the front of the car  the nose front wing and front tyres  actually penetrate that stationary air mass as opposed to pushing it along in front of it. For example lets say the car is travelling through the air mass at 250kmh with a theoretical downforce of 2000kg. If its pushing some of that mass in front of it at say 20kmh it means the relative cartoair speed is 230kmh so the downforce is reduced to 1700kg. Thats a big loss. But if it can be sped up then it has the opposite effect. It means the flow under the wing is travelling faster than the flow over the top of it and in effect this is what the leading edge of the underfloor uses to produce its downforce. However its not quite as blackandwhite as that as that flow travelling under the wing is now thinner from expansion so produces less downforce. How F1 2022s top teams have approached a key packaging dilemma Read more Every item on the cars aerodynamic surface including the tyres will have this effect of slowing or speeding up the overall flow. That is why every aerodynamic surface is important. But because the front wing is the first part to affect the airspeed over the rest of the car it gets priority. However it also has to produce enough downforce to balance the car in its own right and be adjustable within a small range to allow for changes in what a driver wants in terms of balance. Its very easy to produce a front wing that produces more front end when you increase the angle. But because of the flow structure effect it loses more or less the same amount of rear end. Thats great for a balance change but doesnt improve the overall grip so has a minimum effect on laptime. Its not quite so easy to produce a front wing that when you increase its angle gives you more front but doesnt disturb the rear. But thats the direction you need to be going in simply because you get improved balance and a small increase in overall grip. Hardest of all is to produce a front wing that when you increase its angle you get more front and because of the flow structure effect increasing the air speed over the rest of the car you also get more rear. So this is ideal and as it is a decent step in overall grip level as well as a better balance you get the best return in laptime. The worst outcome is a front wing that when increased in angle actually suffers some separation problems and loses front load and because of the detrimental effect of the flow structure also loses rear. Believe me I have seen them all in my time and Im pretty sure there are still a few like the latter out there. Its easy to have a flow structure that works at one level but when you need to go either side of those settings the cars relative performance drops away. So in constructors championship order lets take a close look at the front wing assemblies each team ran in Mexico. I have put a red line yellow for the Haas on the leading edge at the flowseparation point and again on the trailing edge. This is to show the different concept of front wing span loading. The less uniform it is the more peak loading you will get and potentially the more transfer flow you will get. Peak loading is when the wing across its span has a lot of shape increased camber in it. Because of that the airflow on the undersurface in that area is being accelerated more than either side of it so that area will pull airflow from wherever it can generating transverse flow. RED BULL The front wing leading edge and trailing edge are fairly simple. This will introduce a fairly uniform flow through between the front wheel and the chassis allowing the underfloor leading edge to be optimised to generate consistent downforce from that area. Small changes of front wing angle should have very little impact on the flow structure coming off the trailing edge of the front wing. FERRARI Ferrari is not dissimilar to Red Bull but its inboard fixed section of wing to the nose is longer. This means that the adjustable section is shorter so to get the same balance change as Red Bull Ferrari will have to increase the angle of the adjustable flap more. This could easily mean that it affects the flow to the rest of the car just that little bit more. Red Bull has pullrod front suspension and Ferrari has pushrod yet has more or less the same detail of front wing so the difference is not aimed at optimising the air flow around the pushrod. MERCEDES Mercedes very different sidepod concept means its no surprise to see that the front wing concept is different from its direct competition. Actually along with its sidepods the front wing is fairly distinctive compared to all of the other nine teams. That doesnt mean its wrong as it will be designed to suit the car but it highlights the fact that the main flow structure heading for the sidepods is very different from the other teams. Having such a camel hump style front flap trailing edge will generate some transverse flow but as can be seen with the narrow sidepod inlets further rearward the weaker flow from that area is being exited through the gap they create. ALPINE Visually the opposite of the Mercedes we have the Alpine with reduced camber in the area where Mercedes has increased camber on its front wing. Alpine also runs a small Gurney flap on the trailing edge of the flap just in front of the tyre. This will help this section of the wing to work more consistently when the front wheels are steered and should produce more front downforce with steering lock to fight the understeer these cars have in slow and mediumspeed corners. Both have pushrod suspension so as with Red Bull and Ferrari the wing detail has very little to do with the suspension layout. M c LAREN McLaren is similar to Alpine with its rear flap trailing edge detail. It also runs a small Gurney flap on the trailing edge of the flap in front of the tyre. ALFA ROMEO Alfa Romeo is more in line with Alpine and McLaren. This photograph is from a slightly different angle so its difficult to get a true leading edge or trailing edge profile. But you can see the duck bill section under the nose in more detail and the fact that the forward element is more of a flow conditioner hanging off the second element. The second element is more of an actual mainplane. Alfa Romeo is not the only one to do this but its just that little bit more pronounced on its car. ASTON MARTIN Surprisingly Aston Martin is more in line with the Mercedes front wing philosophy than the others. You would think that recruiting Dan Fallows from Red Bull as technical director means its front wing would have followed suit after its change in sidepod concept earlier in the season. Aston Martins exRed Bull tech lead highlights what its missing Read more After all the front wing sets up the airflow that feeds those sidepods. Perhaps its not so surprising when you consider that currently Aston Martin uses the Mercedes windtunnel. Windtunnels and front wings have always been very difficult to get to correlate to get the same car balance between the model and the full size car there is normally some level of angle offset required. You need to work hard to minimise that offset. If there is any problem with windtunnel boundary layer control it will manifest itself in anything that is aerodynamically highly loaded and running close to the ground such as front wings or now ground effect underfloors. HAAS This is similar albeit not identical to Ferrari. And thats not surprising when you consider that they have a close working relationship even though their aerodynamic concept and design work has to be separate. Haas has stuck with what it calls a highdownforce concept that suits more circuits than not but by doing this it has suffered in races where other cars have just been that bit faster on the straights. ALPHATAURI AlphaTauri is in line with the Alpine and McLaren front wing concept more than sister team Red Bull. AlphaTauri follows its own path as far as aerodynamics are concerned which is nice to see but sometimes Im sure this must be that bit frustrating for the drivers. WILLIAMS For Williams or what is the skeleton of the Williams we all remember its been a real fight these last few seasons. At times with George Russell and now Alex Albon there have been and still are moments of true brilliance but Im afraid it happens only too rarely. Nyck de Vries showed with his great performance as a standin at Monza that the car is definitely efficient but Im afraid with that efficiency it lacks downforce. But the front wing is not unlike Red Bull or Ferrari so there are no major problems there. To sum up all you can say is that the Red Bull is a car for all occasions. Whether the track is fast slow bumpy smooth wet or dry it seems that in Max Verstappens hands at least it can rise to the occasion. Its similar with Ferrari in Charles Leclercs hands. Are these two guys simply brilliant or is it that the car is designed around them For many seasons we had the debate of was it Lewis Hamilton or was it the car that was bringing Mercedes success I think this season we are getting part of the answer. Personally I think it is a bit of both. You cant blame any team for buying into what a driver is asking for if when you can give it to them they go out and immediately use it. I remember doing a test at a small circuit in France in preparation for Monaco. The driver came in after a 10lap circuit familiarisation run complaining of massive understeer. We had a look around and discovered we still had the travel front torsion bars fitted. These were incredibly stiff to stop the car bouncing around in the back of the truck. So we fitted the correct stiffness torsion bars he went back out and did more or less the same laptime and came in complaining of traction problems. Some people you can never satisfy but the best drivers always produce the speed the car they are driving is capable of. With these current stringent technical regulations performance is all in the detail but Im pleased to see that the 10 teams have not arrived at the same visual concept. Long gone are the days of a team doing something radical as today extracting the most from your concept is all about understanding what you are getting from what you have. That has proved more difficult with these newfor2022 aerodynamic regulations. To move forward you need to recognise what is not giving you what you want or at least what you think it should.
PREMA – The Mercedes of the F1 Feeder Series, https://lastwordonsports.com/motorsports/2022/11/07/prema-the-mercedes-of-the-f1-feeder-series/, Since their inception in 1984 the PREMA have endured a dominance in the feeder series that is akin to Mercedes in F1. In 1990 PREMA Powerteam made their introduction to the Formula feeder series leading up to F1. Six years after their inception PREMA won their first Drivers Championship with Roberto Colciago in the Italian Formula 3 Championship. Since then they have gone on to win a remarkable thirtythree Drivers Championships across the feeder series. PREMA won in 2003  2011 as well when the series was called Formula 3 Euro Series., Since their inception in 1984 the PREMA have endured a dominance in the feeder series that is akin to Mercedes in F1. In 1990 PREMA Powerteam made their introduction to the Formula feeder series leading up to F1. Since then both the team and their drivers have endured countless successes and championships. Their dominance in the feeder series is akin to the dominance that MercedesAMG Petronus had in Formula 1 between 2014  2021 winning seven Drivers Championships and eight Team Championships in a row. A Long  Storied History PREMA Powerteam Racing or simply PREMA was founded in 1984 by Angelo Rosin and Giorgio Piccolo. They are based in Veneto Italy. Six years after their inception PREMA won their first Drivers Championship with Roberto Colciago in the Italian Formula 3 Championship. Since then they have gone on to win a remarkable thirtythree Drivers Championships across the feeder series. That includes a streak of six championships in a row in European Formula 3 2012  2018. PREMA won in 2003  2011 as well when the series was called Formula 3 Euro Series. Theyve claimed the Drivers Championship in 2019 2020  2021 as well as this years F3 Team Championship. Beyond finding standout drivers they have won twentynine Team Championships. Check out a few of the names to drive for PREMA through the years Esteban Ocon Nicholas Latifi Robert Kubica Antonio Giovinazzi Pierre Gasly Oscar Piastri Logan Sargeant Lance Stroll Mick Schumacher Charles Leclerc Zhou Guanyu Nyck de Vries Jacques Villeneuve Jamie Chadwick Robert Shwartzman Felix Rosenqvist Dindo Capello Kamui Kobayashi Ferrari Connection With PREMA being an Italianbased team they have had the opportunity to connect with another Italianbased megahouse  Scuderia Ferrari. In 2009 the Ferrari Drivers Academy FDA was opened an academy based in Maranello Italy. Its aim is to enhance the skills of young drivers. Like PREMA theyve seen some incredible names come through their development system including Charles Leclerc Lance Stroll Zhou Guanyu Mick Schumacher Sergio Perez Jules Bianci The link between PREMA and the FDA could be one reason for their major success seeing as the drivers are based in Maranello and use equipment that others dont have access such as the Ferrari simulator. The knowledge that the drivers have can help improve the car and prepare them as they move up the ranks. If Mick Schumacher retains his seat at Haas next season that will be 10 drivers from the PREMAFDA system. Half the Formula 1 grid. That is also dependent on Formula 2 driver Logan Sargeant joining Williams for 2023 if he can gain enough super licence points at the season finale in Abu Dhabi. Regardless there isnt a driver development program out there that can match their history and alumni list. This year PREMA won the F3 Team Championship as well as titles in German F4 Italian F4 and the Formula Regional European Championship. With another round of talented young drivers expected in 2023 its realistic to presume that their success isnt diminishing any time soon. Featured Image Credit KARIM SAHIBAFP via Getty Images

I have been privileged to witness the growth of the Mahindra Formula E team and feel proud to have now been entrusted with driving the team to even greater performance and results. The coming months will be tough and will require a lot of hard work but the goal is clearly to be on the pace in what promises to be an ultracompetitive field of manufacturers and teams. It is a new chapter and major challenge in my career and I cannot wait to get started Frederic Bertrand joins Mahindra from the FIA Photo by Sam Bloxham  Motorsport Images Bertrands prior involvement in the development of the Gen3 car is likely to be a bone of contention between other teams and Mahindra although the route from the governing body to join a competing team in a championship has been previously travelled in motorsport. Within Formula 1 Marcin Budkowski was placed on a threemonth gardening leave period by the FIA in 2017 before leaving to take up a role with Renault. Exdeputy race director Laurent Mekies also left the FIA in 2018 after a year to take up the sporting director role at Ferrari. The FIA can confirm that Frederic Bertrand formerly Formula E and Innovative Sport Activities Department Director has resigned from his position to seek other opportunities said the governing body in a statement. The FIA thanks Frederic for his many contributions to the organisation over the past 10 years and wishes him well in his future endeavours. Bertrands predecessor Gill left Mahindra in September having served as team principal and CEO since Formula Es inception and is currently on a period of gardening leave until next year.
This Gorgeous 450cc Retro Bike Is Made By Formula 1 Team, https://www.zigwheels.com/news-features/general-news/this-gorgeous-450cc-retro-bike-is-made-by-formula-1-team/47624/, Get latest updates onthe automobile community Login NowFormer underdog F1 team Hesketh which won several podiums and races with legendary racer James Hunt has a motorcycle division. The company which was revived in 2014 teased its allnew 450cc motorcycle christened the Heresy 450 a couple of months ago in August. While the bike has been revealed through discreet images via social media the full reveal will take place tomorrow at EICMA. But the motor is built as per Heskeths specifications in Taiwan featuring twin ports twin injectors and a Euro5 certification. Expect the Heresy 450 to retail at around 14000  15000 Rs 13 lakh  Rs 14 lakh  a steep investment wed say despite the kit on offer., Get latest updates on the automobile community Login Now Former underdog F1 team Hesketh which won several podiums and races with legendary racer James Hunt has a motorcycle division. The company which was revived in 2014 teased its allnew 450cc motorcycle christened the Heresy 450 a couple of months ago in August. While the bike has been revealed through discreet images via social media the full reveal will take place tomorrow at EICMA. The company claims its the most technically advanced Hesketh ever produced. At the heart lies a 450cc mill sourced from Honda originally belonging to a Honda XR400. And if we take the XR400s motor specs as a reference the mill should produce similar power figures if not more which are around 34PS and 33Nm. But the motor is built as per Heskeths specifications in Taiwan featuring twin ports twin injectors and a Euro5 certification. So we could expect better power figures. The Heresy 450 also features a KTech suspension a handbuilt tubular steel frame and radially mounted brake calipers with twin disc brakes up front  not something youd see on 450cc bikes these days. Oddly enough the bike runs a twin gascharged shock absorber set up at the back presumably with preload and rebound adjustment. Up front you have adjustable upside forks and an LED headlight. The twin underseat exhaust is yet another design element that enthusiasts would appreciate. Also carbon fibre components such as the fenders flyscreen and bodywork suggest that Hesketh has tried to keep the bikes weight in check. Designwise Hesketh has kept things simple. The smaller roadster sticks to the companys neoretro design language with minimal bodywork. The chiselled tank flows into a quilted seat with a seat cowl. The taillight is expected to be an allLED unit as well. Expect the Heresy 450 to retail at around 14000  15000 Rs 13 lakh  Rs 14 lakh  a steep investment wed say despite the kit on offer. But its mostly targeted towards a niche segment of buyers with deep pockets who love the brand. More details will follow soon this week at EICMA so stay tuned to ZigWheels. Source RideApart VisorDown

During the Mexican Grand Prix weekend it was revealed that the Red Bull drivers were avoiding Sky Sports due their concerns over a lack of impartiality when discussing the finale to the 2021 season and the cost cap saga. The reaction was believed to be partially related to comments made by Sky Sports Ted Kravitz who described the 2021 championship as being robbed from Lewis Hamilton.

Is Red Bull's boycott of Sky Sports unnecessary?, https://sixsports.in/is-red-bulls-boycott-of-sky-sports-unnecessary/, Red Bull has won 16 races so far in 2022 and is on course to match McLarens record of 11 straight victories from 1988. With a sprint in Brazil to increase the overall tally they may potentially surpass Mercedes record of 765 points in a single season. But as a result of the recent events there is a general perception that Red Bull has damaged a campaign that unquestionably restored them to the peak of the F1. While this was grabbing the headlines why would Red Bull risk damaging their brand by refusing to communicate with Sky Sports at the Mexican Grand Prix But even if he was robbed was he robbed by Verstappen or Red Bull, You would anticipate that when a team has a season that shatters the records the accolades would outweigh the inevitable criticisms. There will always be criticism. The proverb You cant please everyone all of the time has been around for a very long timeliterally centuries before Formula 1 even came into force. And particularly in a sport where the polarization of its fan base today equals that of football. Red Bull has won 16 races so far in 2022 and is on course to match McLarens record of 11 straight victories from 1988. With a sprint in Brazil to increase the overall tally they may potentially surpass Mercedes record of 765 points in a single season. Of course they have already rewritten the record books as Max Verstappen broke the record for most wins in a single season with 14 victories under his belt surpassing the previous record of 13 jointly set by Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel. But as a result of the recent events there is a general perception that Red Bull has damaged a campaign that unquestionably restored them to the peak of the F1. Most of that is linked to the budgetcap controversy. Irrespective of your opinion of the conclusion the FIA has dealt with it and performances next year may still show the consequences. While this was grabbing the headlines why would Red Bull risk damaging their brand by refusing to communicate with Sky Sports at the Mexican Grand Prix It all came down to remarks allegedly made on Sky about the titledeciding race in Abu Dhabi last year where the word robbed was used in reference to Lewis Hamilton as he was denied a recordbreaking eighth world championship by Verstappen. But even if he was robbed was he robbed by Verstappen or Red Bull Absolutely not. Nobody could argue that they did not have a hand in any of this all they did was an attempt to win the race which they did. However the calls made by Race Control which provided them with the opportunity to do so were the suspect. Did that justify their boycott of the sports main broadcaster for the duration of an entire race weekend And not just the English broadcast but also their German and Italian counterparts. Words like silly petty and unnecessary come to mind. For more updates follow us on Twitter.

Meanwhile the scrolled forward section of the edge wing was not only more generously rolled over in the update because the strike that helps encourage flow direction was also moved and reoriented.

Instead these appear to be more of an answer to Mercedes current configuration with the team focused on the design of the floor and fences upstream., Listen to this article These were fitted to test driver Nyck de Vries W13 as he completed duties in FP1 as part of each teams requirement to run a young driver. With Mercedes now having got on top of understanding the key weaknesses of the W13 it is using this stage of the season to conduct some experiments that can help it plot its best path for next years challenger. As a result of its push the new floor pictured above features several optimisations.

Mercedes W13 floor detail Mexico City GP FP1 Nyck de Fries Photo by Giorgio Piola The floor run on De Vries car didnt feature the design aspects of the new race floor around the edge wing white arrows above. Instead these appear to be more of an answer to Mercedes current configuration with the team focused on the design of the floor and fences upstream. This will in turn have an impact on the performance envelope of the floor and diffuser downstream. And whilst we cant see what the team has done where the real magic happens  on the underside of the floor  its clear that its experiments include a change in profile for the floor and outer floor strake with the surface more inwardly pinched and the ramp shape altered. Interestingly this follows a general pattern weve seen in the back half of the season with numerous teams including Alpine and Alfa Romeo opting to pinch in this section and alter the allowable volume on the underside by raising the ramp externally. The floor wasnt the only experiment being conducted by Mercedes either as the team ran both its cars in different aerodynamic configurations during Fridays free practice sessions in Mexico. George Russells W13 was fitted with its high downforce rear wing complete with Gurney flap on the trailing edge plus the newer specification front wing that had first appeared at the United States Grand Prix minus the controversial slot gap separator brackets. Mercedes W13 front wing detail Mexican GP Photo by Giorgio Piola The slot gap separators had been considered to be doing too much heavy lifting from an aerodynamic perspective with the governing body and the teams rivals concerned this was their primary function rather than being there to offer support to the two elements they were connected to. Mercedes had removed the separators but retained the new flap and endplate design which also aims to increase the level of outwash that can be generated. On the other side of the garage the rear wing didnt feature a Gurney on the trailing edge and there were several versions of the old front wing put into action all with varying degrees of the upper flaps trailing edge cut back. Mercedes W13 front wing detail Photo by Giorgio Piola As the team had gathered the data it required on Friday it set up both cars with the newer specification front wing and with the Gurney deployed on the trailing edge of the rear wing for qualifying and the race.

Danish Formula 2 driver Frederik Vesti will get the chance to drive a Mercedes W13 in Abu Dhabi at Postseason testing. Mercedes was likely to go with Nyck de Vries for the said test but after his deal with AlphaTauri it is now ruled out. The Dutchman would be testing for the Italian team instead. Vesti is being labeled as the successor of Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes. Vesti is currently competing in Formula 2 as a Mercedes junior driver. The Danish driver has also completed simulator work alongside De Vries and Stoffel Vandoorne. Stoffel Vandoorne is also leaving to join Aston Martin as their reserve driver. This makes Vesti the obvious choice. A childhood dream coming true I will complete my first ever running in a Mercedes F1 car at the Young Driver Test in Abu Dhabi said Vesti. Its an incredible sign of trust from Mercedes which I like to thank them for Vesti is currently eighth in the 2022 Formula 2 Championship. The 20years old won the sprint race in Baku and currently has four podiums to his name. He also won the Formula Regional European Championship in 2019. Lewis Hamilton is currently planning to stay in F1 for the foreseeable future. By the time he hangs his helmet Vesti would be a good choice to get in as his replacement.

Hawkins on F1's new female-only series: Don't disregard older W Series drivers, https://racingnews365.com/hawkins-on-f1s-new-female-only-series-dont-disregard-older-w-series-drivers, Jessica Hawkins believes that W Series and the W Series drivers will continue to play an important role in the progression of female racing drivers despite F1 intention to launch a similar racing series. It was recently revealed that Formula 1 was targeting the introduction of a new femaleonly racing series possibly as early as next season. The news came not long after the curtailment of the third W Series season which was unable to run its final three rounds due to funding issues. Several of the W Series drivers have secured roles in Formula 1 since the championships introduction including Hawkins who now is also a Driver Ambassador for the Aston Martin F1 team. Hawkins expressed her support for the series and believed that having the championships compete against each other would be detrimental for both series., Jessica Hawkins believes that W Series and the W Series drivers will continue to play an important role in the progression of female racing drivers despite F1 intention to launch a similar racing series. It was recently revealed that Formula 1 was targeting the introduction of a new femaleonly racing series possibly as early as next season. The news came not long after the curtailment of the third W Series season which was unable to run its final three rounds due to funding issues. The planning for a new allfemale racing feeder series believed to be planned at a Formula 4 level is still in the early stages and would still be required to go through the usual approval processes with the FIA. Several of the W Series drivers have secured roles in Formula 1 since the championships introduction including Hawkins who now is also a Driver Ambassador for the Aston Martin F1 team. Hawkins unwilling to create a rivalry with F1s series The timing of the revelation of an F1backed female racing series has raised eyebrows but it is said that the intention is for the two championships to coexist. Hawkins expressed her support for the series and believed that having the championships compete against each other would be detrimental for both series. To be honest we dont really know too much about it. I dont know how long these conversations have been going for but I can only see it as a positive Hawkins told media including RacingNews365.com. Any championship that helps females out should be welcomed and we should do everything we can to welcome it. I also would like to think that it would work alongside W series I would hate to think that they would ever be competing against each other because thats not what were fighting for here. Its not who has got the best championship its how we work together. Were all trying to achieve the same thing. So yes I think its a positive thing.

Deal he didn't want was key to rise of Williams's new F1 driver, https://the-race.com/formula-1/deal-he-didnt-want-was-key-to-rise-of-williamss-new-f1-driver/, For its planned 2023 Formula 1 driver lineup Williams is gambling on someone who barely 12 months ago was facing a much less certain trajectory. When Logan Sargeant joined the Williams driver academy towards the end of 2021 he had finished seventh in his third season of Formula 3. Does Albon deserve more than a Williams F1 future Williamss support has been massive Sargeant says and made him a better racing driver but also just a better person in general. If he does then the 2023 Williams F1 seat is his., For its planned 2023 Formula 1 driver lineup Williams is gambling on someone who barely 12 months ago was facing a much less certain trajectory. When Logan Sargeant joined the Williams driver academy towards the end of 2021 he had finished seventh in his third season of Formula 3. Sargeant gets 2023 Williams F1 seat subject to superlicence Read more The basic facts were unimpressive one reversegrid win and a clear championship regression after finishing third and fighting for the title in 2020 all the way to a chaotic Mugello finale. After a season fighting at the front with the crack Prema team it showed exactly why Sargeant had been extremely hesitant about racing for Charouz which finished last in the 2020 championship. But he didnt have much of a choice. Funding issues meant he was not going to step up to F2 so he was exploring alternatives in sportscars and was quite keen on Indy Lights. Staying on the F1 ladder looked unlikely until the lastgasp Charouz F3 deal was struck in May 2021 on the eve of the season. The end of 2020 it was my best season at that point and it wasnt looking great Sargeant says. You always keep the faith and the hope but we didnt really have a great direction and where we wanted to go. We did have some opportunities to do some sportscars GTs even a possible IndyCar seat. But the F3 thing was there and it was the chance to stay in Europe. To be honest I was quite tentative about taking that deal but I had a great support team around me between my parents my brother as well and my trainer and they all pushed me to take that challenging opportunity and make the most of it. Williams Snubbing our F1ready junior wouldve been wrong Read more Which is what he did. Sargeants results dragged Charouz to a level it was nowhere near before 2021 and the fact it finished last again in 2022 with just one point shows how much of an anomaly the year with Sargeant was. If anything winning one reversegrid race and finishing seventh in the points was a massive overachievement. Those that paid attention knew Sargeant had done well. Williams was convinced enough to bring him into the fold. In the end having to take an F3 deal that I wasnt certain I wanted to do turned out to be a masterstroke. That helped me mature as a driver and also pushed me to be a leader to bring what was a below par team to the midfield by the end of the season says Sargeant. I think we did a really good job there. And that just really set me up for a good 2022. I couldnt have done it without the support of Williams and Ill forever be grateful for that. Williams gave Sargeant his F1 debut in the postseason Abu Dhabi test last year  that was obviously a show of support and that gave me confidence  and allowed him to step up F2 with Carlin. He has become a twotime race winner as a rookie and has been a frontrunner in the championship. To say his campaign has exceeded expectations wouldnt quite be correct given he entered the season with none. But he admits when you start having extremely strong qualifyings and getting some race wins the goal and the expectation shifts and now its set at a higher level. Does Albon deserve more than a Williams F1 future Our verdict Read more At that point it was full focus on trying to secure a seat for 2023 he says. The strong midseason form has been enough to ride out the storm of a run of poor results sometimes selfinflicted and sometimes totally out of his control. Williamss support has been massive Sargeant says and made him a better racing driver but also just a better person in general. It has brought him to the brink of ending Americas wait for a homegrown F1 driver an achievement owed as much to his own resilience at carving out a path in Europe  from his karting days when he was a world champion through the entirety of his car racing career in Formula 4 Formula Renault Formula 3 and Formula 2. I just feel like Ive been putting in all the hard work in Europe through my whole career and made that commitment early that this was the route I wanted to take he says. I feel like its just been a long road of dedication hard work thats got me to this point. And I still need to go out and earn it in the last round. Sargeant is not guaranteed a superlicence yet but is in a very good position to secure it. If he does then the 2023 Williams F1 seat is his. It is the ultimate vindication of Sargeant staying the course but surely beyond what he could have ever hoped for when joined the Williams stable a year ago  let alone in the difficult months before that.

Mercedes' 2023 'DNA' change will go far beyond sidepods, https://the-race.com/formula-1/mercedes-2023-dna-change-will-go-far-beyond-sidepods/, The teams W13 was blighted by porpoising problems over the first few races of the year preventing Mercedes from understanding the real problems with its 2022 concept. Its no surprise then that there have been hints of a concept shift for Mercedes next year. I think the DNA of the car is going to change for next year thats clear Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff said. Mercedes has chosen its path for 2023 with the hope it can return to F1s title fight and get on par with Red Bull and Ferrari which both usurped it this year. But Mercedes is still in the phase of trying to learn from every upgrade it brings knowing a full concept change midseason in the cost cap era just wouldnt be possible., Its become increasingly clear over the course of the 2022 Formula 1 season that Mercedes solution to the championships new regulations has not worked. Mercedes has gone from eight successive constructors championships to a campaign that could be its first without a win since 2011 while its chief 2021 rival Red Bull has won 16 of the 20 races. The teams W13 was blighted by porpoising problems over the first few races of the year preventing Mercedes from understanding the real problems with its 2022 concept. Mercedes claims its found mistake that doomed its 2022 Read more Mercedes has brought a consistent stream of upgrades to try and improve the pace of the W13 with the latest development a new front wing that it debuted at last weekends Mexican Grand Prix after tweaks to make it legal. It has only scored 10 fewer points than Ferrari in the second half of the year but the team believes its still suffering from a mistake that it traces back to the end of last year  one that it was only able to identify during its postrace analysis of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix in June. Its no surprise then that there have been hints of a concept shift for Mercedes next year. But that could go far beyond a pivot away from its unique zerosidepod design. I think the DNA of the car is going to change for next year thats clear Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff said. It doesnt necessarily mean that the bodywork is going to look very different. But certainly what is part of the DNA of the car will change for next year. This is potentially a change that goes far beyond the sidepod concept and instead covers the underlying architecture of the car its suspension and underfloor. Mercedes fundamental problem in 2022 has been its rear suspension setup which prevents the team from being able to run the W13 at the optimal ride height without the bouncing problems that rattled its drivers to the point of back and chest pains earlier in the season. Mercedes has chosen its path for 2023 with the hope it can return to F1s title fight and get on par with Red Bull and Ferrari which both usurped it this year. I think weve found a path we believe in and a path we can move along and get better technical director Mike Elliott said. F1 is a learning game you never know all the answers and what weve been trying to do is to make sure theres nothing were missing keep digging see if its something else we need to find. Youve got to look and say weve got two fantastic competitors a lot of good competitors but two very strong ones in Ferrari and Red Bull. We need to go into the winter and do a good job and thats the only way well get on par with them and hopefully beat them. Next years car will look different Im not going to say why but it will look different. Dont be fooled by Mexico Mercedes is months behind Red Bull Read more Some of the upgrades Mercedes has brought to the W13 will be irrelevant for its 2023 design not just because of the potential changed concept for next year but because of the new floor rules that change the aerodynamic demands and therefore require a different solution. But Mercedes is still in the phase of trying to learn from every upgrade it brings knowing a full concept change midseason in the cost cap era just wouldnt be possible. Wholesale car concept changes might have been possible for teams in the past but with the new Aerodynamic Testing Allowances limits and the cost cap  which will further reduce next year  Mercedes had no choice but to bide its time until 2023 for a proper change. It has at least benefitted from a bigger ATA during the second half of 2022 after the percentages were reset midway through the season when Mercedes was third behind Ferrari and Red Bull in the constructors championship as it is now. This advantage will help Mercedes claw back what it believes to be a 10month deficit to our main competitors but it remains to be seen whether the concept it has chosen will be the right one. Logic and a look back at the convergence in the years following major F1 rule changes would dictate Mercedes will move its car concept closer to the team with the best solution to F1s new regulations  Red Bull  but we wont know for sure until the car hits the track in Bahrain in February.

Geri Halliwell a.k.a. Ginger Spice from the Spice Girls joining the video game adaptation along with the previously announced David Harbour and Archie Madekwe. Rather than an adaptation of some kind of plot from the Gran Turismo games  the movie is based on a true story about a player who is so good at Gran Turismo racing games that he gets a chance to try being a real professional racing driver with Madekwe playing the teen racer and Harbour playing a retired driver who teaches him how to translate his skills on a DualShock to the real world. Actually if hes serious hes probably playing with a wheel and not a controller which should make for a relatively easy transition.

Why Max Verstappen has a lack of excitement about breaking Formula 1 win record, https://www.planetf1.com/news/max-verstappen-lack-excitement-record/, Although Max Verstappen has broken the record for most wins in a single season it is not something he spends too much time thinking about. I try to win the races and that for me is the most important. Another great race he said in regard to Mexico. So another great race but also its just an incredible season for us as a team. Never thought I would be able to win 14 races in a year., Although Max Verstappen has broken the record for most wins in a single season it is not something he spends too much time thinking about. The Dutchman has already broken plenty of records including youngest driver to ever enter score points and win a race and given a rule change that states drivers must now be 18 and over to race in F1 he is likely to keep those accolades. With his victory in Mexico he overtook Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel in terms of the highest number of wins achieved in a single season having won 14 of the 20 races so far. But it appears that is not something he is too fussed about and throughout his career every milestone he passes has been met with an apathetic shrug by Verstappen. The Red Bull driver has been explaining why he is so nonplussed about those records. I was never really interested in stats he said at the postMexican Grand Prix press conference. I just live in the moment. I just try to of course do the best I can every single weekend. I try to win the races and that for me is the most important. Every single weekend when I go home and I can say to myself I maximised or close to that Im happy. But of course a lot in Formula 1 depends on your whole package. And we are having a great package and Im just enjoying the moment and Im not that interested in keeping in touch with every stat. But of course it is an amazing season and Im very happy with winning so many races. Verstappen did however admit 14 wins in a season is something he never thought he would be able to do. Another great race he said in regard to Mexico. We knew the first stint would be the crucial one for us to keep the soft tyres alive long enough which seemed to work. I did struggle a bit towards the end but luckily the gap was big enough to extend a few laps. Once we put on the medium tyres everything was working quite well. I think quite early on we figured we could make it to the end. So another great race but also its just an incredible season for us as a team. Never thought I would be able to win 14 races in a year. But Im incredibly proud. Read more George Russell teases Sky F1s David Croft with Red Bull boycott joke

JasonPhelps Brandon Flowers of The Killers performs at the Las Vegas Grand PrixFormula One party at Garden of the Gods at Caesars Palace on Saturday Nov. 5 2022. JasonPhelps For the past five years Brandon Flowers has not lived in Las Vegas. But his soul is still here. The rock star became wistful Friday night hours after gazing at the Las Vegas horizon. I went to visit my dad in Boulder City and I hadnt seen a desert sunset in a long time. It was emotional for me Flowers said a few minutes before The Killers Las Vegas Grand Prix Fan Fest performance at Caesars Palaces Garden of the Gods. It was beautiful. Flowers scrolled to a series of photos on his phone the orangered sunset glowing against the blue sky. Hes right it was beautiful. I mean no matter where we go or where or where we are theres always going to be a piece of my heart here said Flowers whose family moved to Park City Utah about five years ago. I carry Las Vegas with me for sure. I was thinking of that today. There was something about the light today at about 430 that really got to me. The Killers performance capped the Las Vegas Grand PrixFormula One festival weekend which effectively took over the heart of the Strip. The bands show for a few hundred VIP attendees was far removed from the race cars staging area performed at the resorts lavish pool oasis. The pits it was not. The concert marked The Killers third performance this year in Las Vegas. They turned the Chelsea at The Cosmopolitan into a bounce house in April. Their August show at TMobile Arena was a veritable Vegas revival. It felt as if all 18000 fans were locals for the emotional outpouring. The Killers frequent and lucrative appearances in Vegas lead to the obvious inquiry Will the band ever host a residency in their hometown Weve talked a little bit about it. Im not Im definitely not opposed to it. I love the idea said Flowers donning a brilliant magenta blazer over a black shirt and black slacks for Saturdays show. I thought it was groundbreaking when Celine Dion and Elton John sort of started the residencies here at Caesars. Flowers then grinned reaching to his youth. You know I used to go the Omnimax here when I was a kid the front man said referring to the spaceage theater complex pulled apart for the Colosseum. So it is very interesting to me to see what became of it. Flowers has clearly given the residency concept some thought. The band would doubtlessly be a popular draw at any Las Vegas venue. Vegas used to be thought of as a place where comedians and performers came to sort of end their careers Flowers said. So it was amazing for us to start here. I dont see it being a place where we would finish but I see no problem with a residency. Flowers wears a necklace to keep Vegas close. Its a modest state of Nevada piece a cheap pendant I bought on Etsy about 10 15 years ago as he describes. The band thats carrying it I got from Tiffany is more expensive. Its very sentimental to me. Flowers usually kisses the necklace as he leaves the stage. Flowers recently performed with one of his and most rock fans idols Bruce Springsteen. The Boss joined the band for its encore at Madison Square Garden on Oct. 1 on their Imploding the Mirage tour stop. They played classic Springsteen hits Born to Run and Badlands along withDustland their collaboration from last year that rearranges the Killers Day  Age single from 2008. OK it was unbelievable Flowers said with a laugh after being asked how it felt. We knew for about a month this was happening so we rehearsed his songs to death. We spent our sound checks all of our down time just like making sure that every t was crossed i was dotted. The band had intended to honor Springsteen near his New YorkNew Jersey roots. But they felt he paid his own tribute to the band. But it was such an honor for us just to do two of his songs Flowers said. It was such a compliment an incredible moment for us. Flowers performed some fast math on the bands history. The Killers formed in Las Vegas in November 2001. Thats when it started. I would have met Dave Keuning our guitarist exactly 21 years ago Flowers said. I just came to the realization that in my life Ive been in the band longer than I havent been in the band. Im 41 now looking at some of the bands who came out when we did like Franz Ferdinand The Strokes Interpol some great bands I like where we are. Flowers likes where he is too. Being in The Killers is part of my identity he said about to rock Vegas once more. Im so proud to be in this band.

Daniel Ricciardo however is on the other side of the United States. Attending his firstever Buffalo Bills game. The Australian F1 driver is a huge Buffalo Bills fan because of his unlikely friendship with quarterback Josh Allen.

Ricciardo was more than happy to flip the script showing off his cardboard cutout of Allen in the stands It appears that Allen loved seeing the cutout as he had a huge hug for Ricciardo upon spotting the driver with it in the stands Daniel Ricciardo held up and danced with a big Josh Allen face to greet him. One of those tweets I didnt think Id be writing but just delightful  pic.twitter.comK6Py0tjptl  Alaina Getzenberg agetzenberg November 6 2022 The F1 season is drawing to a close with just two races remaining on the schedule The Brazilian Grand Prix and the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. That also means Ricciardos time in F1 is winding down as well as the driver does not have a seat for next season. Given that his plans are in the air perhaps a future with the Bills in some capacity is in the cards
Domenicali: Lack of 2022 title showdown won’t impact F1 business, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/domenicali-lack-of-2022-title-showdown-wont-impact-f1-business/10395753/, Domenicali says that theres still plenty of interest in the remaining races of 2022 and he insists that there will be no negative impact on the F1 business. He also confident that next years fight will be more competitive and will potentially go the last round once again. And I would like to add if I may we are totally positive on the impact that the change in regulations brought this year. And Im totally confident that next year the fight on the track will arrive up to end of the calendar. First of all being a world championship we can spread around the world the risk of having this kind of situation to manage he said., In stark contrast to last years final lap thriller in Abu Dhabi Max Verstappen clinched the 2022 world championship at Suzuka with four rounds still to run while his Red Bull team secured the constructors version at the next race in the USA. Domenicali says that theres still plenty of interest in the remaining races of 2022 and he insists that there will be no negative impact on the F1 business. He also confident that next years fight will be more competitive and will potentially go the last round once again. Well actually we dont see any kind of risk at all he said when asked in a call with Wall Street analysts if the lack of a title showdown would be bad for F1s finances. And first of all we have the last race with sold out tickets and the numbers are really good. The attention will be shipped of course to other fights for the sporting perspective. So thats part of racing. And I would like to add if I may we are totally positive on the impact that the change in regulations brought this year. And we cannot comment on the fact that a team but specifically in this case Red Bull or Max Verstappen did an incredible job. Maybe some other teams didnt take the right opportunities. But what we saw on the track is wheeltowheel racing. Thats what we wanted. And Im totally confident that next year the fight on the track will arrive up to end of the calendar. And as youll see the last races on the sporting side there is a lot of attention. There is a fight for places that also for the team perspective is related to their financial position and the financial reward if they achieve a position. So I think that there will be a lot of interest in Brazil and Abu Dhabi too with no problem. Stefano Domenicali CEO Formula 1 Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images Domenicali also countered any suggestion that economic problems in Europe might impact F1 ticket sales and hence revenue in 2023. First of all being a world championship we can spread around the world the risk of having this kind of situation to manage he said. On the other hand the fact that we have longterm agreements will reduce the exposure to this risk. And what I can say and share with you is that we already see an incredible number of preregistrations with regards to ticketing of next year. So this is a good sign that youre seeing mainly in Europe where Im living where it is clear that this recession is taking place. But I think that the way that we are structured the way that we have done the deals will enable us to move forward in this direction. Therefore I would say this current situation lets us think that we should be optimistic in this context. Of course we monitor it but this is what we see today.

I think the timeline depends on how much Audi is going to support this team before they officially come as a manufacturer. Were still with Alfa Romeo., Listen to this article Last month Audi officially confirmed it would join forces with Sauber as its power unit manufacturer in 2026 when a new engine formula will kick in. After Alfa Romeos sponsorship deal with the Hinwil team lapses at the end of 2023 it is expected Audi will gradually start ramping up its involvement as it becomes a shareholder in the Swiss outfit. For current Alfa Romeo driver Bottas who joined the privateer after five years at Mercedes driving for a bona fide works team again is naturally an enticing prospect. When asked in Mexico if he is hoping to stick around at Sauber when Audi jumps on board in 2026 Bottas said Why not Im 33 years old so I hope that Im going to be there. Bottas explained that Audis entry will help keep both him and the team motivated in the coming years. I would say yes because if you look at the big picture I think its huge. Theres big potential for Sauber with Audi. No doubt they want to succeed in the future. They want to do well and show theyre serious. So I think for any driver on the grid especially for me now being already part of Sauber it would be very interesting to be part of that project. I definitely think its possible. Valtteri Bottas Alfa Romeo F1 Team Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images While Bottas conceded Alfa Romeo needs a lot of work to become competitive he hopes extra Audi backing ahead of its official 2026 entry can help the team bridge the gap to the frontrunners. Theres still work to do no doubt. Thats the fact. But its not that far you know the facilities are there the Finn pointed out. Some facilities some machinery can be better compared to a championshipwinning team. And the amount of people in the team is still a bit less than at least what I saw last year. But with the support of a manufacturer like Audi I see no reason why it wouldnt be possible. I think the timeline depends on how much Audi is going to support this team before they officially come as a manufacturer. Obviously nothing changes for next year. Were still with Alfa Romeo. And of course we hope that we can have a better car than this year. But then I think it depends on the support from 2024 onwards. If Audi are willing to support if theyre really helping a lot and supporting and if the power unit is good for 2026 which is impossible to predict at the moment then why not.
F1 Team Bosses Give Their Take On The Upcoming F1 Movie, https://www.wtf1.com/post/f1-team-bosses-give-their-take-on-the-upcoming-f1-movie/, The Hollywood star was in the paddock taking notes for his new motorsport movie and F1 bosses have been giving their views on the project which involves Lewis Hamilton.

It could be a mega step forward for F1 in general that as Netflix did a couple of years ago Vasseur said with Guenther Steiner also buzzing about the movie., Weve just about recovered after seeing Brad Pitt on our TV screens at the United States Grand Prix every few minutes. The Hollywood star was in the paddock taking notes for his new motorsport movie and F1 bosses have been giving their views on the project which involves Lewis Hamilton. Lewis has already called the movie the best racing movie thats ever existed but then he is a producer on it so hes not going to be too negative about it is he  To be fair to the seventime champ the pedigree behind the film does sound pretty incredible. Joseph Kosinski who helmed the recent Top Gun Maverick blockbuster is directing while legendary producer Jerry Bruckheimer is also involved. Then of course theres that Brad Pitt guy The gang behind the movie also met with F1 teams in Austin to share their vision and it sounds encouraging Alfa Romeos Team Principal Frederic Vasseur has even suggested that the movie could have the same effect as Drive To Survive did a few years ago. It could be a mega step forward for F1 in general that as Netflix did a couple of years ago Vasseur said with Guenther Steiner also buzzing about the movie. Talking about the technology which theyll be using Guenther said he was particularly impressed by it all. They used it to do Maverick. I didnt know that this existed he added. So I think they are the best out there at the moment to do something like this. As Fred said its the best for Formula 1. Its very good doing things like this with this calibre of people and I think there are no negatives there are just positives. Andreas Seidl the McLaren Team Principal also revealed that teams would be kept abreast of the plan of action which he said sounds very interesting and exciting. A bit of Top Gun style which I think for Formula 1 will be just great for the fans for the sport for us teams being involved as well. Im looking forward to that project seeing it first of all coming to life next year for us when its actually happening and then seeing the movie later on. There was suggestions that the film would be shot during F1 weekends in the second half of the 2023 season too  Are you looking forward to the movie Comment below.

Video: F1 pit-stops under two seconds are allowed (and THIS is why), https://racingnews365.com/video-f1-pit-stops-under-two-seconds-are-allowed-and-this-is-why, A change in Formula 1 regulations this year has seen the sport move from 13inch wheels to 18inch ones. This has made the tyres heavier and thus more difficult for mechanics to change all four of them quickly and safely during pitstops. A rule change halfway through 2021 changed the pitstop procedure making it even more difficult for mechanics to complete a lightning fast stop. However at the Mexico City Grand Prix McLaren became the first team to complete a subtwo second pitstop since the introduction of the new regulations changing all four tyres on Daniel Ricciardos car in 1.98 seconds.

But every time weve had a conversation the next day hes signed a contract with McLaren. Norris expanded on his comments about the Red Bull talks over the Mexico Grand Prix weekend saying his longterm McLaren deal was not in reaction to the talks with Red Bull. Christian Horner Team Principal Red Bull Racing congratulates Lando Norris McLaren 3rd position in Parc Ferme Photo by Mark Sutton  Motorsport ImagesIt was more just when it came to the end of my contract and it wasnt like we were talking heavily said Norris. It wasnt just Red Bull., Ahead of the United Sates Grand Prix Norris revealed in an interview with German publication Auto Motor und Sport that he had spoken to Red Bull ahead of signing his latest McLaren deal. Back in February Norris put pen to paper on a new longterm contract with McLaren that will keep him with the team until at least the end of the 2025 season making it one of the longeststanding driver contracts on the grid. Norris said at the time there had been little chats here and there with other teams before he signed his new McLaren deal but that nothing went far. Asked by Autosport about the talks with Norris Red Bull team principal Horner said Weve spoken to Lando a couple of times over the years. But every time weve had a conversation the next day hes signed a contract with McLaren. Hes on a longterm contract with McLaren and it looks like hes going to be there for a few more years. Back in 2018 Red Bulls sister team Toro Rosso was interested in signing Norris when he was racing in F2 prior to McLaren confirming the Briton would be making the step up to F1 the following year. Norris expanded on his comments about the Red Bull talks over the Mexico Grand Prix weekend saying his longterm McLaren deal was not in reaction to the talks with Red Bull. Christian Horner Team Principal Red Bull Racing congratulates Lando Norris McLaren 3rd position in Parc Ferme Photo by Mark Sutton  Motorsport Images It was more just when it came to the end of my contract and it wasnt like we were talking heavily said Norris. Everyone always tries to speak to all teams at some point so it was just that I spoke to them. I spoke to a few other people. But like a chance to chat. Its not like you know what can we do straightaway. Just keeping in touch things like that. Its as simple as that sometimes. I was just coming to the end of the contract when you see like what options are available you just kind of find out whats possible what might be possible over the next few years. It wasnt just Red Bull. Every driver has chats with a lot of different teams on what could happen. Simple as that basically. Following his F1 graduation in 2019 Norris signed subsequent deals with McLaren in May 2021 and in February of this year and clarified in Mexico that he had always been happy with the team. Before Ive ever spoken to anyone else my talks have always been with McLaren first said Norris. Its always how it goes. The best thing for me is signing the contract that I have now just having that confidence and knowledge that youre going to be in Formula 1 for whatever three four or five years. For me thats like the best feeling. It makes you more relaxed more comfortable in the environment youre in. So thats the best of all of it.

Formula 1 is far too busy with the now and looks far too little at the possibilities of the future. Vettel critical of the organisationTherefore in the interview Vettel decides to give Formula 1 a slap on the wrist. The veteran driver who is retiring from the sport after this season finds it unjustifiable that it takes several years to address the problems.

The German believes the organisation is waiting too long to take steps and therefore hopes for change in the future he told Der Spiegel. Article continues under ad The motorsport class is revamping the engine regulations in the 2026 season. These new rules should ensure that Formula 1 becomes more sustainable and therefore moves with the times. Although Vettel supports the plans he actually thinks it is too little and too late. I think 2026 is too late to see it as pioneering. Synthetic fuels already exist so why wait another four years he argues. Formula 1 is far too busy with the now and looks far too little at the possibilities of the future. It is busy expanding instead of being a pacesetter for tomorrows mobility with foresight. Vettel critical of the organisation Therefore in the interview Vettel decides to give Formula 1 a slap on the wrist. The veteran driver who is retiring from the sport after this season finds it unjustifiable that it takes several years to address the problems. I find it a bit embarrassing. E10 has been available at the petrol station for more than a decade. I see synthetic fuels more as a bridging technology because producing them requires a lot of renewable energy. This energy can be better used for heating and hot water.
IndyCar's F1-testing duo see a superlicence 'blockage', https://the-race.com/formula-1/indycars-f1-testing-duo-see-a-superlicence-blockage/, The two latest IndyCar drivers to appear in Formula 1 sessions both admit they have qualms about the FIA superlicence system. Asked if IndyCar should be represented better Palou said Yeah but I dont think thats going to change at all. OWard has been outspoken on the superlicence situation before and labelled IndyCar underrated in a recent interview with The Race. Because I feel like theres a lot of opportunities that have been wasted because of having a blockage of superlicence. When confirming that Herta did not qualify for a superlicence this year it reiterated it continuously reviews regulations and procedures including with respect to superlicence eligibility., The two latest IndyCar drivers to appear in Formula 1 sessions both admit they have qualms about the FIA superlicence system. Alex Palou drove for McLaren in FP1 at the United States Grand Prix last month and already has a superlicence supplemented by his 2021 IndyCar title. M c Laren stars new attitude towards his F1 dream Read more However Pato OWard  due to drive in Abu Dhabi FP1 also for McLaren  does not have a superlicence despite finishing fourth third and seventh in the last three IndyCar championships while winning four races  the same number as Palou  in the last two seasons. And with both drivers routes to IndyCar having been unusual in themselves  with both diverting via Super Formula in Japan OWard also a sportscar racer and very briefly a Red Bull junior and Palou struggling for budget in European singleseaters  OWard believes theyre also examples of how random the superlicence points situation can become for anyone deviating from the F1 support bill norm. The superlicence systems perceived shortcomings were highlighted by fellow IndyCar driver Colton Hertas plight earlier this year as he tried to gain dispensation to take up a seat AlphaTauri wanted to give him but a lack of intervention from the FIA meant Herta had to forego the seat now taken by Nyck de Vries. Currently the IndyCar champion gets 40 points  the same as for winning F2  but while F2 offers 40 points for second and third which is still enough for an F1 superlicence IndyCars points scale decreases dramatically. The American series gets 30 points for second 20 for third 10 for fourth and eight for fifth. OWard earned just four points for his seventhplace finish this year despite the competitiveness of the series and his season which was hampered by reliability issues despite a record that included qualifying in the top six on every road course and a seriesequalling best average starting position alongside his impressive win tally. The systems quirks have been exposed further this year as Linus Lundqvist  the Indy Lights champion who won the heavilyweighted Formula Regional Americas title in 2020  has qualified for a superlicence via racing on the junior ladder before he has even raced in IndyCar. Asked if IndyCar should be represented better Palou said Yeah but I dont think thats going to change at all. Obviously I have my superlicence. Im happy so I dont care what happens. But obviously I think its very unfair that theres some series that they dont get enough licence points  like Pato doesnt have and he finished third in the championship fourth in the championship and fifth or seventh. A guy that is like that doing 17 weekends racing against people that have 10 or 15 years of experience in IndyCar  that guy is capable of doing a lot in F1. But thats the rules. So hopefully they change it in the future. But I understand that also the FIA they want everybody to go through Europe and through other places. But its true that you could get more points by racing in I dont know a winter series in Thailand and winning that an Asian F3 title is 10 points than finishing fifth in IndyCar eight points. Thats a bit like I dont know if thats fair or not. OWards superlicence situation came back to haunt him in 2019 when Red Bull gambled on adding him to its junior programme  for which he gave up a Carlin IndyCar deal  due to its belief he had enough points for a superlicence. But with the number of competitors in some of the categories namely IMSA Prototype Challenge and Indy Lights that wouldve qualified him for points having been below the FIA requirement he was actually short of the required 40  and while Red Bull appeared willing to keep OWard on for another season he ultimately elected to take up McLarens offer to race for its newlyformed IndyCar team for 2020 where he immediately impressed. OWard has been outspoken on the superlicence situation before and labelled IndyCar underrated in a recent interview with The Race. I think as a driver and I think many others not just me in IndyCar have proven to be capable of being in Formula 1 deserve the shot to be Formula 1 and would be competitive in Formula 1 OWard said. And sadly IndyCar is very underrated. We all need to work as a community to fix that. Because I feel like theres a lot of opportunities that have been wasted because of having a blockage of superlicence. I think massive talents like Max Verstappen who is arguably the best driver on the grid right now he wouldnt have been able to come to Formula 1 if it was for the superlicence. And I think like Fernando Alonso wouldnt have either Kimi Raikkonen wouldnt have either. I get that they want to have something that qualifies you for it. But I really think that theres many qualified drivers that should have the shot and should have the chance to go into Formula 1 and and they dont because of that. I hope its something thats addressed. We all know how hard it is to win in IndyCar and how competitive it is. And anybody thats contending in IndyCar I believe deserves a shot in Formula 1. Or at least the chance right If a team decides to give it to them. OWard added that he thinks drivers who have unusual resumes such as his shouldnt be punished for sampling many championships when it comes to superlicence qualification. Not everyones career is going to be a perfect upbringing because not everybody has millions and millions to spend in order to get to Formula 1 he said. My career and many others have been insane. Japan Mexico prototypes America Europe its super diverse. But a lot of times when its diverse you dont complete championships certain things just happen because you dont have the funding to continue or just stuff like that. And its just a shame because I feel like theres a lot of lost talents that deserve a shot if a team decides to give it to them. But then they cant because of something else in the way. The FIAs superlicence system has not been inflexible since its introduction with the governing body having made changes to championships point allocations. It even made allowances for the impact of the COVID19 pandemic on drivers careers. When confirming that Herta did not qualify for a superlicence this year it reiterated it continuously reviews regulations and procedures including with respect to superlicence eligibility.
‘I always believed in the project’ – Max Verstappen on Red Bull his second title and how long he plans to race in F1, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.i-always-believed-in-the-project-max-verstappen-on-red-bull-his-second-title.7mbvN7HjprbEf3VGYDKFzM.html, Though it is now under the Red Bull Powertrains banner courtesy of a brandnew division and huge investment from the energy drinks firm Honda continue to play an integral role  and its their constant development from one year to the next that has given Red Bull the grunt to fight at the sharp end. With the regulations more or less staying the same for the coming years we can take advantage of that. He adds Red Bull are my second family they were already world champions before I joined. We had a bit of a tough time at the start but I always believed in the project. And thats helped us make that final jump that we were missing to fight for a title. Verstappens second title has been impressive for different reasons. Verstappen described Red Bull as his second family and believes they can be successful for yearsThe first one was very emotional because you realise you have achieved everything in the sport you wanted to achieve he says., With pack up well under way at Suzuka on Sunday night Max Verstappen took five minutes to sit down with those closest in his team open a beer and reflect on what he had just achieved  the defence of his Formula 1 world title. There would not be much time to celebrate that night as he had already planned to fly back home so he could maximise the hours with his family and friends before the following race in Austin. Between a string of interviews  including one with us for broadcasters  there was only really time for a quick team photo debrief and short calls with his father and then his mother. READ MORE Hes been perfect  Horner full of praise after Verstappens recordbreaking victory Racing drivers dont tend to dwell on success. The focus is always on what is next. Youre only as good as your next lap. But in those five minutes Verstappen gave himself the chance to take it all in. This has been a remarkable season  one which after three races saw the now twotime world champion 46 points adrift in the championship hunt courtesy of two mechanicalrelated retirements. But he then went on a run of 13 wins in 17 races smashing the record of most wins in a year 14 with two races still to go. Victory in Mexico also set a record of the most points in a year 416. Its been an incredible season says Verstappen. As a whole team we definitely didnt expect something like this. We had a competitive start but we retired two times in three. It was not the best start to try and defend the title. After that we had a great turnaround  we kept on pushing kept on believing kept on improving the car which was the most important area. It is why we are here today. As a team we made very few mistakes. You cant be perfect but for most of the races we have been close to perfect. Verstappen and Red Bulls season did not get off to the best start after two retirements in the first three races  including in Australia Though Red Bull failed to win a title between 2014 and 2020 they remained operationally shrewd throughout and alongside building a mighty car for the newfor2022 regulations that has been one of the fundamental reasons they have been so relentlessly successful this year. Another has been the power unit in the back of the car. Though it is now under the Red Bull Powertrains banner courtesy of a brandnew division and huge investment from the energy drinks firm Honda continue to play an integral role  and its their constant development from one year to the next that has given Red Bull the grunt to fight at the sharp end. READ MORE I never thought Id be able to win 14 races in a year says recordbreaker Verstappen in Mexico Working together with Honda has been incredible and is incredible and they definitely deserve it that weve won it on their own track added Verstappen at Suzuka. Thanks goes out to the whole team back at the factory and those contributing to the powertrains division. They have been working flatout nobody is lacking motivation  and thats how I like to see. Verstappen himself has been key to their success. Having joined the team back in 2016 winning a race on debut with them in Barcelona he has set about building a dynasty that is showing shoots similar to that of Michael Schumacher at Ferrari Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes and Sebastian Vettel before him at Red Bull. But he knows its more than just about him  its about the people around him and how everyone gels together to work towards the same goal. Verstappen has been key to Red Bulls return to success after joining in 2016 and winning his first race for the team in Spain That building something special is what were trying to do he says. With the regulations more or less staying the same for the coming years we can take advantage of that. He adds Red Bull are my second family they were already world champions before I joined. We had a bit of a tough time at the start but I always believed in the project. The whole team we have  back at the factory designing the car combined with the powertrain division  we have a really great group of people who I think can be successful for quite a few years. TOP 10 We rank the best drives of double world champion Verstappens F1 career so far It goes higher up than me to make sure we find the right people and putting them into the right position. What is most important is that everyone gets on well and everyone understands their role. Honda and now coming into our own powertrains division its about understanding how to work together. Implementing the two together has been really strong the last few years. And thats helped us make that final jump that we were missing to fight for a title. Verstappens second title has been impressive for different reasons. Last year he fought tooth and nail to the seasonending race and clinched the title on the final lap of the season edging out Lewis Hamilton. This year after a slow start he has gone on an extraordinary run of form that has made the title a formality. Its no wonder then that each championship feels different. Verstappen described Red Bull as his second family and believes they can be successful for years The first one was very emotional because you realise you have achieved everything in the sport you wanted to achieve he says. The second one because of the season we have had is probably more rewarding. Its very different feelings which I think is great because it would be a little bit boring if they are the same. READ MORE I was there when Jolyon Palmer Will Buxton Mark Hughes and more reflect on Max Verstappen milestones Winning that first title had a positive effect on Verstappen in that it made him more relaxed and has seen him pull back on his allout attacking approach by the smallest of margins. In doing so it has also made him a more potent force. Make no mistake having an incredible car with a team working efficiently in terms of operations and strategy has made life easier  but hes still had to get the job done. You grow as a person every year you learn a lot from every single year what has happened at every single race you try to improve as a driver he says. I dont think you improve in terms of raw speed but because of the experiences you have had in the past you try to put that into play. In some tricky situations sometimes that can help you out because of the previous experiences you have. Verstappen has appeared a lot more relaxed behind the wheel this season after winning his first championship

Though it is now under the Red Bull Powertrains banner courtesy of a brandnew division and huge investment from the energy drinks firm Honda continue to play an integral role  and its their constant development from one year to the next that has given Red Bull the grunt to fight at the sharp end. READ MORE I never thought Id be able to win 14 races in a year says recordbreaker Verstappen in Mexico Working together with Honda has been incredible and is incredible and they definitely deserve it that weve won it on their own track added Verstappen at Suzuka. Thanks goes out to the whole team back at the factory and those contributing to the powertrains division. They have been working flatout nobody is lacking motivation  and thats how I like to see. Verstappen himself has been key to their success. Having joined the team back in 2016 winning a race on debut with them in Barcelona he has set about building a dynasty that is showing shoots similar to that of Michael Schumacher at Ferrari Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes and Sebastian Vettel before him at Red Bull. But he knows its more than just about him  its about the people around him and how everyone gels together to work towards the same goal. Verstappen has been key to Red Bulls return to success after joining in 2016 and winning his first race for the team in Spain That building something special is what were trying to do he says. With the regulations more or less staying the same for the coming years we can take advantage of that. He adds Red Bull are my second family they were already world champions before I joined. We had a bit of a tough time at the start but I always believed in the project. The whole team we have  back at the factory designing the car combined with the powertrain division  we have a really great group of people who I think can be successful for quite a few years. TOP 10 We rank the best drives of double world champion Verstappens F1 career so far It goes higher up than me to make sure we find the right people and putting them into the right position. What is most important is that everyone gets on well and everyone understands their role. Honda and now coming into our own powertrains division its about understanding how to work together. Implementing the two together has been really strong the last few years. And thats helped us make that final jump that we were missing to fight for a title. Verstappens second title has been impressive for different reasons. Last year he fought tooth and nail to the seasonending race and clinched the title on the final lap of the season edging out Lewis Hamilton. This year after a slow start he has gone on an extraordinary run of form that has made the title a formality. Its no wonder then that each championship feels different. Verstappen described Red Bull as his second family and believes they can be successful for years The first one was very emotional because you realise you have achieved everything in the sport you wanted to achieve he says. The second one because of the season we have had is probably more rewarding. Its very different feelings which I think is great because it would be a little bit boring if they are the same. READ MORE I was there when Jolyon Palmer Will Buxton Mark Hughes and more reflect on Max Verstappen milestones Winning that first title had a positive effect on Verstappen in that it made him more relaxed and has seen him pull back on his allout attacking approach by the smallest of margins. In doing so it has also made him a more potent force. Make no mistake having an incredible car with a team working efficiently in terms of operations and strategy has made life easier  but hes still had to get the job done. You grow as a person every year you learn a lot from every single year what has happened at every single race you try to improve as a driver he says. I dont think you improve in terms of raw speed but because of the experiences you have had in the past you try to put that into play. In some tricky situations sometimes that can help you out because of the previous experiences you have. Verstappen has appeared a lot more relaxed behind the wheel this season after winning his first championship

Hamilton was memorably involved in a tense battle for the title with Max Verstappen during the last campaign but lost out on the World Championship in the controversial final laps of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. In 2022 Mercedes have been unable to match the pace of rivals Red Bull and Ferrari and unless Hamilton achieves a victory in the final two races of the year it will mark the seventime World Champions first season in which he has not claimed a win. Hamiltons current contract with the Silver Arrows expires at the end of 2023 but he recently voiced his intention to remain with the team beyond then.

Bottas thinks that this shows that drivers can still achieve in the sport at different ages. Obviously every drivers individual the 10time race winner said. I think its a lot up to you if you still want it if you still want to be competitive you can.
Will Alfa Romeo join forces with Haas in F1 2024?, https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1016277/1/will-alfa-romeo-join-forces-haas-f1-2024, Alfa Romeo have already announced their deal with Sauber comes to an end in 2023 paving way for Audis full takeover of the team in the subsequent years. However the Alfa Romeo name could be sticking around beyond next year according to reputable journalist Dieter Rencken. According to his report Alfa Romeo want to remain in F1 with Haas potentially the perfect fit for the Italian brand. Haas tricky history with sponsorsHaas were forced to drop Russian sponsor Uralkali ahead of the 2022 season. The partnership ultimately ended at the 2019 British Grand Prix after Rich Energy grew frustrated with Haas competitiveness., Alfa Romeo have already announced their deal with Sauber comes to an end in 2023 paving way for Audis full takeover of the team in the subsequent years. However the Alfa Romeo name could be sticking around beyond next year according to reputable journalist Dieter Rencken. According to his report Alfa Romeo want to remain in F1 with Haas potentially the perfect fit for the Italian brand. Recently Haas acquired a new title sponsor in the form of Moneygram reportedly worth 20 million per year. With Moneygrams colour scheme matching Alfa Romeos  red white and black colours  theres certainly some logic to it. Haas new sponsorship deal is an important one for the American outfit allowing them to push towards the F1 cost cap for the first time. They are on course for their best finish in the constructors championship for a number of years sitting in eighth overall with two rounds remaining. Haas tricky history with sponsors Haas were forced to drop Russian sponsor Uralkali ahead of the 2022 season. The company was coowned by Nikita Mazepins father Dmitry Mazepin. Haas opted to cut ties with Uralkali and their driver Mazepin due to Russias invasion of Ukraine. In more bizarre circumstances Rich Energy were their sponsors in 2019. Vocal on social media CEO William Storey had big ambitions for Haas and his energy drinks company wanting to take on Red Bull. The partnership ultimately ended at the 2019 British Grand Prix after Rich Energy grew frustrated with Haas competitiveness. Although theres always been a degree of uncertainty and mystery behind the legitimacy of Rich Energys finances and business as a whole.

Magnussen: “No problem" with Hulkenberg as 2023 F1 teammate, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/magnussen-no-problem-hulkenberg-2023-teammate/10395329/, The choice of Hulkenberg is intriguing because he and Magnussen who is under contract for 2023 have had their moments of controversy in the past. Most famously back at the 2017 Hungarian Grand Prix Magnussen told Hulkenberg to suck my balls after they came to verbal blows following a laterace battle for a pointsscoring position. But with Magnussen and Hulkenberg having long moved on from that moment there is unlikely to be any lingering tensions. And Magnussen himself is clear that having someone alongside him with the kind of experience that Hulkenberg has would be a positive thing. I think Ive said many times now that I dont have a problem with Nico at all said the Dane., Listen to this article Haas is currently weighing up its driver options for the second seat in 2023 with it believed to be a straight call between retaining Mick Schumacher or going for the more experienced Hulkenberg. The choice of Hulkenberg is intriguing because he and Magnussen who is under contract for 2023 have had their moments of controversy in the past. Most famously back at the 2017 Hungarian Grand Prix Magnussen told Hulkenberg to suck my balls after they came to verbal blows following a laterace battle for a pointsscoring position.

And Magnussen himself is clear that having someone alongside him with the kind of experience that Hulkenberg has would be a positive thing. I think Ive said many times now that I dont have a problem with Nico at all said the Dane. Actually I respect him as a racing driver. I dont really know him as a person. But certainly as a racing driver Ive always respected him. So I would have no problem. But I dont have an opinion on whether or not he should be in the second car. Mick is doing a good job at the moment. He had some issues in the beginning of the year and a few crashes but he is certainly faster now. Mick Schumacher Haas VF22 Kevin Magnussen Haas VF22 Photo by Steven Tee  Motorsport Images Hulkenberg has most recently been an F1 supersub and was last called up by Aston Martin to fill in for the unwell Sebastian Vettel at the Bahrain and Saudi Arabian Grands Prix. Speculation about him moving to Haas ramped up earlier this week when it emerged that Aston had signed Stoffel Vandoorne as a reserve for 2023. Speaking to Servus TV over the Mexican GP weekend Hulkenberg said he was upbeat about the progress of talks with Haas even if nothing was finalised. At the end of the day its not my decision he said. Im not making it. There are still talks going on. Im relatively optimistic but well have to be a little patient there. Schumacher is aware that time is running out for him to impress his Haas bosses enough to convince them to keep him for 2023. But he says it is pointless getting distracted by things that he cannot control so his sole focus is on delivering crucial points. Im here to do my job and Im here to do it well he said in Mexico. So thats what my main focus is on and thats everything that Im in control of. Im just trying to do my best and thats what Im here for.

This is De Vries' new manager on entering debut Formula 1 season, https://www.gpblog.com/en/news/154672/this-is-de-vries-new-manager-on-entering-debut-formula-1-season.html, Nyck de Vries has revealed in conversation with Ziggo Sport that he will have his interests looked after by Guillaume le Goff from this point onwards. The Frenchman has been Pierre Gaslys manager for several years and will therefore also take De Vries under his wing. Le Goff is mainly expected to take many tasks off his hands. De Vries never felt the need for a manager because he wants to be directly connected in the team. Now however the time has come so De Vries has enlisted help from outside in the person of Le Goff., Nyck de Vries has revealed in conversation with Ziggo Sport that he will have his interests looked after by Guillaume le Goff from this point onwards. The Frenchman has been Pierre Gaslys manager for several years and will therefore also take De Vries under his wing. Previously the Dutchman did not have a manager. Article continues under ad His contract negotiations with AlphaTauri for the 2023 contract were therefore done entirely by De Vries himself. Next year as a rookie in the premier class there will be more demands on the 27yearold driver than ever so De Vries will be working with a manager for the first time. Le Goff is mainly expected to take many tasks off his hands. From now on I do have help from a management as it were. Personally I dont really like using that term because I still very much value my relationship between the team and myself. Nothing will change in that either but I do now have help from Guillaume le Goff who relieves me of everything De Vries told Jack Plooij in conversation. De Vries never felt the need for a manager because he wants to be directly connected in the team. He considers that important for personal relationships and a manager in between does not have a positive influence on that according to the upcoming AlphaTauri driver. Now however the time has come so De Vries has enlisted help from outside in the person of Le Goff. Read more Departure of De Vries and Vandoorne opens door for Ricciardo at Mercedes
F1-backed female series ‘only a positive’ says W Series driver Hawkins, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/f1-female-series-positive-hawkins/10395055/, The F1backed female series would not be designed to replace W Series given it will use Formula 4 machinery and be targeted at a younger generation of drivers. W Series has used Formula 3 cars since its inaugural season in 2019. Hawkins has raced in all three seasons of W Series to date as well as serving as an ambassador for Aston Martins Formula 1 team. I also would like to think that it would work alongside W Series. W Series has helped make that happen but were just a bit later on., Listen to this article Over the United States Grand Prix weekend last month it emerged that F1 was planning to launch its own allfemale racing series as early as next year serving as a potential feeder series into Formula 3 and Formula 2. It came just weeks after W Series was forced to call off the final three rounds of its 2022 season due to fundraising issues instead turning its attention to securing back for the 2023 championship. The F1backed female series would not be designed to replace W Series given it will use Formula 4 machinery and be targeted at a younger generation of drivers. W Series has used Formula 3 cars since its inaugural season in 2019. Hawkins has raced in all three seasons of W Series to date as well as serving as an ambassador for Aston Martins Formula 1 team. Although F1 is yet to formally confirm any details for its planned series Hawkins said she can only see it as a positive as it gives more racing opportunities to women trying to get up the ladder. Any championship that helps females out I think should be welcomed and we should do everything that we can to welcome it said Hawkins. I also would like to think that it would work alongside W Series. I would hate to think they would ever be competing against each other because thats not what were fight for here. Its not whos got the best championship its how do we work together because were all trying to achieve the same thing. I think its a positive thing. Start grid Photo by Sam Bloxham  Motorsport Images Hawkins felt it was important for a greater focus on grassroots level to get more women racing helping increase the pool of drivers and had a wider impact similar to the England womens football team that won the Euro 2022 championship. The less that we have the less chance there is going to be that a female is going to be making it to Formula 1 said Hawkins. So lets address the issue get as many in as we can appeal to the younger generation get as many as we can in at grassroots level and in a few years time well see the reward of that like the Lionesses. Yes were seeing the reward of the amazing work that the current Lionesses are doing. But were actually gaining from the work that was done five 10 15 years ago. The Lionesses could have won the Euros 20 years ago but I bet no one would have heard about it. But because of the work that was done by those 20 years ago now were enjoying it and hearing about it so much. W Series has helped make that happen but were just a bit later on. Were going to see the reward of that in a few years time.

Is Hamilton No Longer the Best Wet Weather Driver Video of Is Hamilton No Longer the Best Wet Weather Driver In terms of my physical wellbeing I feel the best Ive physically ever been because Ive been really focused on that as you get older Hamilton said. Im generally loving driving so Im working on a plan. I cant tell you what that is just yet but there is no limit to what we can do I want to be creative and continue to do all the other things I get to do. I get to be myself at this team  and the support from Mercedes has been incredible since day one. Together its not just about winning we can be part of the many people in the world that are trying to change the world for the better  and thats what we can try and do together as its a huge brand that can have a huge influence on the world. Hamilton sits fifth in the F1 standings and with two races left in 2022 is facing the first winless season of his esteemed career. George Russell his teammate is fourth. Hamilton said In terms of George joining he was one of the younger drivers  he would sit behind in debriefs and engineering so he knows the process and the lay of the land here. He comes in and slots in he knows what to expect. And from my side Ive just tried to be as welcoming and include him  trying to communicate a lot about the car what can I test what can you test to get us to point A I just try to work with him as I did with Valtteri Bottas. When you add new people it takes time to all get into the rhythm but I think hes done an amazing job we got into a decent rhythm quite early on and were continuing to work out any kinks there to continue to be on that rhythm. Hamilton has vowed to return to the title fight in 2023 and challenge Max Verstappen again.

Ferrari: Mercedes’ development rate not a worry for F1 2023, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/ferrari-mercedes-development-rate-not-a-worry-for-f1-2023/10395092/, While the Italian squad started the 2022 season as the team to beat it eventually lost out to the fastrecovering Red Bull team which has claimed both the drivers and constructors championship titles. More recently Mercedes has emerged as Red Bulls main threat at some races with Ferraris F175 particularly lacking performance last time out in Mexico. That could leave Ferrari facing another season of disappointment having failed to capitalise on having the best package at the start of this year. We know as well ourselves that we stopped quite early the development of that car to focus on 2023. Since then Red Bull has won every grand prix., While the Italian squad started the 2022 season as the team to beat it eventually lost out to the fastrecovering Red Bull team which has claimed both the drivers and constructors championship titles. More recently Mercedes has emerged as Red Bulls main threat at some races with Ferraris F175 particularly lacking performance last time out in Mexico. This has come with Mercedes overcoming the early bouncing problems that plagued its W13 and being able to finally unlock the potential it knew was always in the car. Mercedes progress points to the team being back in contention for wins next year as it looks poised to switch some key concepts of its challenger. That could leave Ferrari facing another season of disappointment having failed to capitalise on having the best package at the start of this year. But Ferrari team principal Binotto thinks the current competitive picture between his outfit and Mercedes does not reflect the true situation for next year as Maranello switched off development of its 2022 car early to shift its focus to next year. Mercedes is coming back right as they have developed the car more than we did he said after Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc finished fifth and sixth in Mexico. We know as well ourselves that we stopped quite early the development of that car to focus on 2023. So Im not too concerned by the rate of development because I know as well when we stopped developing it. Ferrari has not won a race since the Austrian Grand Prix in July when Leclerc came through to beat Max Verstappen. Since then Red Bull has won every grand prix.

Certainly if I look at the last races it has not always been great but in Singapore I think we have been very competitive he said. Japan was in the wet and we were not as fast but it was not a drama and certainly not in the quali. In the States Austin I think that in the quali we were competitive but not as much as we would have expected in the race. In Mexico its a lot worse but I dont think its the same trend because Singapore competitive Japan not too bad USA good quali. But the duty is first to try to analyse whats going on and what has been the main issues here in Mexico and try to be back competitive for what is our level of competitiveness at least for the last two races including Sao Paulo. So we hope certainly to be there and to fight for a better result.
‘There’s no limit to what we can do’ – Hamilton on fighting back ‘best friend’ Wolff and changing the world, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.theres-no-limit-to-what-we-can-do-hamilton-on-fighting-back-best-friend.6G5Be1bYJ4AzCkYAmrv0BH.html, I cant tell you what that is just yet but there is no limit to what we can do. I get to be myself at this team  and the support from Mercedes has been incredible since day one. Toto Wolff Mercedes Team Principal is one of my best friends. Its with that in mind Hamilton is focusing on all the details he can control  and working with the team to drive them forward. Hamilton remains as motivated as ever to claim what would be a recordbreaking eighth world title, Lewis Hamilton is a force of nature. The Briton has had the most challenging 12 months of his career a period which began with missing out on what would have been a record eighth world title on the final lap of the final race of 2021 and could end with him enduring the first winless campaign of his illustrious career. And yet he is not letting it get him down. Rather than pondering an exit and calling it quits the losses are only serving to reenergise him as he considers the next chapter. READ MORE Hamilton targeting multiyear contract renewal with Mercedes In terms of my physical wellbeing I feel the best Ive physically ever been because Ive been really focused on that as you get older says Hamilton when we sit down before lunch in the Mercedes motorhome. Im generally loving driving so Im working on a plan. I cant tell you what that is just yet but there is no limit to what we can do. I want to be creative and continue to do all the other things I get to do. I get to be myself at this team  and the support from Mercedes has been incredible since day one. Together its not just about winning we can be part of the many people in the world that are trying to change the world for the better  and thats what we can try and do together as its a huge brand that can have a huge influence on the world. Hamilton is determined to leave his mark on and off the track Given Hamilton is in his happy place with Mercedes its no surprise he is in talks to extend his stay at the Silver Arrows with a multiyear deal. The 37yearold is currently in his 10th season with the Mercedes works team and 16th in total in F1 as the German manufacturer supplied power to Hamiltons first team McLaren. Extending given they give him so much freedom  from what he wears to what he does away from the track  and support particularly on causes that hes keen to use his platform to give a voice to makes sense. READ MORE We know where we need to improve says Hamilton after P2 in Mexico He also gets on well with the boss too. Toto Wolff Mercedes Team Principal is one of my best friends. Weve had tough tough times weve had tough negotiations theres been emotional bursts a rollercoaster of emotions together over the years but were like family. I want whats best for him. He wants what is best for me. We always can jump on the phone and talk about whatever that is. Our values are aligned and our goals are aligned  in the brand in helping this team grow and what it wants to achieve. Hamilton has formed a close relationship with Wolff over the years Hamilton has quickly formed a strong partnership with his team mate George Russell a Mercedes junior who earned promotion after three years at Williams including a super sub performance for Hamilton at Mercedes in Bahrain back in 2020. It could have been awkward the young pretender coming in alongside the veteran one year after his run of utter domination came to an end courtesy of Max Verstappen and Red Bull. But instead faced with the least competitive Silver Arrows car Brackley and Brixworth have produced since the hybrid turbo era began they have worked together for the greater good  with Hamilton playing an active role helping his fellow Briton hit the ground running. In terms of George joining he was one of the younger drivers here  he would sit behind in debriefs and engineering so he knows the process and the lay of the land here says Hamilton. READ MORE In hindsight its always easier  Wolff defends Mercedes Mexico strategy as wait for 2022 win goes on He comes in and slots in he knows what to expect. And from my side Ive just tried to be as welcoming and include him  trying to communicate a lot about the car what can I test what can you test to get us to point A I just try to work with him as I did with Valtteri. When you add new people it takes time to all get into the rhythm but I think hes done an amazing job we got into a decent rhythm quite early on and were continuing to work out any kinks there to continue to be on that rhythm. Hamilton and Russell have combined to score 15 podiums so far this season despite Mercedes struggles The longer Hamilton has been in F1 the more hes found stuff to do away from the sport  from setting up his own foundation Mission 44 to help young people from underrepresented background to becoming a coowner for NFL team Denver Broncos. But rather than taking his eye off the main prize in trying to achieve the balance hes actively enhanced his approach to tackling a race weekend at track to ensure the day job doesnt suffer and remains top priority. I shifted my weekend rhythm from years ago he says. These four days Thursday through to race day on Sunday Im only here for one reason. Thats not how you speak in the media or its not how youre seen but its how you show up its the work youre doing on track how youre driving on the track how you get the car to be the best it can be and how you can be the best you can be. PALMER Could Mercedes have beaten Verstappen in Mexico City with bolder calls from the pit wall So I try to use up all the time and the quietest part of the day particularly is the end of the day as no one is around and thats where I have no distractions. I can go through the data  and Im in constant contact with the simulation team back at the factory so while that is running Im able to have live interactions with the driver who is driving there. Hamilton and Mercedes are still pushing for their first win of 2022 having come close in the United States and Mexico I eat at the track and then Im depleted once I finish. Im starting to wind down at the end head back to the hotel and then its a short time between going to sleep and waking up  so thats what I like. I dont want to finish here early and go to dinner. I have no desire to go to dinner and waste time yapping. Im here for one reason thats to win races. That dinner and other events not linked to racing during a race weekend for me is all the distraction so I dont do that very often  if ever. To win races though Mercedes will need to turn things around for next year after a difficult season that has left the Silver Arrows trailing Red Bull and Ferrari by quite some way. TREMAYNE Mercedes resurgence means we could be in for a thrilling end to 2022 Positively for Hamilton and co they have closed the gap in recent races  pulling themselves into the fight for victory at both Austin and Mexico  but the seventime world champion knows they still have plenty to do if they are to recapture the form that led to Mercedes dominating F1 from 2014 to 2020. Its with that in mind Hamilton is focusing on all the details he can control  and working with the team to drive them forward. Hamilton remains as motivated as ever to claim what would be a recordbreaking eighth world title

Ricciardo reveals help from psychologist - “I was neglecting friendships”, https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1016199/1/ricciardo-reveals-help-psychologist-i-was-neglecting-friendships, The veteran Australian has now revealed how his ontrack struggles followed him in his personal life too.  F1 2022 Video of Daniel Ricciardo  WHERE NEXT  F1 2022Whenever we thought we would found a solution along would come another set of challenges he told the Daily Mail. I was neglecting friendships and thought it would be good to talk to someone to make sure the two sides of my life didnt cross over. It would be good to get next year sorted before the final race in Abu Dhabi he said., Ricciardo wont be in the F1 2023 driver lineup after McLaren opted to terminate his contract a year early and replace him with rookie Oscar Piastri as a result of his poor form. The veteran Australian has now revealed how his ontrack struggles followed him in his personal life too. Daniel Ricciardo  WHERE NEXT  F1 2022 Video of Daniel Ricciardo  WHERE NEXT  F1 2022 Whenever we thought we would found a solution along would come another set of challenges he told the Daily Mail. When you put so much into something and it doesnt work out there is sadness. It gets to you. Last year it affected me a little bit too much. I wouldnt be my usual bubbly self. I would be reluctant if someone said lets go out for dinner. I would need some cajoling. I let it get to me. I started to speak to a psychologist last year. The most challenging year I have had. Racing is very much results driven and dictates your Sunday happiness. I was neglecting friendships and thought it would be good to talk to someone to make sure the two sides of my life didnt cross over. You need perspective. And with the calendar being so long it was hard to remove yourself from what was happening in the racing. Ricciardo is 12th in the F1 standings after being drastically outperformed by Lando Norris in 2022. McLaren opted not to keep him for 2023 and he has not found an agreement to stay on the grid with another team. It is fair to say it was unexpected given I was on a threeyear deal that had a year to run he said about McLarens decision. It is not something you can prepare for. But Id already had some honest discussions with Andreas Seidl team principal and Zak Brown chief executive earlier in the year to see what we could do to improve things. It was a concern on both sides. I didnt want to keep coming 14th or 15th. I kept the faith that something would click. But it hadnt happened by midseason and they took the decision they did. It put me in a tough position of thinking What next Ricciardo has confirmed that he remains in talks with F1 teams about a different role reportedly as a reserve driver. He has been heavily linked with Mercedes as backup to Lewis Hamilton and George Russell. It would be good to get next year sorted before the final race in Abu Dhabi he said.
Lewis Hamilton snubbed again as Sebastian Vettel changes his mind on F1 GOAT debate, https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/f1-goat-hamilton-schumacher-vettel-28414447, Michael is my hero for that reason I probably dont want Lewis to win he said last December. In a way I would be happy if Michaels record still stands but even if Lewis wins to me Michael is still the greatest. Lewis can win one more two more three more five more championships  it doesnt change anything for me. Asked again for his verdict on that most controversial of questions Vettel now believes the GOAT to be fivetime champion Juan Manuel Fangio. Im a fan of Michael Schumacher but Fangio is a little better... the best the best the king said Vettel., Vettel previously named Michael Schumacher as the best F1 driver of all time in his opinion but it seems he has since changed his mind while still ignoring Hamilton Sebastian Vettel has changed his mind on who he believes to be the Formula 1 GOAT  but like last time he avoided choosing Lewis Hamilton. The fourtime world champion knows more than most what it takes to be among the F1 elite. Vettel will retire later this month as one of the most decorated racers the sport has ever seen boasting 53 race wins and 112 podiums as well as those four consecutive drivers titles. Last year on the eve of the titledeciding Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Vettel made it clear who he believed to be the greatest driver the sport has ever seen. No matter whether or not Hamilton got the better of Max Verstappen last year he still advocated for his countryman Michael Schumacher. Michael is my hero for that reason I probably dont want Lewis to win he said last December. But the truth is they both had a strong season and they are going into the last race with the opportunity to win the championship because they both deserve it. In a way I would be happy if Michaels record still stands but even if Lewis wins to me Michael is still the greatest. Lewis can win one more two more three more five more championships  it doesnt change anything for me. Those comments made clear his unwavering belief in that point of view but it seems something may have changed over the last 12 months. Asked again for his verdict on that most controversial of questions Vettel now believes the GOAT to be fivetime champion Juan Manuel Fangio. Image Mirrorpix Mirrorpix The Argentine competed in a vastly different era of the sport winning 24 races in 51 starts on the way to five world championships in the 1950s. Im a fan of Michael Schumacher but Fangio is a little better... the best the best the king said Vettel. The German also went on to give his verdict on Verstappen who may well enter the GOAT debate one day after romping to 2022 title  the second of his career  aged 25. I think hes had a hell of a season so hopefully he goes on and get 16 wins by the end of the year because anything else will be a disappointment Vettel added. It is great for Red Bull and I still know some people there so I am really happy for them. Obviously they have a lot of momentum from last year and the car this year is incredible. They won races even though they were heavier than anybody else and I think now theyve finally got the weight out. So the car is there but Max is doing an amazing job as well.

failed yet fruitful Alpine F1 seat pitch that began on Instagram, https://the-race.com/formula-1/the-failed-yet-fruitful-alpine-2023-pitch-that-began-on-instagram/, Jack Doohan has not managed to get an Alpine Formula 1 drive for 2023. And while Alpine has unsurprisingly gone for a more experienced option for its 2023 race seat in Pierre Gasly Doohans efforts have still been worthwhile. So I actually sent him a DM on Instagram  basically this huge big long paragraph saying why I think I could be a candidate going forward. He took his first feature race win at Spa  which was the sort of message ontrack that he was telegraphing to Alpine offtrack. At that point in time ninth in Formula 2 and not really in a position to go to Formula 1., Jack Doohan has not managed to get an Alpine Formula 1 drive for 2023. But its not for the lack of trying. F1s newest free practice debutant is now frontandcentre in Alpines junior programme following the messy Oscar Piastri saga. Doohan had more nerves chasing Alpine seat than FP1 debut Read more That might have seemed like a natural progression given he was the highestplaced Alpine protege in the junior ranks when it became clear Piastri would be leaving the team but whatever it owes to circumstance it owes an equal amount to Doohans impressive proactivity. From sending Alpine CEO Laurent Rossi direct messages on social media to emailing Alpines lead engineer on the first weekend after the summer break Doohan did all he could to shape his own destiny. And while Alpine has unsurprisingly gone for a more experienced option for its 2023 race seat in Pierre Gasly Doohans efforts have still been worthwhile. On the night that all that news broke I didnt have Laurents number or anything Doohan says. So I actually sent him a DM on Instagram  basically this huge big long paragraph saying why I think I could be a candidate going forward. And he replied at like 3am  I think he was in the US or somewhere  with his number at the bottom and that wed chat in the coming days. Then I think I spoke to Otmar Szafnauer the following night briefly. And every day I was kind of trying to speak to whoever I can in all parts of the Formula 1 team and all parts of the structure for the Academy. It was an opportunity and even if it was a farfetched one at least now with the seat closed off and Pierre taking it I know that Im not sitting here going I wish I pushed a little bit more I wish I tried. Alonsos 2022 misery has a silver lining  but not for him Read more For a solid six weeks I was doing absolutely everything I can to try and secure myself in the seat. Sure it didnt work out as hoped. But it had its upsides. Doohan was only ninth in Formula 2 heading into F1s summer break. He took his first feature race win at Spa  which was the sort of message ontrack that he was telegraphing to Alpine offtrack. If hed been off Alpines radar before August the team quickly discovered how serious Doohan was. It has been impressed by how he conducted himself and the way he behaved certainly didnt hurt his chances of replacing Piastri in the Friday practice sessions Alpine had lined up for its reserve driver. In Doohans words good things came out of it. After making his pitch to Alpines most senior figures he sought to embed himself in the team more which also aided his Formula 2 campaign. It had flickered into life just before the summer break but has enjoyed a sustained improvement since everything kicked off at Alpine at the start of August even if some circumstances have stopped Doohan from turning that into as many points as he should have. Whats going on with Piastris Alpine F1 exit Read more From the moment it all happened I was pushing on every aspect that I could to try and secure a position in Formula 1 Doohan says. And as we got to Spa I was speaking with the team as well. At that point in time ninth in Formula 2 and not really in a position to go to Formula 1. And the guys were saying its probably highly unlikely well focus on Formula 2. On Friday morning at Spa I emailed the chief engineer Ciaron Pilbeam and I said do you mind if I sit in on the preFP1 briefing And he said yeah for sure. I started from there kind of embedding myself more into the team and really trying to understand how the weekend falls into place and and basically trying to take in as much information as I can. Honestly I think when I was coming back to Formula 2 things were just so much more simple. The information coming from engineer to driver and everything that I was taking in was so much less. I think that was helping me as well. I saw that I had an opportunity to go to Formula 1. So I was going if I just enjoy this and it happens I do have a chance here. Whereas before I was obviously behind Oscar and it was maybe looking more like a twoyear project. Why Alpine thinks Gaslys a better fit than Alonso or Piastri Read more It still might be in the sense Doohan is heading for a second year in Formula 2. But if thats the case it will be with the knowledge he is at the front of the Alpine queue having made a real impression on the people in charge and has developed into a driver who will start 2023 as the title favourite. From how he conducted himself during the peak of the Piastri saga to his preparation for his FP1 debut in Mexico and his general offtrack attitude Doohans earned plenty of plaudits internally at Alpine. Team principal Otmar Szafnauer says Doohans preparation was exemplary going in wanting to know everything before Mexico and sporting director Alan Permane reckons Doohans character might prove to be an ace up the sleeve. What impresses me most about Jack honestly is out of the car says Permane. His preparation the work he does behind the scenes. Hed never driven here and there hadnt been a plan for him to drive here. And a few weeks ago he was in Brisbane doing some F2 sponsor commitments and we told him he was going to be driving in Mexico. He flew back to the UK did a day in the sim and then came onwards to Austin and here. So thats what impresses me most  his preparation. Theres no doubt about his speed. When he makes it to Formula 1 thatll be a nice differentiator for him.

Like millions of new F1 fans Sam and I started watching Netflixs Drive to Survive in early lockdowns., You will hear a Formula 1 car before you see it. You will feel it before you see it. Theres almost a sense of foreshadowing of air being sucked back down the track. The highpitched scream rises eats into your eardrums until suddenly in a visceral release it rockets past. Neeeuuummm Instantly its gone again like a fighter jet on rails. F1 cars are so fast so low to the ground the drivers head is at roughly hip height its breathtaking.

Practice is underway a helicopter flies overhead and the cars are milling around the Autodromo Nazionale Monza at up to 347kmh. Stepping through the gigantic steel bleachers we see the track on the other side of a fence  astonishingly what feels like a few metres away. A F1 car flies by with such volume and pace I wince and take a step back. Theres another. And another. Then an extra energy ripples through the crowd. A bright red car approaches. Its Charles Leclercs Ferrari and fans go ballistic. He thunders past the tifosi and they react like football supporters whose team has scored a matchwinning goal. And this is just a practice session.

Picture Beata ZawrzelNur Read More Its Monzas 100th anniversary Grand Prix and theres a festival atmosphere around the circuit. The autodromo threads through one of Europes largest parks lots of walking is involved and its surrounded not just by grandstands but a fanzone DJs and stalls selling food drink and walletbusting merch an official baseball cap costs 60 a hoodie 180. The main event is of course Sundays race but Grands Prix stretch over three or four days including free practice sessions a qualifying hour that decides the grid starting order and a host of other races vintage car parades and sideshows in between. Its a fun friendly vibe with far more kids families and women than youd find at say a Premier League match. And the waves of red around leave little doubt that most are shouting for Ferrari. Our trip began when we couldnt travel at all. Like millions of new F1 fans Sam and I started watching Netflixs Drive to Survive in early lockdowns. When the 2020 season kicked off under empty stands we bought a sports TV subscription to watch it. The strategy the speed the crashes the characters the rivalries  we were hooked and our interest has only grown over the two seasons since. Expand Close Sam among the home crowd  Facebook Twitter Email Whatsapp Sam among the home crowd Were not alone. Around us in Monza I hear a surprising amount of Irish accents and see a couple of GAA jerseys. The epic 2021 rivalry between Red Bulls Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes which controversially came down to the last lap amped up the drama. Young fans have found young drivers like Leclerc Lando Norris and Mick Schumacher relatable. Theyre on TikTok and Insta. F1s popularity is catching fire in the lucrative US market with tickets for a new Las Vegas Grand Prix including The Strip next year starting from 500. Suddenly it seems everyone wants a piece of this sport. Of course F1 can be boring too. Theyre just going around in circles Sams sister sometimes chides. Shes right... technically. Its also true that sustainability sportswashing there are races in Saudi Arabia and Qatar for example and rule confusion threaten its credibility. But we also see scintillating speed strategy and skill within those circles. Variables like weather pit stops tyres and track differences throw up unknowns. There are only 20 drivers and they speak their minds in interviews or fits of passion or pique on team radios. Its all served up with the awesome immersiveness of modern TV. And now were in the middle of it in Monzas Temple of Speed. Its so loud Sam grins despite wearing ear plugs and overear headphones. Through it all fans mingle with hardly any agro and punters range from hardcore fans on the embankments or even climbing trees to VIP guests paying thousands for pitlane access and paddock tours.

Saturdays qualifying run is a highlight. Our seats are on the Laterale Parabolica a famous corner amidst waves of Ferrari red interspersed with the Orange Army of Dutch Verstappen fans. In the dying moments of the session Leclerc posts a scorching lap time that puts him on provisional pole. The crowd erupts. When Verstappen fails to nail a faster lap the cheers are even louder. The track is 5.79km long so we only get to see a sliver of the realtime action but big screens relay whats happening elsewhere. Its a super sporting spectacle. Im not surprised to learn sports travel packages are on the rise. Cassidy Travel with whom we travelled has already released its F1 packages for 2023 spokesperson John Spollen says they are popular as Christmas gifts and not just for petrol heads anymore. But anyone considering a Grand Prix trip needs to think about travel times the costs of food drink and transport in different destinations and factors like how familyfriendly different track layouts are what kind of walking and transfers are involved and the views your money buys in grandstands or general admission. Street circuits offer different experiences to parkland tracks for example. Venues range from Singapore to Silverstone Melbourne to Monaco. Unfortunately the experience outside of Monzas track and stands is disappointing. There are long frustrating queues for portaloos water stations and food and drink stalls. A terribly executed token system leaves us queuing for 75 minutes to buy tokens and then starting again in another line to spend them on overpriced food and water. Theres no cash cards or contactless payments no queue management and uncomfortable scrums of people at entrances exits and walkways at peak times. All of this takes place under a hot sun with the added stress of a chaotic Milan train station and odd autodromo rules  such as only being allowed to bring 500ml water bottles without caps into the festival site or having to scan tickets to exit as well as enter stands. Staff are patient but Im amazed more fans dont freak out. It definitely mars the Monza magic for us and makes the overall experience a bit... well chequered. You are not the first person to report these inconveniences to us and we regret it Federico Martegani of Monzas communications office tells me when I email afterwards. The token system was designed to reduce queues he says but we did not calculate the huge number of people on the weekend 330000 people between Friday and Sunday... an absolute record for us. We apologise for the inconvenience and this problem will certainly serve as a lesson for us to change our approach for next year. I hope so. At any rate none of this reflects on our travel agent or the ontrack action  its on the event organisers. Sam and I end the days dusty sweaty and exhausted with more than 18000 steps on my phones counter. Expand Close Entering the festival atmosphere...

And when Sundays Grand Prix starts the frustration quickly fades away. We bring ice cream and sweets. There are DJs and jet flybys leaving smoke trails in green red and white. Shortly before the race drivers are paraded around in vintage openbacked cars  so close we can see their faces. The Rolex clock ticks down and the crowds cheer everything  even the guy sweeping the track who starts to move his brush in time with their roars. The anticipation is electric. When the red lights go out the grid roars into action. The first time the field passes us bunched up and competing for track position at insane speeds it comes with an exhilarating storm of noise stink of rubber and slipstream of wind think of that feeling when a train passes at full pelt on a platform. Beforehand I wondered if the reallife race could match the TV coverage. But we can see screens showing pit stops overtakes and replays hear commentary bouncing between Italian and English and relate the cars flying by to the bigger picture giving us what amounts to the best of both worlds. In that moment being trackside is thrilling. It feels like Sam and I have traced a full circle from our days watching crowdless Covidera sport in isolation to being part of the great Grand Prix circus. We are inside a sport that gave us a new bond when the world shut its engines off. In the end Ferraris drivers are beaten with Verstappen taking the chequered flag on his way to a second World Championship. The tifosi are not impressed. But soon champagne will spray and fans of all hues will spill onto this historic track. After that the travelling bank will pack up and move to the next race in Singapore. I bet they can already feel the F1 cars coming.

For more information on its F1 travel packages for 2023 see below or visit cassidytravel.iesportsbreaks. Spa Belgium Fournight packages with Grandstand Speed Corner tickets and a threestar hotel stay from 499pp flights extra. The Belgian Grand Prix runs from July 2730.

Fournight packages including flights a fourstar hotel stay and seated tickets from 675pp. Barcelona Spain A fivenight package with general admission tickets hotel accommodation and return flights starts from 999pp. The Spanish Grand Prix runs from June 14. Should I get general admission or grandstand tickets General admission is usually the cheapest ticket but its all relative  F1 is a pricey sport and tickets are typically for three days. These will allow access to general areas often at track height or raised ground around it with no fixed seats. You will need to arrive early for the best spots especially for qualifying and the Grand Prix itself and remember that the spots are not guaranteed  if you need to go to the loo for example. Grandstands are priced according to the views they offer and the chance of seeing some action  overtakes braking zones chicanes and so on. The priciest are usually opposite the pit lanes and starting grid where you will see the start of the race and the chequered flag. Hospitality tickets offering VIP access can cost many multiples of the price  running to thousands of euro. Seated tickets mean you can come and go from your spot. Its a good idea to try for an elevated view too  this can allow you to see the cars coming earlier and track them for longer. But it will depend on particular circuits the surrounding trees or buildings and so on. What to Pack for a Grand Prix Tracks differ widely in terms of layout locations facilities and weather. Research yours and its prohibited items carefully before compiling your packing list. Inevitably a lot of walking will be involved tracks can be several kilometres long. Wear comfy shoes and loose clothes. You may also need a hat shades sunscreen and a small umbrella for the sunrain as well as a few energy bars and water. A poncho or light rainjacket is handy too. Remember you will have to carry what you bring for the day so check the track rules as to what size bags are allowed and for any specific restrictions  such as the size of water bottles or sunscreen containers and whether phone battery packs or items like tripods are allowed. Ear defenders and ear plugs are a good idea especially for young fans. These can be bought around the track but will cost considerably less outside of it. Its better to have them and find you dont always need them than to regret not having them. A small pair of binoculars can be handy but the cars move so fast it can be hard to track them. A lanyard and pouch is useful to keep tickets and QR codes visible as they need to be scanned regularly to access stands  also to keep them safe. At the track Get a programme and figure out what action you want to see  the Formula 1 highlights of course but it will also include F2 races vintage parades and a surprising number of undercard races. Generally speaking concession stalls for food drink and merch are less busy during the popular track action or outside of peak times like lunch. You may also find cheaper food drink and souvenirs though not official merch outside of the festival boundaries. Be mindful of things like your phone battery and have a safety plan for kids in case you get separated. After the chequered flag some circuits allow fans onto the track for the champagne celebrations  research where this access will be and have a think about your exit and whether the crowds will be safe for families before committing.

Its hard to make a statement in Vegas because everything is so big said Greg Maffei CEO of Liberty Media the ownership group of Formula One. This paddock building will be a sign of our longterm commitment to the Vegas community. It will serve as a yearround attraction to our fans and will be one of our most spectacular facilities. Between the land purchase and building construction F1 will have invested 500 million in Las Vegas before a race even occurs according to Gov. Steve Sisolak.

They told me between the land and what theyre building that theyre putting here thats a half a billion dollars right here. On top of everything else theyre building. All the stands on the Strip all the other things that theyre putting together. The economic impact this is going to make in the economy in Las Vegas is going to be astronomical. The Las Vegas Grand Prix isnt just a onetime thing the race is signed to occur at least three times starting next year. But hope is to make the race the marquee one on F1s schedule for the foreseeable future. The intention is for this to be a permanent event said Steve Hill president and CEO of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. Its going to be spectacular. We want it every year and they want to be here. F1 officials plan to use the paddock site for other events outside of nonrace weekends getting their monies worth from the eyepopping facility. This is a true investment in Clark County in the community said Clark County Commissioner Michael Naft. This will be a permanent facility. Yes it will be used for the worlds greatest events for Formula One events. But it will also be here yearround employing people putting people to work. And also boosting our economy and giving us one more thing to be proud of. Formula One CEO Stefano Domenicali said the paddock building cements Formula Ones commitment to the city. We want to stay for a long time Domenicali said. Its with great excitement that were there to celebrate this moment that is just the beginning.  This will be the F1 statement in Las Vegas.

Room rates began around 700 per night but were well over 1000 per night for locations along the race route. While the costs are high the race will draw droves of people from all over the world who will gladly pay the heightened fees Sisolak said. People are willing to pay from all over the world to come see it he said. People are going to be staying all over town here. Every hotel has got increased room prices by 300400 percent. Its not that theyre gouging people theyve got an investment in this as well. The skyhigh hotel prices speak to the international draw a segment that is still slowly returning to Las Vegas postpandemic Naft said. People from all over the world have been watching for those rates become available and bookings open up Naft said. It also speaks to the incredible impact this is going to have on our economy. Those room rates also translate to hotel tax revenue sales tax revenue and those are the dollars that literally help boost the economy for people like me and family who live here. The people who will be in the stands around the Strip and surrounding area next year arent the only ones who will be excited. The drivers they will be watching are itching to race along one of the most famous stretches of roads in the world. I think its going to be wild to be honest said F1 star driver George Russell. Super excited to come here and race in Vegas. I think weve seen the momentum that Formula One has in America and bringing the race to Vegas is just topping that off at another level.

Formula 1’s Toto Wolff accused of running his team remotely leans into software even more, https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/04/formula-1s-toto-wolff-looks-for-fresh-edge-in-2023-through-remote-software/, We really try to go through a system like we have at Formula 1 like a team. In fact Wolff said the team has cut its emissions by nearly 90 in recent years. Surely for a company promising great efficiency to its customers theres nothing like having a revered Formula 1 team boss sing your praises. Earlier this year reports Knight Horner referred to Wolff who lives in Monaco as a tax exile who  he added disparagingly  runs his team remotely. Wolff in conversation with Knight said of Horner in turn Hes just so simple., Toto Wolff the 50yearold Austrian chief executive team principal and partowner of the Mercedes Formula 1 team who was recently described by The New Yorker as someone who might breeze past you in the airport smelling good wearing loafers and no socks talked openly yesterday about his teams terrible nogood year. Sitting with Oliver Steil the CEO of the German company TeamViewer a popular maker of remote support software Wolff also described how the troubled racing team is counting in part on TeamViewers tech to give it an edge in its bid to recapture its former glory. The two were speaking at the Web Summit conference in Lisbon and Wolff was cheered when he appeared before the crowd owing in no small part to Drive to Survive the Netflix series that has made him famous. He finds this amusing recounting to New Yorker writer Sam Knight how a young woman threw herself through the open window of his car to get her picture taken. Wolff immediately acknowledged the obvious as he settled in. We won the championship eight times in a row he said but that is the past. Mercedes he continued just got the physics wrong . . . and got the concept of the car not in the right place he said referring to the design of its floor which he has previously pointed to as the root of the teams lackluster year. Every few years the F1 teams  there are currently 10 altogether  are forced by the body overseeing Grand Prix racing to redesign their cars. Indeed its largely because it takes a long time to unwind things that are built into the car said Wolff that his team last year turned to TeamViewer a 17yearold publicly traded company whose software can remotely access and connect any computer tablet laptop mobile device or IoT endpoint like an industrial machine  or race car  to allow the remote control management and monitoring of these devices. Its a match made in heaven suggested Steil who said that TeamViewer is working closely with the MercedesAMG Petronas team to make it more efficient including running lab tests out of hours and supporting the trackside crew via remote engineers. We really try to go through a system like we have at Formula 1 like a team. We see the different parts and we see what can we do differently if we connect in real time in addition to what we do maybe on trackside and in the back office. Were really working through the different parts of the organization on testing obviously production maintenance wind tunnel all these kinds of applications where we try to see where can be better . . . Wolff chimed in separately to paint the bigger picture. We are racing 23 times around the world around the globe during the racing season and our core team is just 90 engineers with 2000 back at the factory including 1000 people focused on the chassis side and another 1000 focused on the engine. Operating in the field or we call it surgery in the field Wolff said is not always trivial because if you open up an engine or a complicated cooling system you want to have the resource from back at home and TeamViewer is the only technology that allows us today in having the guy back at home look through the same borescope into the cylinder head then help the mechanic on the field. As an added and not inconsequential benefit said both men the partnership cuts down on emissions because it means moving fewer people around at a time when Mercedes is focusing increasingly on sustainability. In fact Wolff said the team has cut its emissions by nearly 90 in recent years. It is our responsibility to show our global audience of billions of spectators that if we can do it everyone can do it he said. Certainly the appearance was a great moment for TeamViewer whose other clients range from telecommunications companies to the fastfood franchise Wendys. Surely for a company promising great efficiency to its customers theres nothing like having a revered Formula 1 team boss sing your praises. Of course what racing fans want to know is whether the tech will give Mercedes  which has yet to win a race in 2022  enough of an edge to overcome the teams archrivals Red Bull and Ferrari. While Wolff is looking to tomorrow as he said yesterday it could take a while even with the faster feedback loops that TeamViewers technology provides the team. As he recently told the outlet RacingNews365 Mercedes is still eight to 10 months behind Red Bull in terms of Formula 1 development after its frustrating 2022 season. There is definitely a challenge he added but we are playing the long game all of us. The intense rivalry between the two teams though perfect for television remains very real in the meantime. As The New Yorker piece observes of the 10 team principals in the sport only Wolff and Christian Horner who runs the Red Bull team have ever won a world championship and they appear to truly loathe one another. Earlier this year reports Knight Horner referred to Wolff who lives in Monaco as a tax exile who  he added disparagingly  runs his team remotely. Wolff in conversation with Knight said of Horner in turn Hes just so simple.

Formula 1 teams are looking at introducing new winter shutdown for staff wellbeing, https://www.planetf1.com/news/formula-1-winter-shutdown-proposal/, A winter break comprising a total shutdown of factory operations could be introduced into Formula 1. The sport already has a summer shutdown during the August holiday when development work must stop and similar could follow around the Christmas and New Year period. Although team staff inevitably will have some time off over the festive period there is nothing as yet mandated in the F1 regulations. But for the race team thats clocking many airline miles thats a positive.Winter shutdown can only be a good moveIf it works in the summer there is no reason why it shouldnt do so in the winter also. Taking away that dilemma appears to be something of a nobrainer as the Formula 1 schedule  and the increasing demands that go with it  takes on recordbreaking proportions., A winter break comprising a total shutdown of factory operations could be introduced into Formula 1. The sport already has a summer shutdown during the August holiday when development work must stop and similar could follow around the Christmas and New Year period. It would be a measure to try and offset the effects of the expanding race calendar which is up to a record 24 grands prix in 2023. Although team staff inevitably will have some time off over the festive period there is nothing as yet mandated in the F1 regulations. Motorsport.com are reporting such a proposal intended to start from December 2023 has been made at a meeting of the Sporting Advisory Committee but is still some way from being finalised. Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff is in favour having been quoted as saying Many of us team principals would like to replicate what we have in the summer at least starting at Christmas and going into the new year for two weeks. Obviously thats still up for discussion. But there was a positive indication for the wellbeing of the people. At least in 202223 there will be a longer break between seasons as the final race of this year the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix takes place on November 20 to avoid more than one days overlap with the football World Cup which begins that day. And whereas in 202122 there was less than 11 weeks between the end of one campaign and the start of unofficial testing for the next that will increase to just under 14 as preseason running in Bahrain begins on February 23. Its great that the season finishes this couple of weeks earlier than in the past because everyone is really at the limit added Wolff. Having this two weeks more is definitely a nice welcome but on the other side there are many people in the factory who will work flat out between Christmas and New Year. But for the race team thats clocking many airline miles thats a positive. Winter shutdown can only be a good move If it works in the summer there is no reason why it shouldnt do so in the winter also. For any team that doubted whether they could afford to ease down over the festive period and allow staff to spend time with their families it would remove the need for any difficult decisions. The fear would obviously have been conceding a competitive advantage. A bit like when decathlete Daley Thompson and darts legend Phil Taylor used to train and practice respectively on Christmas Day because they expected their rivals would not be. Taking away that dilemma appears to be something of a nobrainer as the Formula 1 schedule  and the increasing demands that go with it  takes on recordbreaking proportions.

Weve got quite a few interested collectors he said. In 2017 we sold a car from the 2001 season also driven by Schumacher. At the time we estimated the car at 3.5 million and in the end it sold for 7.5 million so it proves that theres still a special interest in these cars especially those with such a history he said. The car was sold in New York to a US buyer. Schumacher has not been seen in public since suffering serious injuries in skiing accident in 2013.

Formula 1 Breakout Zhou Guanyu Loves Wearing Rick Owens—and Left Austin With a Pair of Cowboy Boots, https://www.gq.com/story/zhou-guanyu-f1-interview, The irony of getting stuck in traffic isnt lost on Formula 1 driver Zhou Guanyu. This morning however hes clad in his Alfa Romeo uniformsans the luchador mask that hed later don for a Twitter photo. So I like the stuff you can wear all the time not just for the catwalk or fashion show. Do you have a favorite Rick Owens piece I look piece by piece because I dont like to buy a whole thing I like to buy a single piece thats good for me and then put it all together myself., The irony of getting stuck in traffic isnt lost on Formula 1 driver Zhou Guanyu. Early on Friday morning ahead of the Mexico Grand Prix the extremely apologetic Alfa Romeo racer got stuck in Mexico City traffic and was therefore running behind on his way to do press ahead of practice sessions. Guanyu is turning heads in his inaugural F1 season for quite a few different reasonshes the firstever Chinese F1 driver and his personal style is giving Lewis Hamilton a run for his money as its not uncommon to see the driver show up to the paddock in striking Prada numbers. This morning however hes clad in his Alfa Romeo uniformsans the luchador mask that hed later don for a Twitter photo. For a driver who typically plans his outfits in advance maybe its laundry day. Or perhaps hes got something cooked up for later in the weekend. While the fight for first is overRed Bull driver Max Verstappen solidified a top finish for both the individual drivers competition and the overall team battle over the last two Grand PrixGuanyu and Alfa Romeo are in a heated competition to finish out the year on a high note. With a few more races left on the schedule Guanyu spoke with GQ about how he gets dressed his love for Rick Owens and Kobe Bryant his inaugural visit to Texas and more. Who are some of the other most stylish guys on the grid I think everybody knows Lewis as the first and is the guy who brings fashion to the paddock. But theres more drivers getting into it now for sure. I feel like I was kind of the second guy that was able to bring a fashion sense here. It feels nice in a way when you look back at the beginning of the season when I was doing my own stuff that theres people definitely doing it more often like the Alpha Tauri boys Pierre Gasly and Yuki Tsunoda and some other teams. But its good to keep it real keep with what you like as your site says so thats what Im trying to do. Is there one particular fashion icon you admired going up Rick Owens. For me hes one of the most inspirational of all time. I really like to dress in black or black and white. I dont really fancy too much colorful stuff. I like his stuff because he can go absolutely crazy go nuts with the designing. Then when you pull it all together you can still wear them quite casually. It doesnt look crazy. So I like the stuff you can wear all the time not just for the catwalk or fashion show. Do you have a favorite Rick Owens piece Its hard to say but in general I actually like all their fits. Especially this winter period. They had these puff jackets without the sleeves. Very long and baggy. But in general I dont know. I look piece by piece because I dont like to buy a whole thing I like to buy a single piece thats good for me and then put it all together myself.

Wolff: Reputation damage from breaking F1 cost cap enough of a deterrent, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/wolff-reputation-damage-from-breaking-f1-cost-cap-enough-of-a-deterrent/10394942/, Listen to this articleRed Bulls breach of the cost cap limit in 2021 triggered a major controversy within F1 recently with opinions divided in the paddock about how extreme the sanctions taken again it should be. And reflecting on his stance Wolff said that the main thing that would turn teams off from risking even minor breaches was the bad publicity such a move brings. Beyond the sporting penalty and the financial penalty which obviously resonates in the real world out there there is a big reputational consequence said Wolff. Were getting kids that are being bullied in playgrounds that are employees children that is not right through fictitious allegations from other teams. It was a first strong governance strong policing independent assessment., Listen to this article Red Bulls breach of the cost cap limit in 2021 triggered a major controversy within F1 recently with opinions divided in the paddock about how extreme the sanctions taken again it should be. In the end the Milton Keynesbased outfit was handed a 7 million fine and had its aero development allowance cut back by 10 because it overspent by around 1.8 million last year. Wolff was quite calm about the penalty the FIA settled on admitting in Mexico that while Mercedes felt it was too little equally he accepted Red Bull probably felt it was too harsh. And reflecting on his stance Wolff said that the main thing that would turn teams off from risking even minor breaches was the bad publicity such a move brings. Beyond the sporting penalty and the financial penalty which obviously resonates in the real world out there there is a big reputational consequence said Wolff. And that is why I believe no team is going to put a foot wrong over the line because you dont want to have your partners and your team dragged into this space. Were living in a transparent compliant world. Everything needs governance and the sport needs it. As a sport overall this is the real achievement of the whole process. Toto Wolff Team Principal and CEO Mercedes AMG Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images Red Bull has found itself on the receiving end of some extreme media criticisms in recent weeks and its team principal Christian Horner has not been happy about the strains the cost cap case has put on staff  especially when words like cheating have been bandied about. Weve been on trial because of public accusations since Singapore said Horner recently. The numbers have been put out in the media that are miles out of reality. And the damage that does to the brand to our partners to our drivers to our workforce in an age where mental health is prevalent were seeing significant issues within our workforce. Were getting kids that are being bullied in playgrounds that are employees children that is not right through fictitious allegations from other teams. You cannot go around just making that kind of allegation without any fact or substance. We absolutely are appalled at the behaviour of some of our competitors. Asked why Mercedes had been so calm about Red Bulls final penalty despite initial anger when it emerged the rule breach had taken place Wolff said Im beyond the point now that I want to comment on what is being said there. So for me the most important outcome of this whole process is there is a penalty whether its too small right or too big  difficult to judge. It was a first strong governance strong policing independent assessment. And then a fine. That wouldnt have been the case in the past I guess.
McLaren star's new attitude towards his F1 dream, https://the-race.com/formula-1/mclaren-stars-new-attitude-towards-his-f1-dream/, In little more than a year Pato OWard went from Red Bull F1 junior programme reject  in ridiculous fashion  to IndyCar star and future F1 tester with McLaren. The fact hes being trusted with 10 million Ayrton Senna McLaren F1 cars reflects the regard he is held in at McLaren but his approach to driving that car perhaps reflects a new or modified attitude OWard has towards his chances of making it to F1. Asked by The Race about how hes balancing his IndyCar career with keeping his foot in the door with F1 OWard says Step by step I guess Yeah step by step. But its also very important to enjoy where youre at enjoy the moment enjoy the present and maximise it., In little more than a year Pato OWard went from Red Bull F1 junior programme reject  in ridiculous fashion  to IndyCar star and future F1 tester with McLaren. The fact hes being trusted with 10 million Ayrton Senna McLaren F1 cars reflects the regard he is held in at McLaren but his approach to driving that car perhaps reflects a new or modified attitude OWard has towards his chances of making it to F1. Why driving Sennas M c Laren left OWard feeling mad Read more When he won the Texas IndyCar race in 2021 as part of a bet with Zak Brown he would get to test McLaren machinery in Abu Dhabi at the end of the year. It completed a whirlwind turnaround in fortune for the driver who was promised so much in the past but dare he dream this time it would be a reality Complications around the end of last year and the beginning of this one surrounding OWards future contract put a damper on a test where he probably wasnt physically prepared enough for F1  see comments about his neck being destroyed  and hed probably admit now he allowed himself to get caught up in the narrative that an F1 future was possible before it was realistic. Asked by The Race about how hes balancing his IndyCar career with keeping his foot in the door with F1 OWard says Step by step I guess Yeah step by step. And its important not to get too ahead of yourself. And its hard not to  very hard not to. But its also very important to enjoy where youre at enjoy the moment enjoy the present and maximise it. And I feel like with doing so doors will open and things will align. If I keep doing my job properly and keep performing. OWards contract dispute with McLaren turned messy and clouded the first part of the year until things began to turn around in April and at the Long Beach race in IndyCar OWard used a hotel room discussion with his cousin to establish a new attitude which can be over simplified for explanation purposes as you can only focus on what you can control everything else is out of your hands and will fall into place. Targeting a proper offseason and spending time with his family is a top priority for OWard as he felt like the business of last years post IndyCar season activities left him jaded by the time the season came around in February alongside his contract dispute that dragged on. It just sucked  M c Laren contract sagas effect on OWard Read more With a new contract in May he found a new level and only reliability issues halted a title campaign that featured him qualifying in IndyCars Fast Six on every single road course this year. Sorting his contract focusing on things he could control and ensuring time for himself away from the track all helped construct this new mentality or at least approach. Now OWard faces the complication of 2021 IndyCar champion Alex Palou coming into the fold and testing at McLaren as the pair shared F1 tests in Barcelona and Austria last month with Palou taking the first FP1 opportunity and running less than three tenths off Lando Norris on comparable tyres at COTA. Palou wasnt allowed to shine in FP1  but he still impressed Read more But OWards revised attitude  plus what appears to be the inherent belief he can take on and beat Palou on a level playing field  means F1 opportunities are a bonus as opposed to a key part of his immediate goals. After Im done with the FP1 Ill be able to relate a little bit more what it feels like but Im just so grateful for the opportunity adds OWard. And I want to be a sponge just absorb everything that Im learning and continue to learn. And just keep improving  help the team and just never forget to enjoy it because thats the most important thing. Enjoying it is a phrase that can certainly be used to describe OWards opinion of driving the Senna McLaren MP45B at Laguna Seca last month. Even if that came with pressure  Brown made sure OWard knew the cars 10 million value just as he was getting in the car to take it for a spin  the enjoyment and carefree attitude OWard approached the historic test in is the perfect metaphor for the new mental space hes approaching his contemporary F1 opportunities with.
F1 finally ready to consider credible 11th-team entry, https://www.gpfans.com/en/f1-news/95331/f1-11-team-stefano-domenicali/, Sam HallFriday 4 November 2022 1514  Updated 1518F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali has claimed the sport is finally ready to entertain credible proposals to increase the grid to 11 teams. The value of the 10 teams currently in F1 has risen steeply since Liberty Media acquired the championship ahead of the 2017 season. Despite appearing to warm to the idea of an 11th team Domenicali warned again that it cannot come at a price to existing teams. This is what is written in the Concorde Agreement but mainly the point is that does a new entry bring a better position for the F1 world championship This is really in terms of value from a financial point of view and in terms of value from a sporting point of view., Sam Hall Friday 4 November 2022 1514  Updated 1518 F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali has claimed the sport is finally ready to entertain credible proposals to increase the grid to 11 teams. The value of the 10 teams currently in F1 has risen steeply since Liberty Media acquired the championship ahead of the 2017 season. This value was protected in the latest Concorde Agreement by the addition of a 200million antidilution fee that would be split between the existing teams upon the arrival of a new entry. Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff has been vocal in his opposition to any new team unless it can benefit the entire paddock and although echoing these comments Domenicali has hinted at a change in the position now from F1. It is not a problem having one more team to have better racing therefore we will see and we will monitor the situation said Domenicali in an investors call following the release of Liberty Medias thirdquarter financial results. READ MORE...F1 enjoys another revenue bump as recovery continues If there would be a real credible new entry that wants to discuss with us we are ready to discuss but we are not in a rushed position today for that. Franchise dilution cannot be allowed Michael Andretti has been battling to position his successful outfit in the sport and recently told GPFans that F1 would be our life. Despite appearing to warm to the idea of an 11th team Domenicali warned again that it cannot come at a price to existing teams. With regard to the value or the process of the possibility of bringing a new F1 team into the championship of course there is the primary step that both us and the FIA have to be in agreement on that he added. And I think the first thing that we need to consider is will this eventual possibility bring extra value to the championship If so of course we are going to discuss it internally and we will see if there is any kind of real potential for a new entry that can give value to the championship. On top of this there is a value that has to be recognised to the teams that are already in the championship because of course they cannot allow any dilution of their partnership with the F1 championship. This is what is written in the Concorde Agreement but mainly the point is that does a new entry bring a better position for the F1 world championship This is really in terms of value from a financial point of view and in terms of value from a sporting point of view.
F1 reports increase in quarterly revenue as COVID recovery complete, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/f1-reports-increase-in-revenue-in-latest-quarter/10394978/, Overall F1 revenue rose from 668m in 2021 to 715m in 2022 for JulySeptember although operating income was only up from 80m to 82m thanks to increased costs. Because of that change race promotion income was actually slightly down but that was offset by increases in broadcast and sponsorship revenue. Primary F1 revenue increased in the third quarter with growth across media rights and sponsorship partially offset by a decline in race promotion revenue. Media rights increased due to growth in F1 TV subscription revenue and increased fees under new and renewed contractual agreements and sponsorship revenue increased due to the recognition of revenue from new sponsors. In addition other cost of F1 revenue grew due to higher commissions and partner servicing costs associated with the Primary F1 revenue streams and higher Formula 2 and Formula 3 related costs., Listen to this article However the change was not as dramatic as in previous quarters because income in the latter part of 2021 was not impacted as dramatically by the pandemic as last year race attendances began to return to normal levels and the lucrative Paddock Club got back up to speed. Overall F1 revenue rose from 668m in 2021 to 715m in 2022 for JulySeptember although operating income was only up from 80m to 82m thanks to increased costs. The 10 F1 teams shared payments of 370m up from 338m in 2021. The JulySeptember periods of 2021 and 2022 provide for a fairly accurate comparison as both featured seven races. Six events were the same across both seasons while the major difference was that the first year featured the more lucrative Russian GP whereas France fell into the same period in 2022. Because of that change race promotion income was actually slightly down but that was offset by increases in broadcast and sponsorship revenue. Explaining the figures F1 noted F1s results in 2022 are not being impacted by capacity limitations and throughout the first nine months of the 2022 season F1 has seen strong growth in attendance in the grandstands and the Paddock Club. Primary F1 revenue increased in the third quarter with growth across media rights and sponsorship partially offset by a decline in race promotion revenue. Race promotion revenue decreased due to lower fees generated from the different mix of events held with one additional race held outside of Europe in the prior year period. Media rights increased due to growth in F1 TV subscription revenue and increased fees under new and renewed contractual agreements and sponsorship revenue increased due to the recognition of revenue from new sponsors. Other F1 revenue increased in the third quarter primarily due to higher hospitality revenue generated from the Paddock Club which operated at one additional race in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the prior year period and has seen record attendance yeartodate. Explaining the overall rise in costs relative to 2021 F1 said These costs increased in the third quarter driven by the costs of higher hospitality attendance in the Paddock Club and one additional Paddock Club event operated compared to the prior year period. In addition other cost of F1 revenue grew due to higher commissions and partner servicing costs associated with the Primary F1 revenue streams and higher Formula 2 and Formula 3 related costs. Selling general and administrative expense increased in the third quarter due to higher personnel and IT costs and increased legal and other advisory fees.

Its been a nightmare of a season to be honest because of all these things all the DNFS being slow when the car was quick and now Im quick and we are not as quick as we used to be. This season has gone wrong but the positive side is that Im keeping my spirits up even on a horrible season or impossible to be more difficult season. But Max has had an amazing season he deserves it., The Spaniard struggled to come to terms with the Ferrari F175 in the first part of the year and had to adjust his driving style to suit it. However while his personal form has improved relative to teammate Charles Leclerc the car has latterly not been as consistently competitive as it was earlier in the year with Red Bulls Max Verstappen clinching the record for the most wins in a season with his 14th victory of 2022 in Mexico last weekend. Sainz who scored his maiden F1 win at Silverstone cites his pole at the US GP and a strong race in Mexico as signs that he has made progress despite languishing sixth in the championship behind both Mercedes drivers with two races remaining. I just know how to drive he said in Mexico of his better form. I mean its instinctive. Im not thinking about driving anymore. And you can see the lap times are coming a lot easier. And Im back to a level that I should have been at the beginning of the year. Now that Im at that level our car is maybe not as good. Its been a nightmare of a season to be honest because of all these things all the DNFS being slow when the car was quick and now Im quick and we are not as quick as we used to be. So its everything that has gone wrong. This season has gone wrong but the positive side is that Im keeping my spirits up even on a horrible season or impossible to be more difficult season. And Im still there with my engineers fighting still finding lap time in this car. I think it could have been very easy to give up on it and let the year go away but the pole in Austin and again being quick out here today I think its a good sign for us. Sainz led Leclerc home in Mexico as the pair finished a subdued fifth and sixth Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images Sainz is confident that the team can make progress next season as it seeks to close the gap to Red Bull. PLUS The 10 steps Ferrari needs to take for the Prancing Horse to be stable New year new car new regs even with the floor Sainz said on Ferraris prospects for 2023. We have another chance and I fully trust that the team will produce another great car like the car that we had this year and that we will learn from the mistakes done this year. I will learn from the mistakes I did this year and we will be more in the fight and ready to fight. Looking forward also for Mercedes. It looks like theyre going to join us at the front. Sainz also paid tribute to rival Verstappen after his recordbreaking tally stating You never expect that especially when you have a good car at the beginning. I wish that I would have felt a bit more comfortable at the beginning of the season to make things also a bit more complicated for Max and together with Charles put a up bit more of a fight. But Max has had an amazing season he deserves it. I think they are dominant now I think now the Red Bull is starting to be a dominant car but at the beginning of the season for sure not and there is where he did a tremendous job. My target is next year to start at the level that I am now which is a pretty decent level and make things more complicated to Max.
Ricciardo insists new Hamilton contract wouldn’t affect his F1 future as he aims to ‘come back with a vengeance’ in 2024, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.ricciardo-insists-new-hamilton-contract-wouldnt-affect-his-f1-future-as-he.njoqmlge4S9irGhkIVrvS.html, Daniel Ricciardo has brushed off suggestions that a fresh deal for Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes could make returning to the F1 grid in 2024 more difficult as he prepares to embark on a year out of the sport. Hes one of the greatest ever to do it and I think competing with him going wheel to wheel with him is fun its awesome. Its normally at the pointy end so I certainly wish to do that more in the future said Ricciardo.

I think my future will be I dont think its relative to what others do., Daniel Ricciardo has brushed off suggestions that a fresh deal for Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes could make returning to the F1 grid in 2024 more difficult as he prepares to embark on a year out of the sport. Ricciardo will be replaced by fellow Australian Oscar Piastri at McLaren next season and with Haas holding the one remaining vacancy on the 2023 grid the 33yearold recently admitted that its almost certain he wont be competing. READ MORE I wish it was like this more often  Ricciardo delighted with P7 finish as he explains Tsunoda crash One role Ricciardo remains open to is that of a reserve driver before working his way back into a race seat for the 2024 campaign with his name recently being linked to Mercedes  who need to replace AlphaTauribound Nyck de Vries. However a promotion from reserve duties to a race seat at the Silver Arrows appears unlikely at least in the near future with George Russell tied down on a longterm deal and team mate Hamilton confirming over the Mexico City Grand Prix weekend that he intends to sign a new contract. Ricciardo is set for a season out of the sport after a challenging twoyear spell at McLaren As the wait goes on to discover where Ricciardo will end up he made clear that his future ambitions are not pinned on the decisions of other drivers while expressing hope that Hamilton will continue for many years to come. The truth is I want him to stay in the sport. Hes one of the greatest ever to do it and I think competing with him going wheel to wheel with him is fun its awesome. Its normally at the pointy end so I certainly wish to do that more in the future said Ricciardo. READ MORE How cunning strategy allowed us to see Ricciardo back at his best in Mexico Thats where it currently lies. I think my future will be I dont think its relative to what others do. I think its how do I say it like opportunities will arise when they do but Im not banking on anyone doing something so I can find my way. Asked by Sky Sports F1 about the prospect of Ricciardo joining Mercedes in a reserve role Russell said Yeah I think thatd be interesting. I think wed like to see that. But its up to Daniel to see what he wants to do with his future. Ricciardo enjoyed plenty of ontrack battles with Hamilton during his time at Red Bull
Alpine: F1 2022 engine performance gain worth reliability risks, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/alpine-f1-2022-engine-performance-gain-worth-reliability-risks/10394839/, In Mexico Fernando Alonso lost seventh place in the closing laps after suffering a cylinder issue that obliged him to stop. Szafnauer insists that problems have largely resulted from a general push for performance with the power unit and that they can be resolved over the winter. So we made a conscious decision to push the performance envelope and fix reliability issues as we got to them because the FIA allows that. But if you have to err on that side you push the performance boundary because you cant add performance now until 2026 you can fix reliability issues. But the short term is reliability in the next few races finish strong and I think our performance will be there., Listen to this article The team has suffered more reliability problems than most rivals costing valuable ground in the battle with McLaren for fourth in the world championship. Alpine is currently in front by just seven points. In Mexico Fernando Alonso lost seventh place in the closing laps after suffering a cylinder issue that obliged him to stop. Szafnauer insists that problems have largely resulted from a general push for performance with the power unit and that they can be resolved over the winter. We mustnt forget that at the beginning of the year we set out  and this was before I was here but I think it was the right decision on the powertrain side  to err on the side of performance he said said. Because the powertrain was going to be frozen. So we made a conscious decision to push the performance envelope and fix reliability issues as we got to them because the FIA allows that. So that was a conscious and strategic decision. And now when we face them we can fix them. We didnt do it on purpose to not be reliable. But if you have to err on that side you push the performance boundary because you cant add performance now until 2026 you can fix reliability issues. And we can do it over the winter. So strategically I think it was the right thing to do. And we still have two races left to finish in fourth. I think we can do that. Asked by Motorsport.com if it was frustrating to lose valuable points in Mexico he said Ill tell you my frustration after Abu Dhabi For sure you want to score more points. Fernando Alonso Alpine F1 Team climbs out of his car after retiring from the race Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images Szafnauer acknowledged that it doesnt matter what margin Alpine beats McLaren by as long as the team can stay in front. No not at this point. And then over the winter well make even more reliability improvements. You cant improve the performance it is what it is. And well be better off. But weve got to remember this powertrain has to last until 2026. So for sure it was the right strategy. I think were on a good trajectory. And lets see what next year brings. But the short term is reliability in the next few races finish strong and I think our performance will be there. Szafnauer says that the Renault engine division in ViryChatillon knows what it has to do having fixed other issues earlier in the season. Yeah more than I do for example he said. So I was asking them about the Mexico cylinder failure. And then although I spent seven and a half years at Honda powertrains theyve got a much deeper understanding and theyll figure it out. But like I said strategically thats what we set out to do. Every time we have an issue we fix it. It doesnt come back. So this was a little bit different than what we had in Singapore.

'Magnussen could lose his seat instead' - Schumacher on Haas' driver line-up, https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1016267/1/magnussen-could-lose-his-seat-instead-schumacher-haas-driver-lineup, Haas have yet to decide who will complete their F1 driver lineup for next season. Magnussen has a multiyear deal with the team while the second seat is between Mick Schumacher and Nico Hulkenberg. Since the Austrian Grand Prix Schumacher has often been the quicker of the two Haas drivers particularly on a Sunday. Speaking to Sky Germany Ralf said that Magnussens seat should also be under threat for next season. In the last race Mexcio Mick was sometimes up to sixtenths faster than Magnussen  so lets wait and see for the next few races., Haas have yet to decide who will complete their F1 driver lineup for next season. Magnussen has a multiyear deal with the team while the second seat is between Mick Schumacher and Nico Hulkenberg. Despite impressing on his return at the seasonopening Bahrain Grand Prix Magnussens form has dipped in the second half of the season. Since the Austrian Grand Prix Schumacher has often been the quicker of the two Haas drivers particularly on a Sunday. Speaking to Sky Germany Ralf said that Magnussens seat should also be under threat for next season. Anything is possible of course especially if we look at the last few races he said. Who knows Magnussen may not be so firmly in the seat anymore. If we look at the races since Silverstone we have to conclude that Mick is the more stable and better of the two drivers  and who has also had some bad luck with wrong strategies. In the last race Mexcio Mick was sometimes up to sixtenths faster than Magnussen  so lets wait and see for the next few races. I hope Haas make a decision soon. Maybe next year we will have two Germans on the Formula 1 grid. Recently team boss Guenther Steiner explained that its still 5050 on who will drive for the team alongside Magnussen in 2023. Im honest Its still 5050 he explained. Nothing has been decided yet he said. We will logically not make a decision between Austin and Mexico simply because time is not there. The next time would be the week after Mexico because we dont have a race then and have more time to deal with it.

Why Hamilton changed his mind about racing in F1 after 40, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/why-hamilton-changed-his-mind-about-racing-in-f1-after-40/10394765/, Why is a driver who is so determined to make an impact beyond what he does ontrack keen to keep on racing Hamilton admitted in Mexico last week that he wasnt sure what had changed his mind on wanting to keep racing after being 40. Thats been a really interesting process and Im grateful to be a part of it said Hamilton. I get asked every day to do so many different things and Im able to push back and say no. I think theres more stuff to achieve together.Lewis Hamilton Mercedes AMG 2nd position with his trophy Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images, Listen to this article Hamilton has often joked that he does not want to be the oldest driver on the grid embracing the continued contract extensions for Fernando Alonso who at 41 is preparing to keep on racing for at least a few more years. More seriously Hamilton has always vowed that he would not want to keep on racing until he is totally burnt out instead wishing to bow out when he is still fresh and has the energy to focus on other projects. Mission 44 his charity dedicated to improving representation in motorsport and Ignite a charity set up with Mercedes also intended to aid diversity are two such interests that will be the focus of his postracing life ensuring he has a legacy that goes beyond his ontrack achievements. But after Hamilton revealed in a group media interview including Motorsport.com in Austin last month that he plans to sign a new multiyear contract with Mercedes it led to a fresh look at where he currently stands in F1. His existing deal expires at the end of 2023 by when he will be 38. Even if he went on for only another two years that would take him close to his 41st birthday passing a milestone he once scoffed at. So whats changed for Hamilton Why is a driver who is so determined to make an impact beyond what he does ontrack keen to keep on racing Hamilton admitted in Mexico last week that he wasnt sure what had changed his mind on wanting to keep racing after being 40. He mentioned this narrative of winding down towards the end as being something he did not subscribe to and that even with his outside interests the support of Mercedes to pursue them could keep him energised ontrack. Im just in a happy place said Hamilton. Im a lot more grounded Ive got my home that I get to spend time in in the UK when I come to see the team for example my family come down. I have a lot better setup just all round. And I feel like I can take the team to more championships. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes AMG Photo by Steve Etherington  Motorsport Images Hamilton has always made clear that breaking the record for the most championships by winning an eighth title is not something that will define his future even given the circumstances of his defeat to Max Verstappen last year. He has often talked about the journey Mercedes now finds itself on trying to return to the top after being toppled amid its struggles with the new technical regulations for 2022. Walking away while the team is yet to return to the top of the mountain does not seem to be something on Hamiltons radar. Hamilton admitted it was difficult to say how much of an impact the struggles of this year had on his motivation to keep going. If wed had a year like last year and we were competing at the front all year who knows where I would be he pondered. But he spoke of the energy he took from seeing the team come together in 2022 noting the new level vulnerability he has seen in many of his colleagues through the current struggles. Thats been a really interesting process and Im grateful to be a part of it said Hamilton. I cant wait for the time that we get back to success that we finally get that win and we get that championship. Its going to make all these tough moments worthwhile. As Hamilton has gotten further into his 30s he has often spoken of his improved physical condition citing his switch to a plantbased diet in 2018 as being a life changer. When it comes to his training he has also learned to adjust his regimen as the years have gone on as it gets harder for all of us to stay in peak physical condition. So its about being more meticulous with your diet being more meticulous with your training said Hamilton. Like for example I did pilates with a good friend of mine the other day thats an Olympic athlete and it was so funny because it was something that wed never really done before. Id done pilates but just adding different things that you wouldnt normally do being more specific with your daily routine way more than when I was 22  I wasnt doing the things that Im doing today. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes AMG Photo by Steve Etherington  Motorsport Images Hamilton also noted the importance of looked after his mental wellbeing to find good balance within your life including setting boundaries to protect his energy and prevent himself getting overloaded. I never let that get to that point Hamilton explained. Its just about being balanced. I say no to so many things. I get asked every day to do so many different things and Im able to push back and say no. If I know thats going to affect my preparation getting in the way of my training or my time with my team or have any possible impact on my race weekend its a big no. Thats with friends thats with relationships. This is what Im focused on. It has all given Hamilton the kind of longevity that very few athletes will ever enjoy. Two tennis icons Serena Williams and Roger Federer hung up their rackets this year after playing into their early 40s. Tom Brady a friend of Hamiltons has managed to extend his career in the NFL well into his 40s despite the physical demands of the game. All of them act as inspiration to Hamilton. Toto Wolff Hamiltons team principal at Mercedes felt the Brady comparison was apt. For me the best athlete in the world Tom Brady hes on the field and being tackled and throwing the ball and hes 43 years old he said. So as long as you continue to look after yourself and develop your cognitive sensors I think Hamilton has many more years in him. Im pretty certain thats going to be the case here in the team. Wolff plans to sit down with Hamilton during a quiet time over the winter to discuss his next contract which is set to run to at least the end of the 2025 season. The way that Hamilton is talking there is no reason why it has to be his last F1 renewal  and why turning 40 could be long in the past by the time he finally calls it quits. Im not putting a limit on it to be honest Hamilton said when asked how much longer he planned to stay with Mercedes only confirming he was planning to do a multiyear deal with my team. I really really dont know what the next five years hold I think were still trying to work on that he added. Theres a lot of great things that are being put in place like Ive just launched a production company this week. But I feel great in mind and body. I think theres more stuff to achieve together.

Formula 1 fans frustrated at unavailable tickets skyrocketing hotel prices, https://www.fox5vegas.com/2022/11/04/formula-1-fans-frustrated-unavailable-tickets-skyrocketing-hotel-prices/, There were no tickets available all of my friends who tried the exact same thing and its so frustrating said Doreen Thieven. Ticket prices are also not 500 as was said following the major announcement. Hotel prices are skyrocketing. As for fans you may want to get your hotel stay first then worry about the tickets later. Thats what Doreen is going to do Im going to wait a week before the Grand Prix just pray and hope the ticket prices go down Thieven added., LAS VEGAS Nev. FOX5  Formula 1 released a statement Thursday afternoon saying that the priority list presale allotment has sold out due to overwhelming demand. Formula 1 fans are in what feels like a neverending pitstop. There were no tickets available all of my friends who tried the exact same thing and its so frustrating said Doreen Thieven. This is a common theme as people navigate the F1 site to buy tickets. Priority fans donated 7.77 earlier this year to be early and also for American Express cardholders both of which Thieven was a part of. I was on cue and I was really on time I was early at my laptop super excited and then I finally got the word I could purchase and for every seat I clicked it said sorry another fan was faster than you said Thieven. Ticket prices are also not 500 as was said following the major announcement. They said it was 500 I checked general admission standing only starts at 500 and I was exactly in that category when I clicked it I couldnt see it the lowest ticket I saw was 2000 said Thieven. For fans that wasnt the only frustrating part. Hotel prices are skyrocketing. At Caesars Palace suites are going for close to 19000 a night. The cheapest is not even on the Strip. Sunset Station in Henderson is estimated to be up to 600 a night. Many hotels are booked up for that weekend including The Strat Cosmopolitan and the Wynn. As for fans you may want to get your hotel stay first then worry about the tickets later. Thats what Doreen is going to do Im going to wait a week before the Grand Prix just pray and hope the ticket prices go down Thieven added. Copyright 2022 KVVU. All rights reserved.
Mick Schumacher "belongs in Formula 1" as former driver lashes out at Guenther Steiner, https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/schumacher-criticism-steiner-haas-seat-28404878, Schumacher could drop out of F1 after just two years with Haas as team boss Steiner weighs up whether or not to replace him with the more experience Nico HulkenbergA former Formula 1 driver took aim at Guenther Steiner over his useless criticism of Mick Schumacher as he advocated for the German to keep his Haas seat. Schumacher as about to complete his second season in the sport both with Haas after being signed as a rookie for the 2021 campaign. I also say very clearly that Mick belongs in Formula 1. Guenther Steiner was wrong to unnecessarily put Mick under pressure with useless criticism. Meanwhile Ralf Schumacher suggested the idea that instead of choosing between the two Haas should axe Kevin Magnussen and hire both., Schumacher could drop out of F1 after just two years with Haas as team boss Steiner weighs up whether or not to replace him with the more experience Nico Hulkenberg A former Formula 1 driver took aim at Guenther Steiner over his useless criticism of Mick Schumacher as he advocated for the German to keep his Haas seat. Schumacher as about to complete his second season in the sport both with Haas after being signed as a rookie for the 2021 campaign. He is now waiting nervously to find out whether he will have a third with his contract expiring at the end of this year. Haas have been in no rush to make a decision on his future. His seat is the final one on the 2023 grid to be decided with Steiner believed to be considering a more experienced option in the form of Nico Hulkenberg. With Audi entering the sport in 2026 joining forces with Sauber it has been suggested Schumacher would be a top target for the German manufacturer. But dropping out of the sport before then would surely harm his chances of that ever coming into fruition. HansJoachim Stuck who started 74 F1 races across a sixyear career in the sport believes his compatriot is deserving of his spot in the sport. Unfortunately for Mick it is still too early for Audi because they will not be there until 2026 the 71yearold told ServusTV. If he is not confirmed at Haas he will no longer be in Formula 1. This is very clear. I also say very clearly that Mick belongs in Formula 1. Image XPB ImagesPA Images XPB ImagesPA Images A young driver sometimes has to make some mistakes because he doesnt know what the limit of the car is. Guenther Steiner was wrong to unnecessarily put Mick under pressure with useless criticism. Its crazy to have a seat and not confirm Mick. If he gets the right car he will be great in the future. Hulkenberg who has not held a race seat since 2019 said of the situation this week  At the end of the day its not my decision. Im not making it. There are still talks. I am relatively optimistic but we will have to be patient a little longer. Meanwhile Ralf Schumacher suggested the idea that instead of choosing between the two Haas should axe Kevin Magnussen and hire both. I hope Haas make a decision soon.

Nikita Mazepin has surprise new career after his F1 hopes went up in flames, https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/nikita-mazepin-career-now-dj-28404414, But Haas quickly made the decision to cut ties with both Mazepin and sponsor Uralkali the company owned by his oligarch father. Perhaps aware he will struggle to find another drive in motorsport it appears Mazepin has turned his attention to other ventures. After one of the photos was shared across social media some F1 fans couldnt resist poking fun at the Russian. Mazepin has previously suggested he could one day return to F1  but not with Haas after accusing team principal Guenther Steiner of lacking human qualities. I think one day I will be in F1 as a businessman but there is no hurry., Mazepin managed just one season in Formula 1 with Haas before he was unceremoniously sacked by the team in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February Nikita Mazepin has surprise new career after his F1 hopes went up in flames Nikita Mazepin looks to have embarked on a new career as an events planner after being axed from Formula 1. The Russian racer made his F1 debut with Haas but failed to score a single point during the 2021 season as the team fielded two entirely uncompetitive cars. He was set to be given a second crack alongside Mick Schumacher this year but things changed after Russia launched their invasion of Ukraine. The FIA made it clear drivers from Russia would still be allowed to compete provided they did not represent their country and did not voice any support of their countrys belligerence. But Haas quickly made the decision to cut ties with both Mazepin and sponsor Uralkali the company owned by his oligarch father. Perhaps aware he will struggle to find another drive in motorsport it appears Mazepin has turned his attention to other ventures. His latest seems to be an event planning firm called The Ninety Nine Events which threw a big Halloweenthemed bash this week. Photos published on his Instagram account show partygoers in fancy dress enjoying themselves in front of a large screen with Mazepins surname displayed in large letters. Another snap shows the former racer wearing headphones while operating DJ decks. This year I had to say goodbye to Formula 1 for a while he wrote in the caption. But in order to open up to something different it is important to come to terms with setbacks and trouble. If one path for selfexpression is closed then you need to look for another. For the first time I come before you in such a role. Its great that you can discover new frontiers and find opportunities for development in your own projects. After one of the photos was shared across social media some F1 fans couldnt resist poking fun at the Russian. Cant spin a car anymore so hes spinning tracks instead wrote one in reference to the Mazespin nickname he was given by some over his habit of losing control of his car during his one and only F1 season. He probably crashed the computer he was playing the music on joked another. Mazepin has previously suggested he could one day return to F1  but not with Haas after accusing team principal Guenther Steiner of lacking human qualities. He said When a team boss behaves like that then I think there are nine other teams with whom I can have a dialogue. I think one day I will be in F1 as a businessman but there is no hurry.

Why Formula 1's overseer was right to penalise Red Bull, https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/11/03/why-formula-1s-overseer-was-right-to-penalise-red-bull, In 2021 the FIA introduced a cap on teams spending to try to increase competition on the grid. In that year the big prize the drivers championship was won in controversial circumstances by Max Verstappen while his team Red Bull came second in the constructors competition. Several weeks ago the FIA announced that Red Bull had breached the spending cap that season. Red Bull reacted furiously insisting it had complied with the rules. Zak Brown chief executive of McLaren accused Red Bull of cheating and demanded financial and sporting penalties., AS MANY PARENTS know to their cost empty threats are woefully ineffective. Once children twig that mum or dad is unwilling to follow through with the denial of pocket money or confinement to the house authority is lost. The lesson is a useful one for sporting authorities too. One that seems to have learned it is the Fdration Internationale de lAutomobile  FIA  the governing body of Formula 1 motor racing. And one that needs to is UEFA  which supposedly rules over European football. In 2021 the FIA introduced a cap on teams spending to try to increase competition on the grid. Constructors were limited to spending 145m on research and development and on building and testing cars. Other expenses such as drivers salaries and marketing were exempt. In that year the big prize the drivers championship was won in controversial circumstances by Max Verstappen while his team Red Bull came second in the constructors competition. Several weeks ago the FIA announced that Red Bull had breached the spending cap that season. The breachspending up to 5 above the capwas the second most serious of the four categories. The Aston Martin team was also found to be in breach but in a lesser procedural category. Red Bull reacted furiously insisting it had complied with the rules. Its rivals were furious too. Zak Brown chief executive of McLaren accused Red Bull of cheating and demanded financial and sporting penalties. When the FIA handed down Red Bulls punishment at the end of October it predictably satisfied no one. It fined the team 7m a good deal more than the sum by which it had overspent and cut the amount of time it will be allowed to spend on aerodynamic testing over the next 12 months by 10. Red Bulls boss Christian Horner called the penalties draconian and complained that the reduction in windtunnel time would hurt his teams competitiveness. Meanwhile his counterpart at Mercedes Toto Wolff said that the punishment was too little. Yet having tightened its rules the FIA acted in the only way that made senseeven if people on either side might grumble that it was too severe or too lenient. The weakness of its counterpart in European football provides a contrasting and cautionary tale. A decade ago with Europes big clubs spending ever more on players some of them recklessly UEFA drew up financial fair play  FFP  rules. It declared that teams annual expenditure on player transfers and wages should not exceed revenues from broadcasting ticket and commercial activities by more than 5m then 5.7m. Two of Europes most wellheeled clubs Paris St Germain and Manchester City which are both financed by petrodollars were soon investigated for suspected breaches. In both cases UEFA was concerned that the clubs outlays on players could not be justified by their income which appeared to have been inflated by sponsorship deals with companies linked to their Middle Eastern owners. Yet in 2018 UEFA concluded that PSGs deals just about complied with the rules. To reach this conclusion UEFA accepted valuations assessed by firms hired by the club rather than the much lower sums proposed by analysts commissioned by the governing body itself. UEFA did ban Manchester City from European competition for two years and fined the club 30mbut the next year the Court of Arbitration for Sport the highest legal body in sport overturned the ban and cut the fine to 10m not enough to buy a secondrate centrehalf. That wasnt because the CAS found that City had kept to the rules but because UEFA had taken too long to investigate. FFP became a laughing stock. It was quietly scrapped and in mid2022 was replaced with new regulations. By the middle of the decade clubs will have to limit spending on wages transfers and agents to 70 of revenue. This will mean big changes to the business models of many clubs. But the effectiveness of the regulations will depend entirely on UEFA s appetite for bringing transgressors to heel. UEFA may fear that if it tries to be harsh big clubs will set up their own competitions as they have previously threatened to do.

Step Aside Lewis Hamilton Formula 1 Has Entered the Max Verstappen Era, https://www.autoweek.com/racing/formula-1/a41854877/step-aside-lewis-hamilton-formula-1-has-entered-the-max-verstappen-era/, Haas F1 team principal Guenther Steiner says that F1 has turned the page on Lewis Hamilton and its now the Max Verstappen era. Modern Formula 1 has gone from the Michael Schumacher era to the Sebastian Vettel era to Lewis Hamilton era to a new era according to Haas F1 team principal Guenther Steiner. Steiner says welcome to the Max Verstappen era. In this era its just Max Steiner told the German broadcaster NTV. Formula has a new king of the mountain and its Max Verstappen., Haas F1 team principal Guenther Steiner says that F1 has turned the page on Lewis Hamilton and its now the Max Verstappen era. Verstappen follows the dynasties of Michael Schumacher seven championships Sebastian Vettel four championships and Hamilton seven championships. Red Bull consultant Dr. Helmut Marko says it might be to early to pencil in Verstappen for a long run of championships. Modern Formula 1 has gone from the Michael Schumacher era to the Sebastian Vettel era to Lewis Hamilton era to a new era according to Haas F1 team principal Guenther Steiner. Steiner says welcome to the Max Verstappen era. Although the 2021 season finale and this years budget cap scandal muddied Verstappens achievements Steiner says the Verstappen era is similar to the Hamilton Vettel and Schumacher eras that preceded it. Every era has its champion. In this era its just Max Steiner told the German broadcaster NTV. We are right in the middle of that era now. Hes got the talent the drive hes just a master at the moment. Formula has a new king of the mountain and its Max Verstappen. NurPhoto Getty Images As for who might challenge Verstappens superiority next year Steiner answered I think Charles Leclercs driving skills are very good at the moment. But sometimes he still makes mistakesa little too many mistakes. And Max just doesnt make them anywhere. Steiner also believes that seventime world champion Lewis Hamilton is still good. Max however is the man now. To be champion you need that little bit extra. A certain coolness a certain extra bit of luck too Steiner said. Max is just riding a wave at the moment and he doesnt want to get off it. Some however say Verstappens dominance is already boring. Take the cakewalk Verstappen had in Mexico where only two cars were within 49 seconds of him at the finish. When asked about that Red Bull consultant Dr. Helmut Marko told Osterreich Unfortunately we cant take that into account. For the rest Max delivers anything but boring races. In Austria for example his races are rewarded with top ratings. Marko though doesnt expect Verstappens current level of dominance to carry over into 2023. We approach the matter realistically said the 79yearold Austrian. It is indeed amazing how the season has turned out. You couldnt have predicted that Max would be in such form. Unfortunately its not enough for the 19 wins in one season Marko added referring to Mercedes win total as a team in 2016. When told that Red Bull could target that for 2023 Marko answered I hardly think its possible for everything to fit together like this for another season. However Max has not yet reached the end of his development. He is even more mature faster tirefriendly. Theres still incredible room for improvement.
Sainz praises Verstappen for ‘evolving in every single area’ en route to successive F1 world titles, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.sainz-praises-verstappen-for-evolving-in-every-single-area-en-route-to.56ZsXtiPQr8uRsNKgKkPej.html, Carlos Sainz has added to the words of praise sent in Max Verstappens direction after the Dutchman secured his second F1 title noting how much he believes his former team mate has improved over the years. Verstappen made his F1 debut alongside Sainz at Toro Rosso back in 2015 the two drivers spending just over a season together before the Dutchman secured promotion to the senior Red Bull team and embarked on a winning journey. Since then Verstappen has racked up 19 pole positions 34 victories and his aforementioned backtoback championships while Sainz has found a new home at Ferrari  leading to plenty more battles between the pair this time at the front of the F1 field.

Room for one more F1 race in the Americas says Mexican GP promoter, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/room-for-one-more-f1-race-in-the-americas-says-mexican-gp-promoter/10394392/, With grands prix also taking place in Canada and Brazil there will be six races in the Americas in 2023. So I think thats good for the region for the timezone that is very good. So with Canada three races in the United States Mexico and Brazil the question is if there room for another one Its a great show and a great window to present Mexico in a good fashion to the world. I would rather to have a race every other year than have no race at all., Listen to this article Last weekends race at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez in Mexico City attracted a sellout crowd of 397000 fans over three days once again making it one of the bestattended races of the season. The continued strong fan presence in Mexico comes amid F1s current boom in the neighbouring United States which will host three races next year in Miami Austin and Las Vegas. With grands prix also taking place in Canada and Brazil there will be six races in the Americas in 2023. But amid continued interest from countries in hosting a grand prix in the future Alejandro Soberon the chief executive of CIE that promotes the race in Mexico felt there would be scope to add another event in the Americas. We love competition its good because it keeps you in shape and alert said Soberon. Three races in the States before it was unthinkable. Today it even looks reasonable. I think Miami is going to be a very big success. You saw the attendance in Austin. Its much better than other years its a stronger race. And all the presales in Vegas are through the roof. So I think thats good for the region for the timezone that is very good. So with Canada three races in the United States Mexico and Brazil the question is if there room for another one My personal belief is there is room for another one. But it doesnt have to go against another race in the same timezone. It can go against another timezone. So whos going to be at risk how competitive is that offer Its going to be very interesting. Lance Stroll Aston Martin waves to the crowd on the drivers parade Photo by Sam Bloxham  Motorsport Images Mexico announced on Thursday that it had signed a new threeyear contract ensuring F1 will continue to visit the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez until at least 2025. But Soberon explained that come the next renewal there could be a new government and city mayor in place following the elections in 2024. Mexico initially returned to the calendar in 2015 with a deal that was funded by the federal government but a change in the government meant the Mexico City mayor and her administration took over securing the funding for the race for the existing deal and the renewal. Soberon felt confident the grand prix would continue to get national support regardless of the ruling bodies believing everyone in the country was very proud about the race. They love Checo Perez what hes achieving said Soberon. Its a great show and a great window to present Mexico in a good fashion to the world. Today there are more and more cities interested in getting a slot on the calendar. I think that basically means that everybody needs to move faster trying to make the alliance of interest to make it happen because I think Formula 1 is in a great position today. F1 will hold a recordbreaking 24race season in 2023 reaching the limit set out by the Concorde Agreement after adding a new event in Las Vegas as well as bringing China and Qatar back to the schedule. Series bosses are known to be exploring calendar rotation as a potential way to ensure more markets particularly those in Europe can hold events every other year. Asked about the possibility of Mexico rotating in the future if required Soberon said When you have every year sold out and every year you sell it faster than the year before its something as a promoter you dont want to consider. Why should I have every other year a race when I can have one every year Im very competitive I deliver good dollars to Formula 1 and its a great market the Mexican market has a lot to do with the success in the States. The Hispanic population is very fond of races there. But you know for some countries that cannot manage to have the right funding certainly its going to be an option to do. I would rather to have a race every other year than have no race at all.
Ricciardo has felt like "a passenger" at times amid McLaren F1 struggles, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/ricciardo-has-felt-like-a-passenger-at-times-amid-mclaren-f1-struggles/10394515/, Ricciardo admitted that it was the first time he had felt so comfortable with the 2022 car. Not to be negative I dont even want to look ahead I just want to take today for what it is. So just to have an attacking race and especially for me with this car to feel like I can attack a little bit more with it its just a nice feeling. Explaining his turnaround in form Ricciardo was pleased to bounce back in style after feeling so frustrated after the US race. So thats where its just I felt a little bit helpless at times., The Australian put in his best performance of the year in Mexico City last weekend using a successful mediumsoft tyre strategy that gave him the pace to charge up to seventh place  while negating a 10second penalty for colliding with Yuki Tsunoda. The race came just a week after one of Ricciardos most disappointing outings of the season in Austin where he finished a lowly 16th 10 places behind teammate Lando Norris. Ricciardo admitted that it was the first time he had felt so comfortable with the 2022 car. I guess better late than never he said. Im going to take today for what it is Im going to enjoy it and appreciate that we did our pace and it was awesome and whatever. I hope it means that itll be like that the next two races. Not to be negative I dont even want to look ahead I just want to take today for what it is. And hopefully weve learned something from it. Even the points finishes even probably last year I feel we were normally defending rather than attacking. So just to have an attacking race and especially for me with this car to feel like I can attack a little bit more with it its just a nice feeling. Explaining his turnaround in form Ricciardo was pleased to bounce back in style after feeling so frustrated after the US race. Daniel Ricciardo McLaren MCL36 Photo by Mark Sutton  Motorsport Images Of course its not typical in a place like Austin for me to feel like that he said after the flag in Mexico. Theres so much about that weekend that I love. So it has to be pretty bad for me to feel like that in a place like that. Its just theres been a lot of times where Ive felt a little bit like a passenger in a way I just feel like Ive worked with such little grip that no amount of talent is going to get the job done if you know what I mean. So thats where its just I felt a little bit helpless at times. So you feel like you cant show really anything that youve got because youre just not operating on the level of the others. So today to kind of be able to at least lean on it and push and have pace and be a guy thats setting quick times makes me happy. I wish it could have been like this more often. But Ill take today and enjoy it and Im happy weve got a week off so I can enjoy it for a week. Asked by Autosport if he felt that hed proved a point Ricciardo said I still know I can get the job done its hard when you cant do it week in and week out. Its a bit like Sebastian Vettel those last few races he did phenomenal races and then people are questioning is it time to retire I think all of us can still do it on our day. Obviously its just the consistency for whatever reason. But I still love it. And I still want to get to the front.

In June 2021 Tezos who had already partnered with Red Bull Racing announced a partnership with F1 team McClaren Racing. But sports partnerships in Web3 have been a mixed bag with only a handful of successful ventures. In June 2022 FTX confirmed that it had pulled out of discussions to sponsor a jersey patch with the Los Angeles Angels telling Decrypt it wasnt the right fit for their marketing goals. They said that the decision was not the result of the recent market downturn. Rival exchange Crypto.com saw its own sports league sponsorship deals hit a snag in August 2022 when it pulled out of a 495 Million sponsorship deal with the European Champions League UEFA. The Crypto.com deal came after UEFAs previous sponsorship deal with Russian natural gas company Gazprom was canceled by the league after the Russian invasion of Ukraine earlier this year. But Guenther Steiner Team Principal of Haas F1 Team is confident in its partnership with OpenSea. Weve waited to find the right partner in the NFT space and in OpenSea weve found exactly that Steiner said Its going to be exciting for us to take our first steps into the NFT environment and engage with OpenSeas passionate community.
Mercedes would prefer F1 race win over second in constructors' standings, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/mercedes-would-prefer-f1-race-win-over-second-in-constructors-standings/10394378/, But its consistency allied to recent improvements has left it in contention to overhaul Ferrari for second place in the teams battle behind Red Bull. Mercedes is currently lying in third place in the overall standings 40 points behind its Maranello rival. The win would be proof that our car is back to fight for wins he said when asked why he felt that way. P2 could also be because the others dropped the ball and youre just scoring more points.Lewis Hamilton took another second place behind Max Verstappen as Red Bull scored a ninth consecutive victory in Mexico. We are racing for a win racing for both cars on the podium the Ferraris are behind us., The German manufacturer has endured a challenging 2022 campaign and despite having got one pole position this year is at risk of not winning a race for the first time since 2011. But its consistency allied to recent improvements has left it in contention to overhaul Ferrari for second place in the teams battle behind Red Bull. Mercedes is currently lying in third place in the overall standings 40 points behind its Maranello rival. While the runnerup slot would be a good end result to a year that started with such difficulties Wolff says that he would actually prefer it to round off the season with a victory rather than stepping up a world constructors championship position. The win would be proof that our car is back to fight for wins he said when asked why he felt that way. P2 could also be because the others dropped the ball and youre just scoring more points. Lewis Hamilton took another second place behind Max Verstappen as Red Bull scored a ninth consecutive victory in Mexico. Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images While Wolff would not be against overtaking Ferrari in the points table he says that the better judge of the teams progress is how its car is performing on track. It would definitely be some consolation because Ferrari had the quickest car at the beginning of the season he said about the runnerup spot. Finishing ahead of them would be great but again its not our main priority. The main priority is to understand the car and have a quick automobile on the track. Mercedes had two of its best chances of the year to grab that win in the recent United States and Mexican Grands Prix but tyre strategy choices compromised its chances on both occasions. However considering the scale of the problems that the team faced at the beginning of the season Wolff is happy about the level of progress made  even though there are tinges of disappointment about the Austin and Mexico chances that got away. The thing is we are racers and the moment we can kind of see it in front of us we just want to grab it he said. Therefore there is always a sense of frustration. But we have come from such a long way and here we are. We are racing for a win racing for both cars on the podium the Ferraris are behind us. So you need to stay humble and of what we achieved while still reaching for the stars. Photo by Steve Etherington  Motorsport Images Mercedes feels it has a good understanding of what went wrong with its W13 this year and what needs addressing for 2023 as it looks poised to switch concept. However Wolff says there can be no complacency that the changes that are planned will guarantee it being back at the front of the field. Im never confident he said. I always see the glass half empty. So there is nothing to really see it positive. Ive just heard nine wins in a row for Red Bull so there is no reason to be overwhelmed with finishing second and fourth. We have a long way to catch up. We have the winter. I think were doing some good development on the car. Some of the things we are finding might be bigger steps than just adding a few steps of downforce. But were giving it whatever we have and more in order to bring us back into the position to fight for a championship.
Bottas to make Race of Champions debut alongside Hakkinen in 2023, https://www.crash.net/f1/news/1016187/1/bottas-make-race-champions-debut-alongside-hakkinen-2023, The 10time grand prix winner will participate in the 2023 iteration driving for Team Finland in the ROC Nations Cup January 28 alongside twotime F1 champion and fellow Finn Mika Hakkinen. Bottas will also drive in the individual Race of Champions on January 29. Im also thrilled to be able to partner Mika Hakkinen for Team Finland in the ROC Nations Cup. Then well have to put our friendship aside again and try to beat each other in the individual Race Of Champions. I might tell Valtteri before the ROC Nations Cup but only if he promises to have forgotten it by the individual race the next day, Bottas was set to make his debut at the 2022 event but was forced to withdraw days before it started. The 10time grand prix winner will participate in the 2023 iteration driving for Team Finland in the ROC Nations Cup January 28 alongside twotime F1 champion and fellow Finn Mika Hakkinen. Bottas will also drive in the individual Race of Champions on January 29. F1 retiree Sebastian Vettel and threetime W Series champion Jamie Chadwick are also confirmed for the event. Speaking of the news Bottas said Im really looking forward to being able to make my Race Of Champions debut at last. Ive watched the event on TV for many years and I came so close to competing last year until I had to pull out at the last minute. It was tough watching everyone having so much fun throwing their cars around on the snow and ice in Sweden so Im glad I will now be joining them at Pite Havsbad in January. Im also thrilled to be able to partner Mika Hakkinen for Team Finland in the ROC Nations Cup. I have become good friends with Mika over the years but it will be a special treat to be able to race alongside him. Weve both taken part in the Arctic Rally a few times so hopefully that can help us beat our Nordic neighbours  and everyone else. Then well have to put our friendship aside again and try to beat each other in the individual Race Of Champions. Whatever happens Im sure we will put on a great show for all the fans watching at the track and around the world. Hakkinen added Its great that Valtteri will be joining us at the Race Of Champions in January. I was expecting to pair up with him for Team Finland last year so all I can say is better late than never I can assure him the Race Of Champions really is as fun as it looks and to race on the snow and ice is brilliant. As we both grew up in about the only country thats even colder than Pite Havsbad we should have a chance. As for the secret to success I might tell Valtteri before the ROC Nations Cup but only if he promises to have forgotten it by the individual race the next day

Horner: "Hugely worrying" that news of Red Bull's F1 budget cap breach leaked, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/horner-hugely-worrying-that-news-of-red-bulls-f1-budget-cap-breach-leaked/10394371/, It brought an end to the cost cap saga that first emerged over the Singapore Grand Prix weekend in late September when the first whispers emerged that Red Bull had breached the budget cap. Red Bull was only officially informed that it had breached the cost cap on the Sunday of the Japanese Grand Prix 90 minutes after Max Verstappen clinched his second world title. Reflecting on the case in Mexico following the FIAs ruling Horner said he expected followup action to investigate why news of Red Bulls breach had leaked out. The accusations made in Singapore were extremely upsetting for every single member of staff all our partners everyone involved within Red Bull said Horner. Christian Horner Team Principal Red Bull Racing in a press conference regarding the recent findings of the cost cap breach., Listen to this article Red Bull reached a settlement with the FIA over its 1.8 million breach of last years budget cap ahead of the Mexican Grand Prix arguing that it misinterpreted some of the permitted exclusions. The team was hit with a 7m fine and a 10 reduction in its permitted aerodynamic development for the next 12 months a sanction Horner called enormous and draconian. It brought an end to the cost cap saga that first emerged over the Singapore Grand Prix weekend in late September when the first whispers emerged that Red Bull had breached the budget cap. Horner hit back emphatically against the accusations when they were first made as well as calling out rivals for making defamatory claims without any official information from the FIA. Red Bull was only officially informed that it had breached the cost cap on the Sunday of the Japanese Grand Prix 90 minutes after Max Verstappen clinched his second world title. A public notice was then issued one day later. Reflecting on the case in Mexico following the FIAs ruling Horner said he expected followup action to investigate why news of Red Bulls breach had leaked out. The accusations made in Singapore were extremely upsetting for every single member of staff all our partners everyone involved within Red Bull said Horner. Obviously any form of leakage is hugely worrying. Its something that we expect to be followed up. Prior to the Accepted Breach Agreement being struck between Red Bull and the FIA a number of the teams rivals had been clear in the calls for strong action. Christian Horner Team Principal Red Bull Racing in a press conference regarding the recent findings of the cost cap breach. The FIA have handed Red Bull a 7m fine and an aero testing reduction Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images McLaren boss Zak Brown wrote to FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem and F1 president Stefano Domenicali to say that any possible breach of the cost cap constitutes cheating something Horner fiercely hit back against in Austin. Horner said after the FIAs ruling that he felt Red Bull was probably due an apology from some of our rivals for some of the claims that theyve made and that the team would make no apology for the way that weve performed the way that weve acted. Horner added We do take on the chin that there are lessons to be made. Potentially mistakes have been made in our submission which with the benefit of hindsight and 2020 vision everybody can be a specialist. But there was no intent there was nothing dishonest and there was certainly no cheating involved which has been alleged in certain quarters. So I dont feel that we need to apologise. I think there are lessons that have been learned. Everybody can learn from this. Weve taken our pounding in public weve taken a very public pounding through the accusations that have been made by other teams. Our drivers have been booed at circuits. And the reputational damage that has been made by allegations has been significant. The time has come for that to stop.
F1 teams in discussions to add second factory shutdown during winter � RaceFans, https://www.racefans.net/2022/11/03/f1-teams-in-discussions-to-add-second-factory-shutdown-during-winter/, Formula 1 teams are working on introducing a winter factory shutdown similar to the current summer shutdown period for 2023. Following regulations introduced in 2013 teams have been mandated to restrict factory work for 14 days to both save costs and also relieve pressure on staff giving them time to go on holidays. The shutdown is now a core part of F1 and has become more important as the schedule has grown. But for the race team thats clocking many air miles thats positive. So if you dont force that shutdown you dont get any time off.Advert  Become a RaceFans supporter and go adfree2022 F1 season, Formula 1 teams are working on introducing a winter factory shutdown similar to the current summer shutdown period for 2023. Following regulations introduced in 2013 teams have been mandated to restrict factory work for 14 days to both save costs and also relieve pressure on staff giving them time to go on holidays. The break usually takes place in August when F1 has a gap of several weeks in the race schedule. All performancerelated work is stopped but departments or roles that focus on human resources logistics and finances and also media and marketing are allowed to continue work. The shutdown is now a core part of F1 and has become more important as the schedule has grown. In 2013 19 races were held but the 2023 F1 calendar features a recordbreaking 24 rounds. This year marks the first time since 2018 that the season has finished before December but racing will start almost two weeks earlier than usual in 2023 as the world championship begins on March 5th. The last time F1 began that early was in 2002 and only starting before March 5th twice in the 19 years before that. I think its great that the season finishes this couple of weeks earlier than in the past because everyone is really on the limiter and I think we plan to introduce a shutdown in the coming year Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff said on Saturday at last weekends Mexican Grand Prix. Advert  Become a RaceFans supporter and go adfree Not everyone is in agreement but I would very much hope that we can do that for our staff. Having this week couple of weeks more is definitely a nice welcome. But on the other side theres many people in the factory who are going to work flatout all through the Christmas and New Year. But for the race team thats clocking many air miles thats positive. Theres many of us team principals that would like to replicate what we have in the summer. At least starting at Christmas and then going into the new year for two weeks. But obviously thats still being up for discussion but there was a positive indication. For the wellbeing of the team. His counterpart at Alpine Otmar Szafnauer expects the plan will go ahead in 2023. This year it isnt happening so itll be next year he said. Christmas its one of those things that always happens on the same day every year. Its not like Thanksgiving. So I think its from the 23rd of December. So I think everyone gets Christmas Eve and Christmas day off. But that week through to the start of the year. Szafnauer also believes the change will be positive for the sport. The way I look at it is were doing more and more races. And if you dont force shutdowns people work through because its a strategic advantage. So if you remove that advantage meaning everyones got to take it off I think its good for all of us. As there is no winter shutdown at present restricting work Szafnauer says Alpines wind tunnel usually only shuts down two days for Christmas and New Years Day. We used to shut it down two days thats it. So if you dont force that shutdown you dont get any time off. Advert  Become a RaceFans supporter and go adfree 2022 F1 season
Gasly's near-ban shows absurdity of F1 penalty points system, https://the-race.com/formula-1/gaslys-near-ban-shows-absurdity-of-f1-penalty-points-system/, The everpresent desire for consistency means that theres a set tariff of penalty points for certain offences. He tipped Vettel into a spin earning a fivesecond penalty as well as two penalty points. This earned him a fivesecond penalty and two penalty points although Gasly questioned why he had been singled out for it. That could potentially create a troubling situation whereby the stewards are reluctant to issue penalty points. But his situation highlights that while the superlience penalty points system needs to exist its current form is flawed and needs reform., Formula 1s superlicence penalty points system is a good idea but poorlyimplemented as the absurd situation Pierre Gasly finds himself in  of being potentially one incident away from an automatic race ban  proves. Gasly has accrued 10 superlicence penalty points just two away from the 12point tally that automatically triggers a race ban. This will be hanging over him for the next nine races given the first of them wont be wiped until after next Mays Emilia Romagna Grand Prix. Whats more he only just evaded a ban for the upcoming Brazilian Grand Prix given the oneyear lifespan for penalty points meant he lost two earned for contact with Fernando Alonso at the first corner of last seasons Turkish Grand Prix shortly before his latest runin with the stewards. The AlphaTauri driver has committed six offences in 15 race weekends stretching back to Mays Spanish Grand Prix so you can argue he only has himself to blame. But while Gasly is overaggressive at times particularly when things arent going well and would be wellserved to rein it in at times hes hardly a danger on track. Adopted in 2014 the superlicence penalty points system was conceived to keep track of repeat offenders and create a mechanism whereby a race ban could be imposed on drivers who showed a troubling pattern of ontrack behaviour. This was a direct consequence of the crash at the start of the 2012 Belgian Grand Prix triggered by Romain Grosjean that took out among others Alonso. It was a logical move given it was felt that the number of incidents Grosjean had been involved with previously contributed to the decision to ban him for the Italian Grand Prix. There was a need for a formalised system that could set the bar for when to ban consistent troublemakers even if they didnt cause as significant an incident as the one Grosjean triggered. The stewards described the Spa crash as an extremely serious breach of the regulations which had the potential to cause injury to others and highlighted that it eliminated leading championship contenders from the race. Setting aside the troubling assertion that whether a driver you eliminate is a title contender or not is a factor in setting punishments something that thankfully has not been cited since in a stewards decision this highlighted the fact that generally a driver would only be banned for a single major incident rather than an accumulation. And that such an accumulation wasnt formally tallied up. There have been cases of bans in the past for such conduct. Famously Mika Hakkinen was banned from the 1994 Hungarian Grand Prix for causing a crash at the start of the preceding race in Germany. Eddie Irvine was given a onerace ban increased to three on appeal for the accident he triggered at Interlagos in 1994 that launched debutant Jos Verstappens Benetton into the air. In both cases there was a feeling that the drivers in question were at times too aggressive and that this contributed to the ban. Gasly driving in reckless manner exposed key F1 blindspot Read more A formalised penalty points system with 12 the threshold for an automatic ban is therefore an effective way to plot the conduct of drivers. Where F1 hasnt got it right is the way that this is implemented. The everpresent desire for consistency means that theres a set tariff of penalty points for certain offences. If you gain an advantage by exceeding track limits or are out of position at the start of the race its one point. For causing a collision or overtaking under the safety car its two points. But theres little or no wriggle room to revise the number of points upwards or downwards to better reflect the offence. Looking at Gaslys rap sheet its clear that while he is a repeat offender the idea that he could be banned for one more mishap in the next races seems ridiculous. Gaslys penalty points Spain  Causing a collision with Lance Stroll at Turn 1 2 points Aston Martin driver Stroll on soft tyres four laps younger than Gaslys mediums attempted to pass the AlphaTauri driver for 14th place on the 27th lap of the Spanish GP. As he had the use of DRS Gasly defended the inside line approaching Turn 1. Stroll was ahead at entry but as Gasly had the inside they were sidebyside at the apex. But as they exited the corner Gasly understeered into Stroll and pitched him into a spin. He was found wholly at fault for the collision although the collision was more due to a lack of grip and also hit with a fivesecond penalty. Austria  Colliding with Sebastian Vettel at Turn 4 2 points This was another case where Gasly was found wholly at fault after failing to give an Aston Martin  this time driven by Vettel  enough room when being passed around the outside. Vettel was just ahead entering the righthander so the move was on but in attempting to contest the corner Gasly braked a little late and understeered as a result. He tipped Vettel into a spin earning a fivesecond penalty as well as two penalty points. Austria  Leaving the track without reason multiple times 1 point Gasly had four laps deleted for exceeding track limits four times. That earned him a fivesecond penalty served at his second pitstop. Two of the offences were at Turn 10 one at Turn 9 and the fourth one at the first corner with stewards finding no justifiable reason for him doing so. Japan  Speeding under red flag conditions 2 points This is the most controversial of the offences and happened after he pitted at the end of lap one for a nose change having collected an advertising board spat onto the track by Carlos Sainzs accident. Gasly was deemed by the postSuzuka report into the controversy about a recovery tractor being on track in poor visibility to have driven in a reckless manner by not respecting yellow flags. Thats despite being well within the safety car delta which hadnt reset after hed visited the pits. But his penalty was for speeding once the red flags were shown about one second before he passed the tractor. He was found to have exceeded 200kmh 124mph on multiple occasionsand reached 251kmh 156mph at one point. US  Falling more than 10 car lengths behind safety car 2 points Gasly was found to have been significantly more than 10 car lengths behind the car in front under the safety car at Austin. This earned him a fivesecond penalty and two penalty points although Gasly questioned why he had been singled out for it. You arrive at 200kmh 124mph hit the brake down to 60kmh 37mph and at the same time the guy in front of you is hitting the throttle flat out and pulls the gap straight away of 150200 metres said Gasly. On the internet a lot of people are quite curious and managed to find a lot of reviews cases of drivers who did the same under the safety car without penalty. Mexico  Leaving the track and gaining an advantage 1 point Gasly passed Stroll for 15th place on the 13th lap of the Mexican GP at Turn 4. He had the inside line into the corner but locked up on the way in and forced Stroll wide. Stroll took to the runoff while Gasly also exceeded track limits. That meant he was given a penalty for leaving the track and gaining an advantage rather than forcing another driver off track. Had he been found to have committed the latter offence which would have been perfectly legitimate he would have gained an extra penalty point. This list of offences highlights several problems. Firstly speeding under the red flag certainly in the way Gasly did it should be worth more penalty points given the safety implications. That is exactly the kind of dangerous driving that the FIA needs to make completely unacceptable. But the rest of the offences are hardly ones indicative of a dangerous driver. Those at Aston Martin might disagree given three of the incidents involve green cars as the victims but they were honest mistakes in battle rather than egregious examples of incompetent or dirty driving. Gasly should take a close look at the way he handles himself in battle to cut back on such incidents and that will benefit both himself and those around him. Whats more he should avoid getting too deep into the mindset that hes being persecuted by the stewards even if his penalty for dropping too far behind the car ahead under the safety car at Austin was incredibly harsh. But he hardly needs the reality check either of a onerace ban or the threat of it. Its not impossible Gasly will get through the next nine events without picking up another two penalty points and that will certainly be his aim. If he does so you could argue the system works as the Sword of Damocles hanging over him might have forced him to modify his ontrack behaviour. But theres a good chance he will commit another offence. That could potentially create a troubling situation whereby the stewards are reluctant to issue penalty points. And as theres little room in the way this is done that might even impact the offences he gets penalised for. That doesnt mean hell not be penalised but it was notable that he was hit with an offence that came with just one penalty point for the Turn 4 incident with Stroll in Mexico rather than being done for forcing him off track which comes with two points. Brown calls for F1 stewards to be fulltime  Why arent they Read more This is connected to the wider question of F1 stewarding. The case for permanent stewards is a strong one and would make it easier for increased flexibility within the penalty points issued to differentiate between what you might call runofthemill incidents and minor errors and those that are more problematic and that collectively indicate a problematic pattern of behaviour. Its all well and good to have guidelines but creating a set menu of points for certain offences has turned what is meant to be a system to tackle those rare cases of those who cannot or will not handle themselves safely on track into an inflexible blunt instrument. If Gaslys rap sheet was more problematic there would be no such concerns. But his situation highlights that while the superlience penalty points system needs to exist its current form is flawed and needs reform.

For me its about whats best for the Haas team in the medium to long term. Steiner also reportedly told the German outlet that it was between only Schumacher and Nico Hulkenberg. Hulkenberg 35 is a wellknown name in F1 and a wellrespected driver with 181 race starts to his name. So if it is Mick it is Mick and if its somebody else its somebody else., Formula 1s battle for final 2023 seat Haas set to choose between Mick Schumacher and Nico Hulkenberg Mick Schumacher and Nico Hulkenberg are battling it out for a 2023 F1 seat with Haas The battle for the final Formula 1 seat on the 2023 grid appears to be a straight fight between Mick Schumacher and Nico Hulkenberg with Haas hoping to make a decision before the end of the season. All nine other teams  providing Logan Sargeant gets enough super license points to join Williams  have finalised their driver lineups for next year and so all eyes are on Haas with Schumacher no longer the certainty he once seemed to seal another chance alongside Kevin Magnussen. Schumacher the son of F1 legend Michael has been steady but not spectacular since making his muchanticipated debut in F1 in 2021 and has also attracted criticism from his team for his numerous crashes. One of the major pulls for the German meanwhile was that he was a Ferrari junior but the 23yearold is losing his ties to Ferrari Haas engine providers and major partners at the end of this year. Schumacher is still regarded as the favourite for the seat but with Magnussen both outscoring and outqualifying him Haas boss Guenther Steiner recently admitted it was 5050 whether he would remain with the team or not.

For me its about whats best for the Haas team in the medium to long term. Its about who leads the team stably into the future. Steiner also reportedly told the German outlet that it was between only Schumacher and Nico Hulkenberg. Hulkenberg 35 is a wellknown name in F1 and a wellrespected driver with 181 race starts to his name. He was generally seen as unlucky to lose his Renault seat back in 2020 and since then has stuck around in F1 as a reserve driver for Racing Point and then Aston Martin deputising in five races over the last three years.

Steiner while looking for the medium to long term has also made it clear he wants his next driver to be a leader. Mick has got some experience obviously its his second year in Formula 1 he said. But is that enough to take the team forward We need leadership from this position. And these are all the things I evaluate thats the most important thing.

Options narrow for Ricciardo's Formula 1 future, https://www.speedcafe.com/2022/11/03/options-narrow-for-ricciardos-formula-1-future/, There look to be just two potential berths if Daniel Ricciardo is to remain in Formula 1 in 2023. Reserve Drivers perform a variety of functions for teams differing slightly for each but fundamentally offering the same services. Options for Ricciardo as a Reserve Driver are therefore limited. As you know as well we also have an agreement with other teams to share Reserve Drivers. Such a move would also be consistent with Ricciardos own statements where he asserted his future was not contingent on anyone else., There look to be just two potential berths if Daniel Ricciardo is to remain in Formula 1 in 2023. The Australian will not be in a race drive next year but is known to be interested in a Reserve Driver role should a suitable option be available. Following confirmation of Stoffel Vandoorne at Aston Martin earlier this week those potential employers have been further reduced. Reserve Drivers perform a variety of functions for teams differing slightly for each but fundamentally offering the same services. Most visible is their role in the garage listening in to the radio during sessions and taking part in debriefs thereafter. They are at the circuit as a potential shortnotice replacement and are often given time in the car during testing to bring them up to speed with the systems and fundamentals of the machine. This will often see them at events on a Friday before travelling back to base that afternoon ahead of a long night at the factory. There they work in the simulator to refine and develop car setup over a race weekend. The biggest teams will employ multiple simulator drivers with their focus on evaluating different setup options and recommending changes ahead of Saturdays Free Practice 3. Beyond that the Reserve Driver interacts with guests and is an ambassador for the team at public events speaking to the Paddock Club and so on. Typically there are two different types of drivers employed in those roles high potential youngsters who are being groomed for a possible race drive in future or race drivers whose active careers have come to an end. There are exceptions but by and large the bulk of drivers Vandoorne included fall into one of those buckets. Indeed Aston Martin is a perfect microcosm of that the team also employs Formula 2 championelect Felipe Drugovich. Vandoorne had been in a Reserve Driver role at Mercedes since 2020 coupling that with his drive for the threepointed star in Formula E. His exit along with that of Nyck de Vries who will join Scuderia AlphaTauri as race driver for 2023 leaves the AngloGerman operation without a nominated Reserve Driver for 2023. It is one of just three drivers in that position the others being McLaren and Alpine. Options for Ricciardo as a Reserve Driver are therefore limited. Sources have confirmed to Speedcafe.com that he is in discussions with a top team for an opportunity from which we can safely eliminate much of the field. We can further eliminate teams based on their stated positions with McLaren and Alpine having voiced those. Andreas Seidl Team Principal at McLaren has admitted that his team would be open to the concept but no conversations have been had on the notion. Thats a discussion we didnt have yet he said when asked of the possibility by Speedcafe.com. Its a discussion we usually have in winter. As you know as well we also have an agreement with other teams to share Reserve Drivers. Again theres absolutely no hard or bad feelings between Daniel and us and therefore in general I think its possible. At Alpine Otmar Szafnauer all but ruled out the Australians return to Enstone in a Reserve Driver capacity. We havent made that decision yet Szafnauer said of who will step into the role currently officially held by Piastri. But to be fair to Daniel we havent been talking to him about a reserve role. Given that we can logically whittle the list of potential employers to three Mercedes Red Bull and Ferrari. The latter has traditionally favoured its internal programme. It has Robert Shwartzman within its ranks already as well as the experienced Antonio Giovinazzi. In that scenario what does Ricciardo offer that the team does not already have A berth at Ferrari is therefore unlikely. Red Bull on the other hand is a possibility. It has Formula 2 race winner Liam Lawson as its nextinline youngster but when the opportunity presented to move him into a race drive Red Bull instead opted to go outside of its junior programme to recruit Nyck de Vries. Its not a huge vote of confidence in the young New Zealander who has just a handful of test outings in a Formula 1 car to his name. The squad also has Sebastien Buemi though the World Endurance Champions Formula 1 experience is somewhat dated. There is then something of a hole in the squads structure especially when one considers it has four drivers to protect Max Verstappen Sergio Perez Yuki Tsunoda and for 2023 de Vries. It would therefore make sense to bring in an experienced driver at a currently very affordable rate to mitigate that risk while also adding contemporary knowledge to the simulator programme. Of course its need is lower than Mercedes given it at least has Lawson on hand should he be needed. Given Vandoorne and de Vries have both moved on the Brackleybased operation has nobody to back up Lewis Hamilton and George Russell. It has the greatest need of a driver and of those on the market Ricciardo has the best credentials by some considerable distance. Such a move would also be consistent with Ricciardos own statements where he asserted his future was not contingent on anyone else. My future will be lets say I dont think its relative to what others do he said last month when Speedcafe.com asked about his future and Hamiltons intention to carry on beyond 2023. Opportunities will arise when they do but Im not banking on anyone doing something so I can find my way. I want to take the time necessary keep a little bit of distance to the sport and rebuild myself. But then yeah if something makes make sense in 24 come back with a vengeance and have some fun and hopefully race at the front.

Jenson Button warns Daniel Ricciardo he could be ruining his Formula One career with huge mistake, https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/formulaone/article-11383315/Jenson-Button-warns-Daniel-Ricciardo-ruining-Formula-One-career-huge-mistake.html, Former F1 world champion Jenson Button has warned Daniel Ricciardo his plan to become a reserve driver in 2023 instead of taking a seat with a backfield team could do irreparable damage to his career. Ricciardo has been linked to a reserve position with Mercedes and Red Bull next season  a move Button believes would make it extremely difficult for him to return to drive for a top team again. But I still think it would have been a better move for him  go into a team work hard show people what you can do in a car that maybe suits you a bit more and then people forget what happened the year before. Its a tricky one and I really struggle to see him coming back to a competitive team after having a year out. And with the calendar being so long it was hard to remove yourself from what was happening in the racing., Former F1 world champion Jenson Button has warned Daniel Ricciardo his plan to become a reserve driver in 2023 instead of taking a seat with a backfield team could do irreparable damage to his career. The Australian has been dropped by McLaren after failing to find form with the famous English outfit and recently exclusively revealed to Daily Mail that he wants a little distance from the sport so he can rebuild himself after two years of shocking results. Ricciardo has been linked to a reserve position with Mercedes and Red Bull next season  a move Button believes would make it extremely difficult for him to return to drive for a top team again. The struggling Aussie star has confessed he wants to put some space between himself and the sport next year as hes been connected to a reserve role with Mercedes or Red Bull Exworld champ Jenson Button pictured with wife Brittny believes stepping back from the starting grid will make it very hard for Ricciardo to return to driving for a top team I guess he didnt want to drop too far down the grid and work with a team thats more towards the rear because its difficult for a driver coming from a team that is almost wining races at times to suddenly know youre fighting for points Button said on Sky Sports. It is tough. But I still think it would have been a better move for him  go into a team work hard show people what you can do in a car that maybe suits you a bit more and then people forget what happened the year before. But sitting out People just remember what happened last year. Its a tricky one and I really struggle to see him coming back to a competitive team after having a year out. Ricciardos desire to put some distance between himself and the sport stems from how badly hes been affected by his struggles this season and last. Despite a thrilling run to seventh in the Mexico Grand Prix that earned him Driver of the Day honours Ricciardo sits a lowly 12th in this years drivers standings with just 29 points to his name  far behind teammate Lando Norris whos coming seventh with 109. Ricciardo pictured at the Mexico Grand Prix had to speak to a psychologist last year as his shocking run of form at McLaren took its toll My confidence was being eaten away driving a car that wouldnt dance with me and would bite back Ricciardo told Daily Mail. Whenever we thought we would found a solution along would come another set of challenges. When you put so much into something and it doesnt work out there is sadness. It gets to you. Last year it affected me a little bit too much. I wouldnt be my usual bubbly self. I would be reluctant if someone said lets go out for dinner. I would need some cajoling. I let it get to me. I started to speak to a psychologist last year  the most challenging year I have had. Racing is very much results driven and dictates your Sunday happiness. I was neglecting friendships and thought it would be good to talk to someone to make sure the two sides of my life didnt cross over. Its like all things you need perspective. And with the calendar being so long it was hard to remove yourself from what was happening in the racing.
Piero Ferrari and Binotto lead tributes to legendary F1 engineer Forghieri, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/piero-ferrari-and-binotto-lead-tributes-to-legendary-f1-engineer-forghieri/10394299/, On the teams website Piero Ferrari recalled mediating between his father and Forghieri. While Mauro Forghieri taken on a few years earlier was next door. We mourn the passing of Mauro Forghieri one of the most amazing people to have worked here. Current head of GT sporting activities Antonello Coletta said Mauro Forghieri played a key role in fuelling the history of Ferrari. Enzo Ferrari claimed to be an agitator of men and I think we can say that Forghieri was an agitator of ideas., Forghieri is widely regarded as one of the key players in the history of Scuderia Ferrari having been a team manager and both a chassis and engine designer with the Maranello outfit. His stint with the company lasted from 1959 to 1987 encompassing some of its most memorable successes. He is credited with an involvement in 54 race wins and 11 world championships. On the teams website Piero Ferrari recalled mediating between his father and Forghieri. When I joined the company in 1965 I shared an office with Cavalier Giberti Ferraris first employee he said. While Mauro Forghieri taken on a few years earlier was next door. We were therefore separated by 10 years of age and a window. In fact we saw each other all day every day. Forghieri was energetic and passionate about everything he did. He was sanguine and I recall that in many of those interminable meetings at the Gestione Sportiva that started in the evening and went on into the night I mediated between him and my father. I know my father appreciated his tireless work ethic and he knew that any mistakes only came about through an attempt to do something better and to look ahead. We have lost a part of our history a man who gave a great deal to Ferrari and to the world of racing in general. Chris Amon Ferrari 312 Mauro Forghieri chief engineer Ferrari founder and owner Enzo Ferrari Photo by Motorsport Images Binotto noted that Forghieri was a great motivator with a charismatic personality. Today is a very sad day for everyone at Scuderia Ferrari he said. We mourn the passing of Mauro Forghieri one of the most amazing people to have worked here. He was appointed as team manager at the age of 27 and with his brilliant insights he was one of the last allround engineers in the car world. I met him on various occasions and each time was something special. He was to the end a truly charismatic individual. His revolutionary ideas together with his vibrant nature his abilities as a great motivator meant he played a very important role in some of the most significant moments of Ferraris history and he did more than most to fuel the Prancing Horse legend. We will all miss him. Forghieri was also very much involved in Ferraris sportscar racing programme which was shelved in the early 1970s. Current head of GT sporting activities Antonello Coletta said Mauro Forghieri played a key role in fuelling the history of Ferrari. Enzo Ferrari claimed to be an agitator of men and I think we can say that Forghieri was an agitator of ideas. He was a brilliant innovator capable of coming up with technical solutions that eluded most of the engineers of his day. He was a designer who went beyond his defined role who became a benchmark and a source of inspiration for everyone who worked with him. He was an eclectic designer and his curiosity and desire to push the boundaries sealed his place in the history of Ferrari and motorsport in general.
OBITUARY: Mauro Forghieri technical genius behind some of Formula 1’s greatest Ferraris remembered, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.obituary-mauro-forghieri-technical-genius-behind-some-of-formula-1s-greatest.67IR5vwYq73vG9mhaKYd3N.html, Mauro Forghieri who has died at 87 found himself thrust into the F1 limelight in 1962 at the tender age of 26. He later worked directly for Alfa and Mauro went to school in Milan. He himself had gatecrashed some Ferrari lunches where driver Clemente Biondetti a fourtime Mille Miglia winner had become his hero. His was thus an allround education in the racing world learning at the feet of the spirited technical director Carlo Chiti. There was excitement when Ayrton Senna tested the engine for McLaren and was impressed with it as a potential replacement for the Honda V12 engine they were due to lose for 1993., Mauro Forghieri who has died at 87 found himself thrust into the F1 limelight in 1962 at the tender age of 26. His grandfather Anselmo was a passionate and committed socialist who was a friend of Mussolini and Sandro Pertini the socialist politician who went on to become the president of Italy from 1978 to 1985. His father Reclus trained at the Fermo Corni Technical Industrial Institute and worked with Enzo Ferrari in 1937 and 38 in Milan during the conception of the Alfa Romeo 158 which went on to claim the first two official Drivers World Championships in 1950 and 51. He later worked directly for Alfa and Mauro went to school in Milan. Separated by the war the Forghieri family was reunited when hostilities ceased and after working for a while on classic cars while living between Nice and Monaco on the French Riviera Reclus returned to Modena and went to work as a toolmaker at Ferrari where he remained until 1973. READ MORE Under the bodywork of the Ferrari 312B3 Mauro who shared his grandfathers and fathers penchant for passionate selfexpression was raised there then educated at Bologna University where he graduated in 1959 with a doctorate in mechanical engineering. He revealed that his father had been only slightly interested in racing as the Mille Miglia had actually passed by their front door. He himself had gatecrashed some Ferrari lunches where driver Clemente Biondetti a fourtime Mille Miglia winner had become his hero. He had done an internship at Ferrari in 1957 but his knowledge of Formula 1 was minimal and after an initial leaning towards teaching he then considered emigrating to California to work for a company making aircraft turbine engines. But Enzo Ferrari himself was insistent that he should follow his father into the company. Soon he became involved in myriad engineering projects learning not just about engines but gearboxes chassis and suspension. His was thus an allround education in the racing world learning at the feet of the spirited technical director Carlo Chiti. Forghieri back to camera stayed with Ferrari after an exodus of personnel including Carlo Chiti L  who designed the Sharknose cars The big break came on October 30 1961. At that time Ferrari had won the World Championship with Phil Hill and the Sharknose 156. In a reverse palace coup Chiti and team manager Romolo Tavoni and most of the design staff had quit. Tired of Laura Ferrari Enzos wifes endless meddling they had formed Automobili Turismo e Sport ATS in Sasso Marconi in Bologna with financial backing from industrialists Jaime Ortiz Patino Giorgio Billi and Count Giovanni Volpi. Hill went with them and when the venture failed his career was left in ruins. It was a Monday Forghieri recalled. My life was turned around completely. Ferrari called me and got straight to the point. He said From this moment on you are responsible for all the motor sport activity and testing. I was amazed agog but I was able to maintain a certain lucidity he admitted. But as he pointed out immediately to Il Commendatore he was only 26 and had zero experience. READ MORE Legendary Ferrari engineer Mauro Forghieri passes away aged 87 Moreover while Ferrari had gained the jump on the dominant British teams Lotus Cooper and BRM when they refused initially to accept that the new 1.5litre formula really would happen in 1961 by 1962 with new V8 engines and in Lotuss case the groundbreaking bathtub monocoque chassis they had caught up and exposed Ferraris inherent weaknesses. His was thus a Herculean task but by 1963 he had persuaded Ferrari to employ John Surtees whose talent together with Chris Amons in later years he believed to be the equal of Jim Clarks. By 1964 Surtees had taken Ferrari to the Drivers and Constructors World Championships and though the subsequent series of 312 cars were necessarily born around an elderly 3litre V12 sportcar engine from 1966 and only won three races between that year and 1969 the flat12 engine he commissioned Franco Rocchi Franco to create for 1970 led to a rebirth when installed in his own 312B chassis. Forghieri with the Daytonawinning 330 P4 one of the revered P series of Scuderia sports cars Jacky Ickx narrowly lost out on the title that year but by 1974 Ferrari was back on track with Niki Lauda and Clay Regazzoni winning races. Lauda went on to win Drivers titles in 1975 and 77 after missing out narrowly to James Hunt in 1976 and Ferrari won the Constructors titles in all three years. He designed the transversal transmission that helped to create the cars excellent weight distribution from 1975 onwards. Jody Scheckter aided by Gilles Villeneuve added two more titles in 1979 and the turbocharged 126 cars of 1982 and 83 likewise won Constructors laurels as British designer Harvey Postlethwaite was engaged to work alongside Forghieri. Polemics were always a crucial part of Ferrari given the passionate support of the tifosi and the aggression of an Italian media that was intolerant of anything other than success. Ferrari scored but a single victory in 1984 and by 1985 the politics within the team obliged Ferrari to move Mauro sideways as face was saved by appointing him director of Ferraris advanced research office and Harvey was left in sole charge of F1 engineering. Mauro endured this new regime working from January 1985 on the 408 4RM concept car until it was completed in May 1987 whereupon he finally left the Scuderia to take on the role of technical director of the newly formed Lamborghini Engineering. Lamborghini had been bought by Chryslers Lee Iacocca that year and he wanted an F1 engine to help sell its roadgoing supercars. Company boss Daniele Audetto had worked with Forghieri while he was team manager at Ferrari and they worked well together as Mauro designed a normallyaspirated V12 engine for the new 3.5litre formula which came into force for 1989. It would power a Lola entered by Gerard Larrousses team. The engine was shown to the media in April 1988 and ran for the first time at Dijon in December in a Larrousse Lola driven by Philippe Alliot. It showed potential though the best result was just a sixth for Alliot in the Spanish GP. The engine was used by Larrousse and Lola for 1990 the best results being a thirdplaced podium for Aguri Suzuki for the former in Japan plus sixths in Britain and Spain and fifth in Hungary and sixth in Canada for Derek Warwick for the latter. Forghieri who designed the innovative 312 T series with Lauda L Agreement was reached for Lamborghini Engineering to design a bespoke car powered by the V12 engine for Mexican businessman Fernando Gonzalez Lunas new team for 1991. Forghieri oversaw the project as Mario Tolentino drew the Glas 001 but when Luna disappeared in June 1990 and the nascent team succumbed Audetto convinced Italian financier Carlo Patrucco to take over the project and Mauro was appointed technical director of the new Modena Teams Lambo 291. The arrangement proved shortlived and he was back at Lamborghini Engineering developing the V12 further until he was replaced by Mike Rice after a shakeup. There was excitement when Ayrton Senna tested the engine for McLaren and was impressed with it as a potential replacement for the Honda V12 engine they were due to lose for 1993. In the end however that deal came to nothing. Mauro designed an electric minivan for Enel in 1992 and was appointed technical director of Bugatti Automobili where he developed the EB110 and 112 models before leaving to found Oral Engineering in Modena with Franco Antoniazzi and Sergio Lugli early in 1995. His work there embraced the design research and development of automobile motorcycle marine and gokart engines for clients such as BMW Bugatti and Aprilia and turning the Ferrari Pinin concept car into a pukka roadworthy vehicle. Later he was chief engineer in the mid2000s on the Project 1221 MF1 sports car. He was also one of the technical experts called to court during the official investigation into the death of Ayrton Senna at Imola on May 1 that year. Forghieri oversaw the creation of the Bugatti EB110

Doohan took part in first practice at the Mexico City Grand Prix as the most senior member of Alpines junior driver academy standing in for Esteban Ocon. It was the culmination of his junior program with the team that has so far featured three private tests in last years car as well as 100 kilometres in the current Alpine for a filming day. Watch every practice qualifying and race of the 2022 FIA Formula One World Championship live on Kayo. New to Kayo Start your free trial now  The 19yearold has impressed in his standout rookie Formula 2 campaign this season sitting fourth in the championship with three wins including in the feature race at SpaFrancorchamps. He could finish in the top three depending on results at the final round of the year. He was briefly considered for a sudden elevation to Formula 1 for next season when both Fernando Alonso and Oscar Piastri defected from the team during the midseason break but Alpine instead signed Pierre Gasly giving Doohan a second campaign in Formula 2 to hone his craft. Another practice session is also on his horizon at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix as part of the teams efforts to better embed him into its grand prix operation and Doohan said it was part of the plan to ready him for his eventual F1 debut. Im just trying to prepare myself as much as possible and kind of maximise what I can do  learn as much from the team and try and really embed myself with the team so if the opportunity does arise to get in the car or become a fulltime driver Im more than ready he told select media including Fox Sports. Thats what Alpine are helping me to do and really thats the plan. Im part of their future which Im a very thankful for. This is the plan to obviously win Formula 2 next year as well as be in the best possible position to see what the future holds. NASCAR driver uses wall to advantage  0126 Its a role similar to that held by Piastri before he split with the team. That process remains ongoing with McLaren so far signalling that it doesnt expect to get access to the Australian until next year. But despite Piastri being shuffled towards the exit Doohan said he hadnt yet been given his compatriots reservedriver status for this season or next. I havent had any clarification on that he said. An Alpine spokesperson added that an announcement on reserve drivers would be made in due course. Regardless of the formalities theres no doubt Doohans path to Formula 1 has opened dramatically in the last 12 months. His decision at the end of last year to switch to the Alpine program from Red Bulls junior academy  which is much celebrated but held at arms length from Red Bull Racing  has paid dividends in terms of his connectedness to a Formula 1 team and the active development hes receiving. Its also put him in a prime position to capitalise from the turmoil in Alpines driver roster elevating him to the top of the junior program just as the best of his Formula 2 results started to flow. Verstappen claims another win Ric 7th  0235 Asked whether he could see his route into Formula 1 Doohan said he was confident. For sure I see that he said. The possibility is there. I just need to obviously keep on working doing the best that I possibly can and keep working with Alpine because theyve been honestly amazing to me. Im really proud to be part of the team and I hope to be a part of their future and in the long plan because from just working with the team in the past two events and my short periods while in F2 we have amazing potential here. Good things are 100 per cent coming so to be part of it in the future should be really cool. Theyve helped me so much from joining the academy in January to doing my first FP1 session now in October so theyre looking after me really well. I cant wait to repay the favour hopefully in years to come.

Ive watched the event on TV for many years and I came so close to competing last year until I had to pull out at the last minute. It was tough watching everyone having so much fun throwing their cars around on the snow and ice in Sweden so Im glad I will now be joining them at Pite Havsbad in January. The Finnish driver was set to make his debut in the 2022 iteration of the Race Of Champions but pulled out days before the competition. This season he has again planned to compete alongside compatriot and twotime F1 champion Mika Hakkinen in the ROC Nations Cup on January 28 and the individual Race Of Champions on January 29. Im also thrilled to be able to partner Mika Hakkinen for Team Finland in the ROC Nations Cup. I have become good friends with Mika over the years but it will be a special treat to be able to race alongside him. Weve both taken part in the Arctic Rally a few times so hopefully that can help us beat our Nordic neighbours  and everyone else. Then well have to put our friendship aside again and try to beat each other in the individual Race Of Champions. Whatever happens Im sure we will put on a great show for all the fans watching at the track and around the world.

Will Red Bull's punishment deter future F1 cost cap breaches?, https://www.crash.net/f1/feature/1016171/1/will-red-bull-s-punishment-deter-future-f1-cost-cap-breaches, Red Bull have been fined 7m and docked 10 percent of their aerodynamic testing time for the next 12 months after their submitted accounts were found to be 1.6 percent over the 145m spending limit set during Max Verstappens titlewinning 2021 campaign. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner described a 10 percent aero research reduction for an 0.37 overspend as draconian but said his team begrudgingly accepted the sanction for the good of the sport. Asked whether the punishment was strong enough to prevent Mercedes from purposely committing a breach in future Toto Wolff argued the reputational damage Red Bull sustained was a big enough deterrent. Mike Krack whose Aston Martin team were fined 450000 after striking their own ABA for procedural infringements of the cost cap insists the FIA must be trusted to govern fairly and properly. This is for the FIA to judge Krack said when asked if he thinks the penalty strengthens the budget cap., Red Bull have been fined 7m and docked 10 percent of their aerodynamic testing time for the next 12 months after their submitted accounts were found to be 1.6 percent over the 145m spending limit set during Max Verstappens titlewinning 2021 campaign. The FIA ruled there were 13 areas where Red Bull had wrongly excluded costs which amounted to an overspend of 1.8m however F1s governing body acknowledged the team would have exceeded the cap by only 432652 had they not omitted a tax credit in their submission. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner described a 10 percent aero research reduction for an 0.37 overspend as draconian but said his team begrudgingly accepted the sanction for the good of the sport. With rivals including Ferrari and McLaren publicly expressing their displeasure at the size of the penalty questions were raised as to whether the FIAs verdict would draw a line under the case or open up a new can of worms. Asked whether the punishment was strong enough to prevent Mercedes from purposely committing a breach in future Toto Wolff argued the reputational damage Red Bull sustained was a big enough deterrent. I think what you see is that beyond the sporting penalty and the financial fine theres also a reputational damage and in a world of transparency and good governance thats just not on anymore Wolff told Sky Sports. And compliancewise in whatever team you are youre responsible for representing a brand your employees your partners and thats why for us it wouldnt be a business case. For Ferrari question marks still remain. Ferrari racing director Laurent Mekies was sceptical about Horners claims and the overall impact of the penalty suggesting Red Bulls Accepted Breach Agreement with the FIA simply encourages money that could have been detracted from their budget to be spent elsewhere. We at Ferrari do not understand how the 10 reduction of the ATA can correspond to the same amount of lap time Mekies told Sky Sports Italia. Furthermore there is another problem in that since there is no budget cap reduction in the penalty the basic effect is to push the competitor to spend the money elsewhere. It has total freedom to use the money it can no longer spend on use of the wind tunnel and CFD due to the 10 reduction on reducing the weight of the car or who knows what else. Our concern is that the combination of these two factors means the real effect of the penalty is very limited. Time to close the chapter Other teams believe it is the end of the matter  for now at least. Mike Krack whose Aston Martin team were fined 450000 after striking their own ABA for procedural infringements of the cost cap insists the FIA must be trusted to govern fairly and properly. This is for the FIA to judge Krack said when asked if he thinks the penalty strengthens the budget cap. I think there has been enough polemics around the whole topic about how big the fine has to be. I think we should now look to the front and not back and discuss who had which fine and if it was large enough or not. The FIA is in charge of doing that. We have to trust that they do that correctly and respect that. Despite dismissing Red Bulls claim that their penalty could cost them up to half a second in laptime next season Alfa Romeo team principal Fred Vasseur echoed Wolffs view that brand damage alone would stop teams from making the same mistake. The biggest punishment for a team is to accept that they were overspending in terms of image and we dont have to underestimate this one  for your employees for your sponsors and so on Vasseur explained. I think its very good to reach the end of the discussion to have a clear picture of the FIA to have a clear decision from the FIA to have an agreement from the team also this will help to close the chapter. Then if you speak about technical or sporting decisions or penalties its a bit different for me because Im not sure we are making half a second with 10 per cent of your allocation or we are very stupid. Horner highlighted the matter could have dragged on for months had Red Bull challenged the FIA and decided to take things as far as the FIAs International Court of Appeal. Concerns have also been raised about how long the auditing process took as well as the prospect for F1 to be facing a case of deja vu when the results of teams spending for 2022 are revealed. To avoid another potential cost cap saga this time next year teams have urged F1 and the FIA to find a way of speeding up the process to ensure there is no controversy hanging over the outcome of the previous seasons championship. I think we should close this chapter now for 2021 but the FIA has to control the teams from the very beginning onwards from January onwards which is what I said already two years ago when we discussed this cost cap story said AlphaTauri team principal Franz Tost. Why Because the regulation is very very complicated and there is room for different interpretations and therefore the teams need some support and the FIA has to send people to the teams to check all this because its bad for the image of Formula 1 for the teams whatever if one year afterwards we discuss about overspending or whatever. This has to be done and sorted out during the season that at the end of the season everything is finalised and the technical regulations are also possible why shouldnt it be possible in the financial regulations. We have a meeting every Tuesday. I know every Tuesday how much we are below the cost cap and how we have to react and I think this should be the F1 standard that at the end of the season we know who won the championship and that this team was below the cost cap and everything has been sorted out.
F1 set to abandon plan to lower tyre blanket temperatures for 2023, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/f1-set-to-abandon-plan-to-lower-tyre-blanket-temperatures-for-2023/10393961/, Listen to this articleThe move has long been planned as part of an additional change for 2024 where tyre blanket use is set to be totally abandoned within the championships sustainability drive. Because this is the period of blanket that is using a lot more energy  its like the oven at home he continued. And to propose a full 2023 strategy of tyre blanket heating two hours at 70C. Thats the plan for the moment.It is understood that Pirelli has also presented its 2023 tyre blanket idea to the FIA and the F1 organisation and has received positive feedback to the new approach rather than lowering the blanket temperature to 50C. Isola also suggested that the inevent tyre testing conducted in Austin and Mexico could return at certain events next year., Listen to this article The move has long been planned as part of an additional change for 2024 where tyre blanket use is set to be totally abandoned within the championships sustainability drive. But lowering tyre blanket temperature alone has proved to be unpopular with the drivers and has been in the headlines in particular since the recent US Grand Prix where the first of two inevent 2023 tyre tests took place before the second occurred in Mexico last weekend. Red Bulls world champion Max Verstappen said the move would lead to a lot of crashes while McLarens Lando Norris felt everyones going to shunt their car at some point. In response to the drivers comments after the Austin test Pirelli conducted an experiment for the Mexico test where the tyres were heated in blankets at 70C but only for two hours and not the usual three which would have remained the operation for the 50C limit being brought in. Pirelli apparently discovered that this change actually used less energy overall and would soothe the drivers concerns at the same time. Pirelli motorsport boss Mario Isola then explained to Motorsport.com that while for 2024 the plan is still not to have a blanket for next year the investigation of our analysis said that if you warm the tyres at 70C for two hours and not three hours you save more energy than the blankets at 50C for three hours. Because this is the period of blanket that is using a lot more energy  its like the oven at home he continued. So if you switch it on you have a first phase where you go up to the required temperature and then its stabilised. But to keep the temperature at the level you want you need to use energy. So thats the point. Tyre heating system Ferrari F175 Charles Leclerc Carlos Sainz Photo by Erik Junius Isola presented Pirellis findings to the drivers in their Mexico City GP postFP2 regular briefing. He said that the drivers agreed they would prefer F1 to adopt the approach of heating the tyres hotter for a shorter period. For me its a sensible solution said Isola. As I said we also save more energy. Now we have to analyse all the data from the heating approach ahead of the Mexico test because clearly the test was only last Friday and we didnt have a lot of time to analyse the data. The rest of the plan is to find the five compounds we want to homologate for 2023. Then bring the final version of the tyres to Abu Dhabi for the postseason test so the drivers can test the final range of compounds. And to propose a full 2023 strategy of tyre blanket heating two hours at 70C. Thats the plan for the moment. It is understood that Pirelli has also presented its 2023 tyre blanket idea to the FIA and the F1 organisation and has received positive feedback to the new approach rather than lowering the blanket temperature to 50C. Isola also suggested that the inevent tyre testing conducted in Austin and Mexico could return at certain events next year. These are useful only for Pirelli getting data on how the compounds it is producing are working rather than building the specific construction of the tyres  that requires longer private test events as cars need their setups adjusted to get the right data. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes W13 Photo by Andy Hone  Motorsport Images What they call in competition test is an option for the future said Isola. Especially next year we have 24 races we have a second part of the season with a lot of overseas events. We know how much teams and team personnel are stressed because they have to travel a lot and so on. So if we have this option we dont oblige the teams to stay out for another 23 days for our tyre testing. And we can use this in a second part of the season. As the 2024 tyre blanket ban plan is remaining at this stage it would be logical to expect that either Pirelli would have to produce all new tyre constructions for that year or the teams would have to make substantial changes to their designs to improve earlystint tyre warm up. There were suggestions from some engineers that on this factor too the impact of the proposed reduction to 50C tyre blanket heating had only been fully revealed very late in the car design process for 2023 which also added to the opposition to that plan being utilised.
Ferrari's rivals don't think Mexico slump was true reflection of F1 form, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/ferraris-rival-dont-think-mexico-slump-was-true-reflection-of-f1-form/10394009/, However few believe that the Mexico showing was realistic of where Ferrari stacks up right now. Asked if Red Bull regarded Mercedes as its strongest competitor in F1 team boss Christian Horner said I think this track has played to their strengths. I think Ferrari looked like they were a little bit handicapped this weekend so Im not sure we saw their real pace. Im pretty sure if Im listening at the drivers later on in the debriefing they will tell me that the car was not turning. The reason why I think it has to be looked at and we have not a clear explanation right now.Additional reporting by Filip Cleeren, Ferrari endured one of its most challenging outings of the season in Mexico last weekend as it could not extract its regular pace from the F175. That left the door open for Mercedes to emerge as Red Bulls main challenger for victory. In the end Carlos Sainz was the lead Ferrari to come home in fifth place but he finished more than 58 seconds behind winner Max Verstappen. With Mercedes having enjoyed a recent uplift in form Ferraris performances have prompted suggestions that Red Bulls main threat is now the German manufacturer rather than the Italian squad. However few believe that the Mexico showing was realistic of where Ferrari stacks up right now. Asked if Red Bull regarded Mercedes as its strongest competitor in F1 team boss Christian Horner said I think this track has played to their strengths. I think Ferrari looked like they were a little bit handicapped this weekend so Im not sure we saw their real pace. Im sure theyll be back. Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff reckons that while fortunes have improved for his squad in recent outings a much better picture would emerge from the Brazilian GP. Pushed on if he felt Mercedes was ahead of Ferrari Wolff said I wouldnt want to say that because they are a strong team and weve had a few strong Sundays now. But maybe this circuit flattered us. I think after Brazil well have maybe more of a picture but I dont think theyre suddenly half a minute slower than us. George Russell Mercedes W13 Carlos Sainz Ferrari F175 Charles Leclerc Ferrari F175 Photo by Sam Bloxham  Motorsport Images Ferrari is hopeful that the scale of its deficit in Mexico was a oneoff caused by altitude which meant its power unit could not perform as well as it does nearer sealevel. However team principal Mattia Binotto said that a lack of power did not offer a full explanation for why it was so far adrift of Red Bull and Mercedes. I think the compromise both of them drivers are mentioning certainly is in terms of power unit we were not at our best performance for the weekend he said. But I dont think that thats explaining the most. Thats part of the equation but there is certainly more than that and its something which we need to look at. There is not a clear answer right now. The ride was not great. The balance was not great. Im pretty sure if Im listening at the drivers later on in the debriefing they will tell me that the car was not turning. The reason why I think it has to be looked at and we have not a clear explanation right now. Additional reporting by Filip Cleeren
Alpine: Alonso F1 engine failures are "luck of the draw", https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/alpine-alonso-f1-engine-failures-are-luck-of-the-draw/10394180/, After the race Alonso reflected on how many engine problems he has had in 2022 and how they always seemed to happen to his car. So again this was an engine issue said Szafnauer when asked why there was a pattern. And we dont have the same people preparing an Esteban engine or a Fernando engine they all mix around. Esteban in the latter half of the race started losing water pressure so we had to lift and coast it he explained. But we dont know the root cause., Listen to this article The Spaniard was forced to retire from last weekends race on the 64th lap with a cylinder issue while running in seventh place. The retirement cost Alpine priceless points in its battle with McLaren for fourth in the F1 world championship. After the race Alonso reflected on how many engine problems he has had in 2022 and how they always seemed to happen to his car. So again this was an engine issue said Szafnauer when asked why there was a pattern. And we dont have the same people preparing an Esteban engine or a Fernando engine they all mix around. The probability of this happening isnt zero. So it can happen. But it is lower to always to have it on one side or the other. But when I was at Honda I cant remember how many engine failures Takuma Sato had like 13 in a year and Jenson Button had none. Zero. And the question always came up we couldnt find anything to show that it was one side or the other. And at that point the questions were always does Takuma drive it so much differently to Jenson that it always happens on his side I think it was just the luck of the draw. So I think its the luck of the draw this time. Pressed on whether or not there was a reason he said Not that we can find. So its not that we can see that Its this set of circumstances its always on Fernandos side. An exasperated Fernando Alonso Alpine F1 Team after retiring from the race Photo by Carl Bingham  Motorsport Images Szafnauer admitted that he understood that Alonso might be upset Look we apologise to Fernando. You always feel frustrated when youre managing a race forward backward. I mean there was no risk whatsoever. And you know the points are in the bag no ones pushing you. And that makes it even more frustrating. So I get it. The race initially went to plan for Alpine with Alonso and teammate Esteban Ocon crucially ahead of the McLarens of Lando Norris and Daniel Ricciardo. Alonso also gained a place from Valtteri Bottas with Ocon jumping the Finn later on. Once we were ahead of them it was just about managing said Szafnauer. Fernando for example was driving at about a second a lap slower than he could have. And just managing temperatures brakes. We knew it was going to be tough to get it to the end. And Esteban on the other hand did a really good job to get ahead of the McLarens. We initially set out to go on to the hard. But then we did see that the soft was possible too we watched some others. We didnt react too quickly. And Lewiss lap time was really good on the hard. So we kept with our strategy which would have worked well to the end. But Fernando had his cylinder issue which meant he had to stop. We tried to get him to limp home but eventually he couldnt. He had that issue for about 13 to 14 laps before we stopped him. The good news for Alonso is that he should have enough power unit elements in his pool to make it through the last two races without penalty This engine was never going to run again anyway. However the root cause we dont know yet. It could have been a sparkplug could have been a piston ring could have been excessive knock. Szafnauer also revealed Ocon didnt have a straightforward race to his eighth place either. Esteban in the latter half of the race started losing water pressure so we had to lift and coast it he explained. We dont know what it is yet. But it looked like it was a small water leak in the water system somewhere which is why you start losing pressure. And the best way is to stabilise it. If you can imagine if youre boiling water the pressure will raise in whatever vessel its in and you bring it down you cool it down less pressure less leak. So it didnt cause any damage. But we dont know the root cause.
Mercedes junior gets first F1 test - but is he another Russell?, https://the-race.com/formula-1/mercedes-junior-gets-first-f1-test-but-is-he-another-russell/, Mercedes junior Frederik Vesti will pilot one of the teams Formula 1 cars in the postseason Abu Dhabi Grand Prix test but can he follow in the footsteps of George Russell and progress to F1 Danish driver Vesti will get his first taste of F1 machinery in the Yas Marina test at which current Mercedes reserve Nyck de Vries is set to make an early debut for his 2023 employer AlphaTauri. Theres little immediate competition within the top ranks of the Mercedes junior programme  although 16yearold Andrea Kimi Antonelli might just be the next big thing  so Vesti was the obvious choice for the young driver test with De Vries leaving for AlphaTauri. Its still a small vindication for the hard work hes put in behind the scenes on Mercedes simulator this year. Clearly Mercedes has little room within its own F1 team with Russell thriving since he joined at the start of the year and Hamilton likely to extend his current deal beyond 2023., Mercedes junior Frederik Vesti will pilot one of the teams Formula 1 cars in the postseason Abu Dhabi Grand Prix test but can he follow in the footsteps of George Russell and progress to F1 Danish driver Vesti will get his first taste of F1 machinery in the Yas Marina test at which current Mercedes reserve Nyck de Vries is set to make an early debut for his 2023 employer AlphaTauri. De Vries was on AlphaTauris radar earlier than you might think Read more Vesti joined the Mercedes junior programme off the back of his rookie FIA Formula 3 campaign in 2020 where overall he fell short of his more experienced Prema teammates Oscar Piastri and Logan Sargeant who are both headed for F1 in 2023 with McLaren and Williams respectively although Sargeants deal is yet to be confirmed and he requires super licence points. Although he couldnt join them in the title fight and was generally thirdbest among them he did match and outshine them on occasion. He remained in F3 for 2021 and switched to another junior singleseater behemoth ART Grand Prix but a title challenge failed to materialise and he finished fourth for the second consecutive season with a single victory. Vesti then stepped up to Formula 2 with ART racing alongside Sauber protege Theo Pourchaire who along with Piastri and Sargeant had beaten Vesti in F3 in 2020. Pourchaire leads that intrateam fight as he runs second in the drivers championship heading into the Abu Dhabi finale while Vesti is eighth but only nine points adrift from fourth place. Following a tricky start where he was pointless in the opening five races Vesti looked seriously quick in the middle of the season. He picked up his maiden F2 win in Baku qualified on the front row at Silverstone and then was on pole at the Red Bull Ring. That Austrian GP feature race was a disaster as a tardy start was followed by penalties for leaving the track and gaining an advantage and track limits violations that left Vesti emptyhanded from a weekend where he looked so strong. More pointless weekends would come later in the year at Spa and Zandvoort but this was followed by an excellent brace of second place finishes at Monza such has been the rollercoaster nature of Vestis season. Consistency over a season has been lacking for Vesti since he won the Formula Regional European Championship in 2019 in a field that rarely exceeded 11 cars. Its hardly been as convincing a rise up F1s ladder as the likes of Russell who won GP3 now F3 and F2 in backtoback years but not every future F1 driver has to boast that kind of record. This years F2 season has been one of the most bizarre inconsistent and hard to read in the championships history. Vesti has by no means stood head and shoulders among that field this year but equally hes not been far off star rookie Sargeant and Jack Doohan both of whom were right among F1s 2023 silly season. Vesti will likely reunite with Prema  responsible for four of the last seven F2GP2 champions  for a second year of F2 in 2023 so he should have the right tools to deliver a potential title challenge. Theres little immediate competition within the top ranks of the Mercedes junior programme  although 16yearold Andrea Kimi Antonelli might just be the next big thing  so Vesti was the obvious choice for the young driver test with De Vries leaving for AlphaTauri. Its still a small vindication for the hard work hes put in behind the scenes on Mercedes simulator this year. Clearly Mercedes has little room within its own F1 team with Russell thriving since he joined at the start of the year and Hamilton likely to extend his current deal beyond 2023. But Vesti can still put himself in the conversation for a 2024 F1 seat somewhere on the grid if he can excel in F2 next year against some stiff competition including likely returnees Doohan Pourchaire and Dennis Hauger as well as his probable new Prema teammate highlyrated Ferrari junior Ollie Bearman. Comparisons to Russell are optimistic at this stage of Vestis career hes shown flashes of real speed but hes yet to string it together in a convincing enough fashion to demand promotion to F1 in the same way Russells results and work with Mercedes did throughout 2017 and 2018. Its down to Vesti to change that in Abu Dhabi and in 2023.

Ferrari also won seven constructors world championships and 54 grands prix during that period. Forghieri had fallings out and was moved aside by Ferrari in the late 1960s and early 1970s but never for long. Forghieri was obviously a tremendous engineer and Luca was very good at telling the Old Man Ferrari about what was happening he wrote. Formula 1 president Stefano Domenicali said I am very saddened to hear the news that our friend Mauro Forghieri has passed away., Mauro Forghieri the technical director and designer who helped Ferrari win a string of Formula One titles from the 1960s through to the 1980s has died in Italy at the age of 87. Legends last forever...Its been an honour making history together. Ferrari and the world of motorsport will never forget you the team said on Twitter. Forghieri then only 27 years old was asked by founder Enzo Ferrari to take over the technical side of the team in 1961 after joining as a trainee from university with a degree in mechanical engineering. The Ferrari designer and engineer Mauro Forghieri has died in Italy at the age of 87 His cuttingedge innovation to Ferraris cars helped them win several Formula One titles Britains John Surtees 1964 Austrian Niki Lauda 1975 1977 and South African Jody Scheckter 1979 all won championships under his watch.

Forghieri had fallings out and was moved aside by Ferrari in the late 1960s and early 1970s but never for long. His Ferrari 312T car in various guises won four constructors and three drivers championships with Lauda and Scheckter. Forghieri right speaks with the French driver Patrick Tambay at the 1983 Austrian Grand Prix Forghieri was only 27 when Enzo Ferrari asked him to take over the design of their cars The engineer with Ferrari driver Michele Alboreto at the street race in Detroit in June 1984 Lauda who died in 2019 and was famously direct recalled in an autobiography how the combination of Forghieri and team manager Luca di Montezemolo helped forge a winning outfit after he arrived at Maranello in 1974. Forghieri was obviously a tremendous engineer and Luca was very good at telling the Old Man Ferrari about what was happening he wrote. Formula 1 president Stefano Domenicali said I am very saddened to hear the news that our friend Mauro Forghieri has passed away. He was a huge part of F1 and Ferrari and leaves behind an incredible legacy for all of us. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends at this sad time.
Formula 1's Las Vegas Grand Prix Is Going to Cost More Than Monaco, https://jalopnik.com/formula-1s-las-vegas-grand-prix-is-going-to-cost-more-t-1849730690, Formula 1s upcoming 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix is one of the more hyped events to join the series calendar and now it looks like prices are going to reflect that hype. That officially makes this race more expensive than the Monaco Grand Prix  and thats also not taking into account the massive number of lush packages that are said to be available to VIPs. If you want a little perspective grandstand tickets for a full weekend at the 2023 Monaco Grand Prix will run at maximum 410.59 using prices from Goo Tickets. The most expensive threeday grandstand ticket available via Grand Prix Tickets is just about 1500. It seems like the Las Vegas Grand Prix is catering to a bigticket buyer and the rest of us will be left in the dust., Formula 1s upcoming 2023 Las Vegas Grand Prix is one of the more hyped events to join the series calendar and now it looks like prices are going to reflect that hype. According to presale information via the tracks website youre going to be paying 500 for General Admission alone  or 2000 if you want a guaranteed seat. That officially makes this race more expensive than the Monaco Grand Prix  and thats also not taking into account the massive number of lush packages that are said to be available to VIPs. If you want a little perspective grandstand tickets for a full weekend at the 2023 Monaco Grand Prix will run at maximum 410.59 using prices from Goo Tickets. The most expensive threeday grandstand ticket available via Grand Prix Tickets is just about 1500. Im going to be honest If I paid 500 to literally stand around in one small flat area of Las Vegas in the hopes of seeing a race car on a street circuit and could get my hands on no beverage more powerful than a 0 Heineken Id snap. That right there would be my Joaquin Phoenix Joker moment. Advertisement If you were looking for a grandstand ticket you can expect to pay somewhere between 2000 and 2500  though it currently isnt clear if those are static ticket prices or if those are just the starting price for certain grandstands. For example at Circuit of the Americas certain rows of a grandstand may cost more than a different row of the same grandstand due to the view. Youll have to inquire about hospitality as well but Skybox shared hospitality is priced at 10000 for four days. I also want to note that these are presale prices listed via Ticketmaster knowing how Ticketmaster sales usually go theres a good chance scalpers are going to make a pretty penny on resales for the folks who didnt nab tickets right away.

Buy for 39 at Asystem Use the promo code INVENTORY15 Advertisement The thing that I find most fascinating is that these tickets are grouped together by small region and you only have access to that region. If you have tickets for hospitality in the South Koval Zone for example you cant go pop over to General Admission and see how things are going. You cant meet up with a friend behind the West Harmon Zone grandstands. I understand that temporary street circuits are inherently limited but Ive never seen such a cordoning off of track regions. Of course my experience largely comes from IndyCar where street circuits like Long Beach Detroit Toronto and St. Pete generally confine viewers to certain areas  but you can still wander around all those areas. In Miami for Formula 1 it was the same story there were a lot of places you couldnt go but any area open to one fan was open to all fans. Ive been looking forward to covering the event as media but it also makes me wonder how much Id actually get to see in order to report on the track ambiance. Advertisement Its going to be interesting to see how the limited fan experience plays out  though Im not sure many of the folks buying tickets are going to be the Average Joe who adores F1. It seems like the Las Vegas Grand Prix is catering to a bigticket buyer and the rest of us will be left in the dust.

Ferrari's Shwartzman 'very sad' at fading Formula 1 dream, https://www.motorsportweek.com/2022/11/02/ferraris-shwartzman-very-sad-at-fading-formula-1-dream/, Ferrari test driver Robert Shwartzman has conceded that his Formula 1 race ambitions are likely over after missing out on a seat for another season. What will happen in the future I dont know yet but its super hard and challenging to get into Formula 1. I dont really understand it the lineup and the driver decisions teams do I dont get it from my side. If you dont race you miss that spirit of being a race driver to fight to win and push yourself. Imagine if I dont race I will wait wait wait and if I have the opportunity I would not be ready for it as I had not raced since 2021., Ferrari test driver Robert Shwartzman has conceded that his Formula 1 race ambitions are likely over after missing out on a seat for another season. Shwartzman was among Ferraris leading junior prospects claiming the 2019 FIA Formula 3 title and finished fourth in his rookie Formula 2 campaign before placing runnerup to teammate Oscar Piastri in 2021. Of the 2020 crop champion Mick Schumacher Yuki Tsunoda and Nikita Mazepin stepped up to Formula 1 while from the 2021 group Zhou Guanyu debuted this year and champion Piastri will belatedly graduate with McLaren in 2023. Shwartzman instead took up a role with Ferrari as its official test driver and was tasked with undertaking extensive simulator duties. He was nominated as its young driver participating in FP1 in Austin and will partake in the corresponding session in Abu Dhabi. Offtrack Shwartzman also switched his racing license to Israel the country of his birth and has spent much of the year in Italy to where he moved as a child. Honestly it was a tough year Shwartzman tells MotorsportWeek.com. Unfortunately I didnt race which for any racing driver is a big thing. What will happen in the future I dont know yet but its super hard and challenging to get into Formula 1. I always pushed and worked really hard it didnt matter what was going around with the dream or target to get to Formula 1. Will it happen or not happen At this stage I dont know. I can guess maybe not. And thats obviously very sad for me because it has been such a big work and I kept on pushing and believing and at the end still it doesnt happen for various reasons. Shwartzman accepts that the thing I could have done a bit better is bring the results those years in 2020 and 2021 and that would probably give me a bigger help to get into F1 but stresses theres still no guarantee Id be there. There is also an aspect of disillusionment with the structure of the driver market. I mean F1 is a bit weird to be honest these days for me at least he says. I dont really understand it the lineup and the driver decisions teams do I dont get it from my side. I dont want to put names but for me unfortunately it doesnt always go by the merit. Oscar had to wait a year and it was a bit messy for him. I put myself in it as well I pushed him hard did hard work and I know if I would have a chance Id show Im capable. It is what it is at this stage its the situation where I cant do anything about it even though Id love to and make it more fair. Robert Shwartzman RUS  ISR Ferrari Developement Driver. United States Grand Prix Friday 21st October 2022. Circuit of the Americas Austin Texas USA. When pressed on why he feels that way Shwartzman replies Well I cant go up to a team and say take me because I really deserve it and would bring the results I cant do that because I can say it prove it and show it on eventual results but the decisionmaking thing is not going to be on me. So looking at how it is now its maybe not the main priority for them. The status of 2019 F2 champion Nyck de Vries is raised with the Dutchman sealing a 2023 AlphaTauri seat hugely facilitated by his substitute appearance with Williams at Monza. But Shwartzman isnt keen on such a strategy and wants to get back behind the wheel somewhere in 2023. Honestly for Nyck it happened after three years he raced and honestly I respect Nyck and think hes talented and good but the stars aligned perfectly for him and he did a good job of taking that opportunity  he got one shot and he took it Shwartzman explains. Will I Who knows. To wait and sit here and waste time not racing just hoping for a miracle to happen I would not really see it quite logical for me and anyway after doing this work I really want to race next year as I miss racing. If you dont race you miss that spirit of being a race driver to fight to win and push yourself. Imagine if I dont race I will wait wait wait and if I have the opportunity I would not be ready for it as I had not raced since 2021. So for me the main priority next year is to go race. Where I dont know we are looking at options and what we have on the table for the best offer possible and well see. Shwartzman is nonetheless hopeful that the recent setbacks will stand him in stronger stead for 2023 and beyond. Theres positives to take as I matured more I learned more I know how to handle myself better with the engineers how to work with them better so anyway for my career  it doesnt matter where I will be  it was an important phase in my life he reflects. We did a few tests with the old car I did the FP1 first time in Austin the first time in the car so it was very interesting and very cool. Well have another one in Abu Dhabi thats it not much driving unfortunately but it is what it is.

Other drivers he helped win the championships with at Ferrari included Niki Lauda and Jody Scheckter. When that project was completed he left Ferrari for good in 1987. Following his long career at Ferrari Forghieri moved to Lamborghini where he worked on its V12 engine that raced in F1 in 1989 and 1990. Otherwise in my eyes he is not a world champion.As the result of his historical contribution to Ferrari Forghieri receiving honorary citizenship of Modena last January., Listen to this article During a lengthy career as the technical chief at Ferrari from 1962 to 1984 he helped guide Ferrari to four drivers titles seven constructors crowns and 54 grand prix victories. He originally joined Ferrari as an apprentice in 1960 having graduated from the University of Bologna with a mechanical engineering degree. Having made a good early impression following the departure of then chief designer Carlo Chiti in 1961 he was asked by team founder Enzo Ferrari to step up to head up the technical aspects at the team. Enzo Ferrari and Mauro Forghieri Photo by David Phipps During his tenure he was instrumental in creating some of the squads most successful and famous F1 designs. This included the V8powered 158 that John Surtees won the world title with in 1964 as well as the 312 series of both grand prix and sportscar fame. Other drivers he helped win the championships with at Ferrari included Niki Lauda and Jody Scheckter. Forghieri finally left his position as technical director in 1984 and switched to a new role working on the Ferrari 408 4RM concept car. When that project was completed he left Ferrari for good in 1987. Following his long career at Ferrari Forghieri moved to Lamborghini where he worked on its V12 engine that raced in F1 in 1989 and 1990. He was also briefly involved in the ultimately stalled efforts for a new Lamborghinibacked GLAS F1 team which then became the Modena squad in 1991. When Lamborghinis engineering department was reorganised at the end of 1991 and the Modena team ran out of funding Forghieri left and helped setup the mechanical design Oral Engineering Group whose clients included BMW Bugatti and Aprilia. He was still involved with the project until recently. Mauro Forghieri consults Niki Lauda Photo by David Phipps The Italian kept a close eye on F1 and several years ago famously made it clear how he did not like the current rules that allowed for DRS. I dislike the whole aerodynamics of the current cars he said. I dont understand why it is not reduced in order to allow normal overtaking without DRS. Now if ones opponent is less than a second behind he can only watch as his pursuer goes past  and that cannot be correct. A world champion needs to be in a position to overtake his opponent without help. Otherwise in my eyes he is not a world champion.

Speaking to selected media including Autosport Hamilton said We are going to do another deal. Were going to sit down and were going to discuss it in these next couple of months I would say. Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff says his squad is not looking for anyone else as the seat was 100 Hamiltons. However he felt that there was no rush to get things settled immediately  and that it would be easier to sort things out including wider responsibilities beyond driving once the season was finished. We havent started having talks explained Wolff. We want to definitely finish the season and then find some quiet time over the winter like we have done last time around that literally started in the winter holidays and lasted over two months. We havent done that. But hes much more than a driver to us now. Although were not talking about a career end its also important to speak about his role as an ambassador for Mercedes and the many sponsors that we have and the implication he can have in our wider audience.

Reflecting on his relationship with the German manufacturer Hamilton said he had no desire to join any of its rivals. My goal is to continue to be with Mercedes. Ive been with Mercedes since I was 13. And it really is my family MercedesBenz is my family he said. Theyve stuck with me through thick and thin. They stuck with me through being expelled at school. They stuck with me through everything that was going on through 2020. Theyve stuck with me through my mistakes and shit thats been in the press theyve stuck with me through the ups and downs. I really believe in this brand. I believe in the people that are within the organisation. And I want to be the best teammate I can be to them because I think we can make the brand even better more accessible even stronger than it is. And I think I can be an integral part of that.
The underrated Verstappen trait behind his new F1 record, https://the-race.com/formula-1/the-underrated-verstappen-trait-behind-his-new-f1-record/, And it is no coincidence that the same drivers tend to excel in this area  with Verstappen certainly among them. Verstappens tyre management has won him races before this. His first victory in Spain in 2016 on his Red Bull debut is a favoured example. While the softmedium strategy didnt seem to be seriously on many peoples radar Red Bull was confident it was possible because it had two drivers capable of making it work. Even when Verstappen looked occasionally vulnerable to Hamiltons chasing Mercedes he always managed to keep it at arms length., Max Verstappens recordbreaking 14th victory in the 2022 Formula 1 season came down to something that he talked about after his ninth. Its not only today I think Im always good on tyres Verstappen said at the Belgian Grand Prix when asked about how well he had managed his Pirellis in an extended opening stint on softs. Maybe people dont look at it. Just as that win at Spa required a gentle touch to manage the softs and make a onestop strategy work effectively so too did his Mexican Grand Prix win last weekend. The implication with Verstappens answer at Spa obviously was that when the likes of Sergio Perez and Lewis Hamilton get hailed as tyre whisperers Verstappens own skill in this regard is underrated. He was right though. Verstappens headline qualities are his speed and his aggression. But he is a much more refined driver than that. Tyre management is one of F1s unsexy skills and can sometimes be dismissed as a particularly negative aspect of modern F1  as if it was never a factor in years gone by. It is a crucial skill. And it is no coincidence that the same drivers tend to excel in this area  with Verstappen certainly among them. Verstappens tyre management has won him races before this. His first victory in Spain in 2016 on his Red Bull debut is a favoured example. In Austria in 2018 he drove cleverly by lifting slightly through the highspeed corners to put a little less energy into them and avoid the blistering issues that struck thenteammate Ricciardo and Hamilton. That year he also obliterated Ricciardo in Mexico where he has now won four times pulling a full pitstop on him despite managing his laptimes and his tyres after grabbing the lead at the start. This year has provided different case studies. If there is a specific modern F1 demand it is that the working range of the Pirellis requires the tyre to be brought in carefully or they will not last as long as they should. Those who truly get on top of this have a wonderful sensitivity. They feel the tyre underneath them and usually know how hard they can push without taking it too far. At the same time if they do wander into some tyre strife they can get it back under control. For instance this helped Verstappen win the United States Grand Prix where after losing time in his pitstop he had to work the tyres harder than hed have liked running in the dirty air of the Ferrari of Charles Leclerc and then passing it. By his own admission I damaged my tyres a little bit too much in the beginning of that new tyre set and that meant Verstappen had to be restrained in his chase of Hamilton to recover the tyres. Which he did and then he pushed and then caught Hamilton and then he passed him to win. Verstappen has more patience in certain scenarios than he is given credit for aided by the growing confidence hes had that the car will have enough pace once the tyres are where they need to be. This was the case in Mexico a race that demands a lot of discipline. While the softmedium strategy didnt seem to be seriously on many peoples radar Red Bull was confident it was possible because it had two drivers capable of making it work. Even when Verstappen looked occasionally vulnerable to Hamiltons chasing Mercedes he always managed to keep it at arms length. I never really felt like I was under pressure I was just managing my tyres to get through that number of laps he said. The key Mercedes mistakes that surprised Red Bull in Mexico Read more Once Verstappen got a good idea of what the softs could handle he pushed to build his lead to over two seconds and that gave him a buffer as the tyres started to fall away right at the end of the stint. But he had done enough to make the long run on mediums realistic. It was still a question mark Verstappen said but within a few laps he had the feeling he needed to get to the end. Which he did. It was an achievement against Mercedes initial expectations but in keeping with Verstappens proficiency at not abusing the tyre and therefore another example of what Red Bull team boss Christian Horner believes Verstappen has been masterful at this year. When you see how hes playing with the tools that he has available to him within the car hes constantly on top of them said Horner. You hear the banter between him and his engineer and hes got a tremendous feel for what the tyres need and what they dont need and its something hes developed. Hes always been strong at it but I think this year hes been exceptional.

The technologyfocused startup was formed by the golf star duo of Tiger Woods and world No. 1 Rory McIlroy in August. The full list of investors is set to be released Wednesday. Woods and McIlroy were quick to welcome Hamilton on social media. The companys name is pronounced tomorrow sports. During the summer Woods described the company as a way to harness technology to bring fresh approaches to the sports we love. Former NBC Sports president Mike McCarley is the third cofounder and will serve as CEO. He said one of the companys major goals was to make sports more accessible for as many people as possible. TMRW Sports first official project is TGL a hightech golf league that will feature six teams made of the top PGA Tour players. TLG is scheduled to tee off in January 2024. Hamilton seems like a good fit for an already starstudded company. Since his debut season in 2007. He holds the record for most wins pole positions and podium finishes among many other records in racing. One of his hobbies also helps him fit in quite well with Woods and McIlroy. Ahead of the Miami Grand Prix in May the driver teamed up with NFL veteran quarterback Tom Brady in a fundraiser event at Miami Beach Golf Club. Earlier this year Hamilton also became an investor for the Denver Broncos after joining the WaltonPenner Family Ownership Group. His involvement in sports outside of racing will likely continue to grow. In a story published by Reuters in September Hamilton said he wanted to boost Black ownership and equity in the sport. I do want to get more and more involved in teams because I really do believe in Black ownership because there is a lack of it within sports and Black equity. There is a real lack of that he said.

Norris: Mexico F1 strategy "a mistake" relative to McLaren teammate Ricciardo, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/norris-mexico-strategy-mistake-ricciardo/10393568/, In contrast Norris who stopped earlier joined several others in going from the medium to the hard only to find it was lacking performance. He finished ninth some 16.5 seconds behind Ricciardo on the road having been three places ahead of him early on. Just one off the line and then one around the first few corners which is just a bit unlucky sometimes. He added We covered Yuki Tsunoda very early on which meant I had to go onto the hard tyre. I wouldnt say Brazil is going to suit us at all with our balance of the car and so on and our struggles., Listen to this article Ricciardo went from medium to soft tyres and had sufficient pace to not only charge up to seventh place but also negate a 10second penalty for contact with Yuki Tsunoda. In contrast Norris who stopped earlier joined several others in going from the medium to the hard only to find it was lacking performance. He finished ninth some 16.5 seconds behind Ricciardo on the road having been three places ahead of him early on. The Englishmans race had already been compromised by a difficult first lap in which he was passed by Fernando Alonso and Esteban Ocon of Alpine the team that McLaren is battling for fourth position in the world championship. I lost just two places in the beginning obviously both to Alpines which is the main thing he explained when asked by Motorsport.com about his start. Just one off the line and then one around the first few corners which is just a bit unlucky sometimes. So nothing too bad just the way it is. The rest I think we did a reasonable job. Norris made it clear that he did not get to run the strategy that he had hoped to use estimating that Ricciardos strategy was worth over 30 seconds over his own. He added We covered Yuki Tsunoda very early on which meant I had to go onto the hard tyre. So I would not really what I wanted to do. So maybe a bit of a mistake there to do that. But Daniel did what I wanted to do which was to stay out and then go onto the soft which was like 3040 seconds quicker in terms of race time. I think we did the best we could. Still managed to get past Bottas bought us with a few laps to go. So that one extra point always helps. Regarding the general lack of grip he said I mean thats just what we have to deal with. Yeah we made a mistake going onto the hard tyre. You dont have to use it we chose to. Thats life. Esteban Ocon Alpine A522 Lando Norris McLaren MCL36 Yuki Tsunoda AlphaTauri AT03 Photo by Sam Bloxham  Motorsport Images Norris is unsure about the teams potential form in Brazil as the battle with Alpine over fourth in the constructors title continues. The Enstone outfit currently leads by just seven points with two races remaining on the calendar and Norris was not especially buoyant about McLarens chances in Brazil. It makes me happy that were closing the gap he said. But were working hard. So I feel like we deserve to be getting what were getting at the end of the day. But it means we still have to work extremely hard to beat them over the next two races. I dont know how were going to do to be honest with you. I wouldnt say Brazil is going to suit us at all with our balance of the car and so on and our struggles. But I think even the last few races weve not been the quickest car or quick enough weve just done a better job with the strategy and with reliability such as today. So lets get to the chequered flag.

Left At Paul Ricard Red Bull moved the two outermost tunnel inlet vanes further apart. Suspension Red Bull like McLaren responded to the new regulations by switching around their suspension from pushrod frontpullrod rear to the opposite. Inset right A beautiful detail is the adjustment of the ride height outside of the pedal box. Red Bull introduced a new engine cover at Silverstone with a channel between the upper and lower parts forming a bulge., The Red Bull RB18 will go down as one of the most successful F1 cars in the sports history. In taking Max Verstappen to his second world title and the team to their fifth constructors championship their first in nine years it has won 16 of the seasons 20 races to date  14 for Verstappen and two for Sergio Perez. It has proven to be a masterwork response to a set of radically new aerodynamic regulations which have been problematic for most other teams. Chief Technical Officer Adrian Newey feeds into the Red Bull technical group which created the car a group that includes Technical Director Pierre Wache Head of Aerodynamics Enrico Balbo Chief Engineering Officer Rob Marshall Chief Designer Craig Skinner Head of Performance Engineering Ben Waterhouse and Chief Engineer car Paul Monaghan. Newey has experience of ground effect cars from much earlier in his career and certainly he will have been aware of some of the possible hazards lying in wait with such a concept of car featuring an arodynamically superpowerful underbody. But Neweys actual design input in this case is limited to the suspension  though that is a crucial part of the cars allround excellence. READ MORE Verstappen makes F1 history as he beats Hamilton to victory in Mexico for 14th win of the season The car is powered by Hondas powerful reliable and compact RA621 a refinement of the power unit introduced in 2021. Around this Red Bull created a car with a distinctive and elegant sidepod layout with a deep undercut at the front beneath the inlet vanes to the venturi tunnels at the heart of the new regulations. Here we look at each of the key design elements of the car and what has differentiated it from its rivals. Verstappen and the RB18 have formed a dominant partnership this season winning 14 races out of 20 so far Floor The underfloor is absolutely key to performance under these regulations with downforce generated by tunnels either side of a central flat keel. The speed of the air flowing through these tunnels and the air pressure differential between the underfloor and the upper surface of the car creates massive downforce effectively sucking the car to the ground. READ MORE Hes been perfect  Horner full of praise after Verstappens recordbreaking victory But Red Bulls treatment of the tunnels is quite different to that of any other car. Others have created a teardropshaped central keel to shape the tunnels around but the Red Bulls keel is far less uniform in shape. The roof of the tunnels also appear to be higher and more arched. The combination of the profile changes of the keel and the varying height of the tunnels seems to be an effort at carefully matching the volume of the tunnel along its length to give a more consistent airflow and at no point has the car been seriously troubled by the porpoising phenomenon seen elsewhere. Ferrari underfloor left contrasted with that of Red Bull right. It can be seen that the central keel of the RB18 floor is nothing like the conventional teardrop shape on the F175. This seems to be part of a very careful matching with the height of the tunnels either side to give a more consistent volume for the airflow. This would theoretically lower the peak downforce generated by the floor but make it far more stallproof and tolerant of different ride heights. The key to these regulations has proved to be not how much peak downforce can be created by the floor through highspeed corners when the rear ride height is low but how much can be retained in slower corners when the ride height is greater. The Red Bulls floor arrangement is much more tolerant of ride height changes than others even if GPS data suggests it doesnt achieve as high a maximum downforce as the Ferrari or the Mercedes in faster corners. READ MORE I never thought Id be able to win 14 races in a year says recordbreaker Verstappen in Mexico Even the profile of the edges of the inlet vanes to the tunnel are nonuniform and seem to be matched to the profile of the tunnel. Red Bull used a variety of inlet vane and floor edge arrangements to tune the car to particular circuits. These changes would vary aero characteristics of the car and the centre of pressure acting upon the front and rear axles. It suggested the team had a very high fidelity control of its underfloor airflow. Left At Paul Ricard Red Bull moved the two outermost tunnel inlet vanes further apart. Although the team regularly tweaked the shape of these vanes to match specific circuit demands this was the biggest change. Right This tonguelike insert in the floor ahead of the rear tyres was introduced at Silverstone and is similar to a feature first seen on the Ferrari. Its believed to relieve excess pressure created in that part of the floor by tyre squirt at low ride heights. Suspension Red Bull like McLaren responded to the new regulations by switching around their suspension from pushrod frontpullrod rear to the opposite. Red Bull felt that the pullrod arrangement at the front  with the rockers up high  allowed a better airflow route to the tunnel inlets while at the rear a pushrod arrangement gave a better stiffer and lighter mechanical installation. Previously the high rockers of a pullrod rear had allowed more scope to powerfully develop the brake duct shapes but with these a standardised item for 2022 that scope was no longer there. MONDAY MORNING DEBRIEF How cunning strategy allowed us to see Ricciardo back at his best in Mexico The rear suspension had a notably long travel to accommodate a variety of ride heights. It would sink very low at high speed to reduce drag even though it usually had a greater static ride height than any other car. This was a key part of the cars consistent straightline speed advantage over the competition. To get the car to sink in such a way would require a relatively soft suspension springing rate and on other cars such a setting would induce bouncing. The Red Bull floors resistance to aerodynamic stalling was probably part of enabling the softer suspension to work. Main image Red Bulls 2022 front suspension in detail. Left inset Red Bulls 2021 pushrod layout. It is now the front upper arm which passes through the chassis whereas previously it was the front lower arm. That upper arm is mounted higher than the rear lower arm not visible here giving an antidive geometry. Inset right A beautiful detail is the adjustment of the ride height outside of the pedal box. On other cars notably the Mercedes the suspension had to be run stiff enough to keep the car outside of the ride heightspeed combinations which would induce bouncing at a frequency and would then cause the car to be bouncing on its tyre sidewalls too. The Red Bull was seemingly completely immune from this. At the front Newey had opted for a multilink arrangement once again with the upper forward link mounted high and the upper rearwards link lower to resist the dive of the car under braking thereby limiting the rear ride height increase and the downforce loss it entails. READ MORE 6 Winners and 5 Losers from the Mexico City Grand Prix  Who left the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez on a high A beautiful detail was having the ride height adjuster on the external part of the suspension usually its within the central part with the rockers for easy access. The multilink arrangement  with separate attachment points for the various suspension links  will be heavier but it allows those links to work more independently and thereby give a better ride quality. This gives a more stable aerodynamic platform. As a side benefit the car will be better over the kerbs. Red Bull introduced a new engine cover at Silverstone with a channel between the upper and lower parts forming a bulge. This both increased the cooling capacity and improved the airflow to the rear corner of the car normally two conflicting requirements.
Hamilton: Alonso’s comments about F1 titles "make me giggle a little bit", https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/hamilton-alonsos-comments-about-f1-titles-make-me-giggle-a-little-bit/10393547/, But in an apparent response to Alonsos comments Hamilton tweeted a picture of them on the podium together at Indianapolis in 2007 when they were teammates at McLaren accompanied with a single thumbs up emoji. Asked for his reaction to Alonsos comments and about the post Hamilton said I gave you my reaction. It does make me giggle a little bit to be honest but I have tried to be really respectful over the years. Lewis Hamilton McLaren and Fernando Alonso McLaren Photo by Steven Tee  Motorsport ImagesIts definitely interesting to see the comments that are made but it doesnt really matter. So thats why I just kind of put the thumbs up.Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff also brushed off Alonsos comments saying the twotime world champion was a teaser and it was comedy and that he doubted Hamilton cared., In an interview with Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf that was published last Saturday Alonso discussed the value of F1 titles won against drivers from other teams compared to those fought only against a teammate. Alonso took to Twitter after the quotes began to circulate to say that all titles are amazing and he was tired of the continuous search for headlines as well as suggesting F1 fans should stop being pitted against each other on social media. But in an apparent response to Alonsos comments Hamilton tweeted a picture of them on the podium together at Indianapolis in 2007 when they were teammates at McLaren accompanied with a single thumbs up emoji. Hamilton won that race ahead of Alonso who was left fuming at his McLaren team amid a tense season that resulted in Alonso leaving at the end of the year. Asked for his reaction to Alonsos comments and about the post Hamilton said I gave you my reaction. Thats my thumbs up. I dont really have a lot to say about it. It does make me giggle a little bit to be honest but I have tried to be really respectful over the years. For example when youve ever asked me about who has been the better driver for me Ive always tried to give praise.

So thats why I just kind of put the thumbs up. Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff also brushed off Alonsos comments saying the twotime world champion was a teaser and it was comedy and that he doubted Hamilton cared. It creates headlines and this sport is about headlines said Wolff. Theyre great champions. Alonso likes to throw one in. I dont think its bothering Lewis a millimetre. In the wake of the response to his comments Alonso said on Sunday when asked about Max Verstappens new win record that he would not speak any more about anyone else because I think theres always misunderstanding. It was not the first time there had been some tension emerging from comments Alonso made about Hamilton this year. Following their collision on the opening lap of the Belgian Grand Prix in August Alonso called Hamilton an idiot over team radio and claimed the seventime world champion could only race starting first. He later apologised for the comment.
How F1 teams reacted to Mexico’s high-altitude headaches, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/how-f1-teams-reacted-to-mexicos-high-altitude-headaches/10393735/, All of this leads to teams running what might otherwise be considered odd choices given its such a highspeed venue. It was a similar story at the rear of the car too as both drivers flirted with different arrangements. The team also had the option of incorporating a Gurney flap on the trailing edge of the main engine cover outlet in order to help with extraction. Alpha Tauri AT03 cooling panel comparisonMeanwhile at the rear of the car the engine covers bodywork was expanded. This not only increased the size of the rear cooling outlet but also resulted in a larger rear deck upon which the air flowed to the rear of the car., Listen to this article At 2285m above sea level the rarefied air creates a significant challenge in respect of car aerodynamics cooling requirements and the performance envelope of the power unit. All of this leads to teams running what might otherwise be considered odd choices given its such a highspeed venue. Mercedes experimented with its wing levels on Friday not only as a means to hone in on the performance levels of the car at this venue but also for gathering meaningful data for next years car too. Comparing the two front wings put into service during free practice outings Lewis Hamiltons car was fitted with the older specification version with the trailing edge of the upper flap cut back quite significantly left image below. Meanwhile George Russells W13 was fitted with the new wing design which features a revised design to the outer section of the flaps and a more contoured endplate to help generate outwash. However the team did opt to remove the controversial slot gap separator brackets that first appeared at the United States Grand Prix but remain unraced. Youll also note that chequerboard stickers were adhered to the front wing endplate on Hamiltons car with a camera used to capture footage of the wing whilst its out on track in order that the team can ascertain its performing as anticipated. It was a similar story at the rear of the car too as both drivers flirted with different arrangements. George Russell carried a Gurney flap mounted on the trailing edge of the rear wing whilst Hamilton matching the cutdown approach taken with the front wing was running the wing without one on his. Following the tests conducted by Hamilton on Friday both drivers opted for the newer front wing specification with a more loaded flap arrangement plus the Gurney on the trailing edge of the rear wings upper flap for qualifying and the race. Meanwhile the maximum cooling option was taken up on both cars with the panels beside the cockpit and the engine cover gills both opened up in order to reject the heat being generated. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes W13 Photo by Steven Tee  Motorsport Images Red Bull also opted for more cooling to meet the demands being posed as the RB18 ran with the louvred cooling panels on the shoulder of the engine cover and a new wider cooling exit at the rear that also flared on the trailing edge to help with extraction. McLaren decided to take cooling in Mexico pretty seriously as several new options appeared in order to deal with the demands posed by the circuit and altitude. A more expansive louvred cooling panel could be found traversing the MCL36s sidepod and engine cover with two outlets also added to its cooling suite on the engine covers spine one of these is mounted above the power unit saddle coolers and the other is just aft of the shark fin red arrows. The team also had the option of incorporating a Gurney flap on the trailing edge of the main engine cover outlet in order to help with extraction. To increase local load at the rear of the car McLaren had also made changes to its rear brake duct aero adding some winglets to the stack already present on the rearwardfacing outlet scoop. Alpine also deployed its maximum cooling configuration as the A522 was fitted with the open louvred sidepod bodywork and the enlarged engine cover outlet panel that was last seen in Hungary but not raced. Alpine F1 A522 cooling detail Photo by Giorgio Piola Alpha Tauri invested in revisions to help with its temperature issues in Mexico too as the AT03s front brakes featured an enlarged rear outlet scoop resulting in an increase in mass flow through the assembly. The cooling gill panel on the side of the engine cover was also revised with the number of louvres reduced but their spacing increased as they still filled the same available space within the panel. Alpha Tauri AT03 cooling panel comparison Meanwhile at the rear of the car the engine covers bodywork was expanded. This not only increased the size of the rear cooling outlet but also resulted in a larger rear deck upon which the air flowed to the rear of the car. Alfa Romeo has been proactive in the closing stages of the season as it not only looks to fend off the challenge posed by Aston Martin but also invest in designs that will carry across to its 2023 challenger. And whilst not a new feature having been used at other high downforce venues the larger rear wing endplate tip cutout used in Mexico is a feature worthy of our attention owing to its impact on the resultant tip vortex being generated. Alfa Romeo C42 rear wing cutout comparison Photo by Giorgio Piola Compared with the medium downforce wings cutout inset theres a clear difference in approach with its high downforce arrangement as the flap is undercut red arrow. This is the result of the team looking for a better tradeoff between the downforce and drag being generated given it is trying to maintain as much wingspan as possible. The team has also made changes to the forward section of the floor over the course of the last two races as it looks to increase the downforce being generated and its working range. This includes changes to the outermost floor fence and the point at which it connects with the side of the chassis.

Word surfaced that Verstappen had taken issue with Sky Sports coverage relating to one individual at the broadcaster in particular believed to be their pitlane reporter Ted Kravitz who on several occasions had used the word robbed when discussing how Lewis Hamilton had missed out on the 2021 title to Verstappen. With Red Bull said to have joined in Verstappens silence multiple occurrences during Skys Mexican Grand Prix race coverage suggested that was true starting with Martin Brundles grid walk when he had the opportunity to approach Red Bulls design chief Adrian Newey but did not. Then postrace Sky used mixedzone interviews with Verstappen and his teammate Sergio Perez while Red Bull team principal Christian Horner who usually appears for an interview at every round did not do so. Verstappen postrace confirmed his stance and explained it. It had nothing to do with this weekend. But this year its been a constant yeah kind of like daily being disrespectful especially one particular person said Verstappen. And its enough I dont accept it. You cant live in the past. You just have to move on. Social media is a very toxic place and if you are constantly being like that live on TV you make it only worse instead of trying to make it better. You keep disrespecting me and at one point Im not tolerating it anymore. Thats why I decided to stop answering them. Horner has said Verstappen and the Red Bull team will be talking to Sky at the next event the Sao Paulo Grand Prix so bar any further fallouts that should be the end of the matter. But fallouts with the media are not unheard of  just ask Renault. In 2020 Ziggo Sports Jack Plooij issued an apology after he called Renault driver Esteban Ocon a French f on live television while he was interviewing Lando Norris. Ocon accepted the apology although that was not the first time Ziggo Sport had found themselves in hot water with Renault. Renault had previously blocked the Dutch broadcaster from onetoone access with Daniel Ricciardo as they reportedly wanted to ask the Australian if Verstappen was better than him.

But as part of talks in Formula 1s Sporting Advisory Committee where teams are represented by their sporting directors it has emerged that a winter shutdown has now been proposed. This would see a similar approach be taken to the summer shutdown putting a fixed period in the rules where all teams must pause operations and staff members will get time off.

There are many of us team principals that would like to replicate what we have in the summer at least starting at Christmas and going into the new year for two weeks explained Wolff. Obviously thats still up for discussion. But there was a positive indication for the wellbeing of the people. Mclaren garage Photo by Erik Junius With the final race of the season scheduled for November 20 in Abu Dhabi this year will mark the earliest finish to a campaign since 2010 when the title showdown was held on November 14. The early finish this year was a result of the FIFA World Cup which starts in Qatar on the same day as the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and will continue until the middle of December. F1 held its last race in December in each of the past three seasons running as late as December 13 in 2020 and December 12 in 2021 after the COVID19 pandemic forced changes to the schedule. With only one preseason test planned in Bahrain next year ahead of the seasonopener on March 5 it is set to be the longest winter break that staff have enjoyed for a number of years. Its great that the season finishes this couple of weeks earlier than in the past because everyone is really at the limit said Wolff. Having this week two weeks more is definitely a nice welcome but on the other side theres many people in the factory who are going to work flat out between Christmas and New Year. But for the race team thats clocking many airline miles thats a positive.

'I felt fast but once again Car 14 stops' – Alonso frustrated after fifth DNF of the season in Mexico | Formula 1�, https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.i-felt-fast-but-once-again-car-14-stops-alonso-frustrated-after-fifth-dnf-of.5DJ8dYBebtwT5Q05yxzDGg.html, Having seen strong points slip away on each occasion the Spaniard was left frustrated at the recurring reliability issues. Car 14 stops before the chequered flag so I think now we lost about 70 points Alonso said. Alonso frustrated after another failure I felt fast today but once again car 14 stopsWe are still happy with our strategy of pushing hard and having a car that performs. He did well to bring the car home in eighth place and score some valuable points for the team. Im confident we can rectify these issues going into the final two races of the season., The sight of Fernando Alonso punching the air in frustration alongside his stricken car is one that will stick out from the race in Mexico as his time with Alpine nears its end. Alonso was running a competitive seventh when he started to suffer from a loss of power and eventually had to retire his car at Turn 1 inside the final 10 laps to register his third retirement in five races. Having seen strong points slip away on each occasion the Spaniard was left frustrated at the recurring reliability issues. Car 14 stops before the chequered flag so I think now we lost about 70 points Alonso said. But its pointless to talk about this once more so lets see. Only two races to go and then a new chapter. MONDAY MORNING DEBRIEF How cunning strategy allowed us to see Ricciardo back at his best in Mexico I think Austin and Mexico have been the best races from a personal point of view. Pacewise I was like 20 seconds or something like that ahead of the McLarens and my team mate. I felt fast but once again Car 14 stops. Alonso was running in seventh before he stopped on track with an issue Team mate Ocon did gain a position as a result of Alonsos misfortune but then was unable to keep Daniel Ricciardo at bay late on. With a 10second time penalty hanging over the McLaren driver Ricciardo was able to pull enough of a gap to retain seventh place after his punishment was handed out leaving Ocon in eighth. I think we didnt put everything together but we fought hard the whole way Ocon said. Damage limitation I would call it. Obviously we lost Fernando we were supposed to have a doublepoints finish. READ MORE Verstappen makes F1 history as he beats Hamilton to victory in Mexico for 14th win of the season I was managing the cooling issue we were having a lot and thats mainly why we lost to Daniel. Happy for him on one side but not happy on the other side because we lost out as a team. So damage limitation well keep fighting in the last two rounds. Reliability has arguably been Alpines biggest weakness this season but Ocon is comfortable with the tradeoff of chasing performance first and foremost. Alonso frustrated after another failure I felt fast today but once again car 14 stops We are still happy with our strategy of pushing hard and having a car that performs. The pace was good when we didnt have to manage so much so it was solid in that regard. Its a stance echoed by Team Principal Otmar Szafnauer who was unhappy at losing Alonso late on but believes Alpine can find fixes for their problems ahead of the penultimate round in Brazil. FACTS AND STATS Verstappen sets new season records for points and wins Unfortunately Fernando suffered a cylinder failure on Lap 52 and he was having to manage on five cylinders  meaning a significant lack of power  to try and remain inside the points Szafnauer said. Eventually the problem was not sustainable and he had to retire the car. Esteban faced a challenge with some cooling issues from quite early on in the race where he had to liftandcoast and therefore he sacrificed significant lap time. He did well to bring the car home in eighth place and score some valuable points for the team. We know reliability is going to be the key in our championship battle and its something that has let us down after showing such a strong level of performance in recent races. Im confident we can rectify these issues going into the final two races of the season.

Hamilton saw the funny side on that occasion too and gave Alonso a signed Mercedes cap ahead of the next race., Lewis Hamilton said Fernando Alonso questioning the value of his Formula One titles made him giggle a little bit. Ahead of the Mexican GP Alonso told Dutch media that Max Verstappens two world titles are worth more than Hamiltons seven because the Red Bull driver has not just beaten his teammate to claim them. Hamilton and Michael Schumachers seven world championships are tied for the most in F1 history. Hamilton responded to the comments on Sunday on social media with a thumbsup emoji alongside a picture of himself standing on the podium with Alonso at the 2007 U.S. Grand Prix when the British driver beat his thenMcLaren teammate to victory. When asked after the Mexican Grand Prix to respond Hamilton replied I gave you it. Thats my thumbs up. I dont really have a lot to say about it it does make me giggle a little bit to be honest. But I have tried to be really respectful over the years and for example when youve ever asked me about who has been the better driver for me Ive always tried to give praise. Its definitely interesting to see the comments that are made but it doesnt really matter. So thats why I just gave the thumbs up. Alonso quickly backtracked from his comments on social media himself tweeting And again... Please all the titles are amazing well deserved and inspiring. Incomparable to each other and lets enjoy champions and legends of our current time. Tired of the continuous search for headlines. Lets enjoy them. However its not the first time this season Alonso has taken a dig at Hamilton. After colliding on the opening lap of the Belgian Grand Prix a collision Hamilton was at fault for an angry Alonso said over his car radio What an idiot... this guy only knows how to drive and start in first. Hamilton saw the funny side on that occasion too and gave Alonso a signed Mercedes cap ahead of the next race.

Record-breaking Max Verstappen already an F1 great at 25, https://www.espn.com/f1/story/_/id/34916572/record-breaking-max-verstappen-already-f1-great-25, For the now double world champion Max Verstappen his first season of total dominance has come at the relatively young age of 25. With two races remaining in 2022 there is every chance Verstappen raises the bar to 16. More impressively he has won races from lowly grid positions which was rarely the case for the other Vettel and Schumacher. Vettel won all of his 13 races in 2013 from the front row of the grid while Schumacher won 11 of his 13 from the first two grid positions. Like him or not Verstappens performance this year has been truly exceptional., MEXICO CITY  Dominance by a single driver is common in Formula One but that doesnt mean its easy to attain. Many of the greats have enjoyed a season  or multiple seasons  of unbeatable form but the ease with which the victories fall always belies the hard work with which they were achieved. For the now double world champion Max Verstappen his first season of total dominance has come at the relatively young age of 25. By winning the Mexican Grand Prix on Sunday his 14th of the year Verstappen set a new record for race victories in a single season. The previous record of 13 was set in 2004 by Michael Schumacher during his dominant Ferrari years and equaled in 2013 by Sebastian Vettel while driving for Red Bull. With two races remaining in 2022 there is every chance Verstappen raises the bar to 16. Not that the man himself is interested in the numbers. I was never really interested in stats Verstappen said after securing his victory in Mexico. I just live in the moment try to do the best I can every single weekend. I try to win the races  that for me is the most important thing that when I go home I can say to myself that I maximized the performance and if Im close to that Im happy. But a lot in Formula One depends on the whole package and we have a great package right now. Im just enjoying the moment and Im not that interested in keeping in touch with every stat. But of course it has been an amazing season and of course I am very happy winning so many races. Max Verstappen has been almost unbeatable in 2022. Chris GraythenGetty Images As Verstappen has pointed out before comparing records across eras in Formula One is fraught with inconsistencies. Schumacher achieved his 13 wins in an 18race season Vettel scored his in a 19race season and Verstappen secured his first 13 wins of 2022 in 20 race period before taking No. 14 at the 21st race of the year. But while Verstappens season may be statistically less impressive with two races left to run he has arguably had a less dominant car than Schumacher and Vettel enjoyed in their record years. Whats more he has secured a number of his 14 wins in a more spectacular fashion. While the Red Bull is clearly the class of the field at this stage of the season Ferrari was a genuine threat for victories at every race in the early rounds of 2022. Looking at it one way you could argue the Italian team has gifted Verstappen additional wins  most notably in Spain when Charles Leclerc broke down and then in France when Leclerc crashed out of the lead  but the counter argument is that Verstappen has consistently been in a position to take advantage. More impressively he has won races from lowly grid positions which was rarely the case for the other Vettel and Schumacher. Vettel won all of his 13 races in 2013 from the front row of the grid while Schumacher won 11 of his 13 from the first two grid positions. Verstappen however has won six of his 14 from grid positions outside the top two and two of those were from way back in 10th and 14th on the grid in Hungary and Belgium. At a glance that could reflect negatively on his qualifying performance but his three lowliest grid positions that led to victories were all at races where he had either grid penalties for engine component changes Italy and Belgium or a power unit issue in qualifying Hungary. On top of that Ferrari has had a quicker car in qualifying at a number of races this year which was not the case among Vettels and Schumachers rivals when they were dominating. It means Verstappen has had to fight harder for the front row starting positions he has earned and to underline that point a surprising statistic from this year is that Leclerc has a higher average starting position 2.65 than Verstappens 2.70 while also securing nine poles to Verstappens seven. Again the comparison between eras is far from perfect but there is no doubt Verstappen has already put himself among the sports greatest drivers with many fruitful years of his career still to run. His team boss Christian Horner who is in a position to directly compare the newlycrowned twotime champion with fourtime champion Vettel gave a valid perspective on the two on Sunday night. They are two very different drivers two phenomenally successful drivers and I think what Sebastian has achieved in his career puts him among the greats and the most successful drivers in the sport he said on Sunday evening in Mexico. But I think Max what we are seeing today and this year we are actually witnessing something very special. I sometimes think that his achievements perhaps dont receive the plaudits that they should because what we have witnessed this year is an absolutely outstanding performance from a driver who is at the top of his game. Asked if Verstappens was the most impressive seasonlong performance from a driver Horner has seen he added Theres been years of domination with Mercedes but I think as an individual driver probably yes. He has won the most grands prix in a year now within 21 races. On top of that he has won two sprint races and he has not won all of them from pole position. Hes had to fight and race for a lot of those victories. When we look back at the end of the year it is an absolutely outstanding year that Max has driven. He hasnt put a wheel wrong. He has been perfect throughout the season and its incredible the level of consistency he has been able to achieve. Of course thats the opinion of a very proud team boss with a naturally biased viewpoint but even if Verstappen retired tomorrow it would be hard to deny his position among the top drivers in F1 history after this years performance. There will be some that point to Red Bulls breach of last years cost cap as a reason to diminish Verstappens achievement in 2022. But even the most exaggerated claims of how much performance Red Bull gained in the development of this years car by overspending last year would fall short of cancelling out his advantage over the rest of the field. Like him or not Verstappens performance this year has been truly exceptional.
Daniel Ricciardo calls for "maturity and respect" from Formula 1 paddock guests, https://www.planetf1.com/news/daniel-ricciardo-paddock-guests-respect/, After a number of drivers complained about the behaviour of some guests in the Mexican Grand Prix paddock Daniel Ricciardo has called for rules for those allowed into the inner circle. Pierre Gasly reported he felt mobbed by fans in the paddock and even had a stranger open his bag. I like having an atmosphere in the paddock I think it should be a fun place to be. Adults need to act like adults.Andreas Seidl warns against overreactionHowever Ricciardos team boss Andreas Seidl has warned against an overreaction. Im sure we will find solutions and we can keep enjoying this new atmosphere we have in the paddock throughout the world., After a number of drivers complained about the behaviour of some guests in the Mexican Grand Prix paddock Daniel Ricciardo has called for rules for those allowed into the inner circle. Formula 1 was racing at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez this past weekend Max Verstappen taking victory in what can only be described as an amphitheatre of excitement. Mexican fans are well known for the atmosphere they create but at times it was a bit too much. Pierre Gasly reported he felt mobbed by fans in the paddock and even had a stranger open his bag. Letting people in is fine but its true I feel like some guests sometimes are not really respecting the space we need he said. And people are coming into garages before qualifying and asking for pictures when they are not even from our team. We are working here and obviously we give time to the fans when we can. I know this weekend I didnt dare come out of the hospitality because otherwise you just know you will get mobbed. Sometimes it gets quite hectic because I arrived at the hospitality with my bag with my passport inside open and I didnt even feel it. Adults need to act like adults Ricciardos solution is for a set of guidelines to be written out and paddock guests to be made aware of the rules inside the paddock. While the Australian enjoys the atmosphere in the paddock he says there should be boundaries. To be honest this year has got more hectic he told The Race. I think there are two sides to it. The paddock used to lack atmosphere. I remember eight years ago 10 years ago the paddock was actually a pretty dull place. I like having an atmosphere in the paddock I think it should be a fun place to be. But there should also be boundaries. I think to be in the paddock and have a VIP pass its a privilege. And I think you also should act with some maturity and have respect. That hasnt always been shown this year. People lose their minds. If they set some guidelines maybe that helps because there isnt that at the moment. If its just a bit of awareness maybe they will be a little more cool. I dont want to see it change. Adults need to act like adults. Andreas Seidl warns against overreaction However Ricciardos team boss Andreas Seidl has warned against an overreaction. Formula 1 has often in the past been criticised for being out of reach for the fans the sport keeping its distance from the masses. Today under Liberty Media it is more accessible the owners trying to engage with fans wherever possible. The direction Formula 1 took is definitely the right one and a good one said the McLaren team principal. I appreciate a lot the atmosphere that is around now in the paddocks throughout the season. Here its clearly too extreme. And I think we just need to follow up and have a good discussion with Formula 1 how we can make sure that especially in countries like here in Mexico where the fans are also passionate for what we are doing and so enthusiastic we just always keep the right level of respect. Im sure we will find solutions and we can keep enjoying this new atmosphere we have in the paddock throughout the world.

He gets robbed comes back his next years car is rubbish Hamilton doesnt win a race all year and then finally comes back at a track where he could win the first race all year battling the same guy who won the race he was robbed in the previous year and manages to finish ahead of him. What a script and a story that would have been. But thats not the way the script turned out was it Because the guy that beat him after being robbed actually overtook him because hes got a quicker car because of engineering and Formula One and design and pretty much because of Adrian Newey Red Bulls chief technical officer over there. This was not the first time the British reporter had made his strong feelings on the 2021 season finale known. Ted Kravitz of Sky F1 conducts an interview. Getty Verstappen explained that his decision proved he would no longer tolerate Kravitzs invalidation of his world championship. It had nothing to do this weekend he said. But this year its been a constant Yeah kind of like daily being disrespectful especially one particular person. And its enough I dont accept it. You cant live in the past. You just have to move on.

I generally had a really good session today., Daniel Ricciardo secured his best qualifying result in five races but narrowly missed out on an appearance in the third qualifying session for topten drivers at the Mexican Grand Prix. It comes after the Australian opened up on the most challenging year ahead of qualifying. In an incredibly close and dramatic session Ricciardo made it out of Q1 for the first time in five races only to be dumped out as the 11thfastest driver in Q2 by just 0.053s. At the top end of the Q2 standings the top four were seperated by just 14 thousandths of a second  one of the tightest qualifying sessions in F1 history.

New to Kayo Start your free trial now  But Max Verstappen already confirmed as the World Champion this season soared to pole ahead of the Mercedes duo George Russell and Lewis Hamilton. His 1m 17.775s left Russell second by 0.304s  after he had his final run rubbed off for exceeding track limits  and Hamilton a marginal 0.005s off in P3. Verstappen took control on his first run in Q3 and then trimmed his time to resist the threat from the muchimproved Mercedes team. He will be hunting a record 14th win in a single season on Sunday. That was a good qualifying the Dutchman said. It was a close one but we made a few adjustments to the car and got into a better rhythm so to be on pole here is of course amazing. Its a very long run down to Turn One here so we need a good start but I think we have a quick car and thats what is most important. The passion of the fans here is really incredible and in the stadium it is just amazing to drive there. Sergio Perez was fourth in the other Red Bull for his home Grand Prix. Ricciardo finished the third and final practice session in P14 the same result as the second practice session as the Australians struggles at McLaren continued. But he found pace in qualifying and will be disappointed not to have reached Q3 as one of the top 10 drivers. Audi get partner for 2026 F1 play  0027 It has been a tough year for Ricciardo who admitted in an interview with The Daily Mail ahead of this weeks race that he was not his normal bubbly self as results slipped. My confidence was being eaten away driving a car that wouldnt dance with me and would bite back Ricciardo said. Whenever we thought we found a solution along would come another set of challenges. When you put so much into something and it doesnt work out there is sadness. It gets to you. Last year it affected me a little bit too much. I wouldnt be my usual bubbly self. I would be reluctant if someone said lets go out for dinner. I would need some cajoling. I let it get to me. I started to speak to a psychologist last year the most challenging year I have had. Ricciardo will have a fresh start next year with the Australian expected to take up a reserve driver role either at Mercedes or Red Bull. It comes after McLarens decision to axe Ricciardo earlier this year something which the 33yearold admits came as a surprise. It is fair to say it was unexpected given I was on a threeyear deal that had a year to run he said. It is not something you can prepare for. But Id already had some honest discussions with Andreas Seidel team principal and Zak Brown chief executive earlier in the year to see what we could do to improve things. It was a concern on both sides. Qualifying disappointment for Ricciardo  0124 In other news having set the pace with a leading time of 1.19.970 Mercedes George Russell is hoping he and teammate Lewis Hamilton can continue their success in qualifying. Id like to think its definitely a podium thats possible at least. Its probably one of if not our best Friday of the year Russell told the Formula 1s official website when asked of his expectations for the weekend. Between the two of us Russell and team mate Lewis Hamilton weve got 14 podiums so far this season so thats absolutely what well be going for. But not having the normal FP2 running where you get to understand the long run the consecutive laps of your rivals its going to be difficult to know. Hamilton finished the day in fourth and having settled for second place at the United States Grand Prix he too is also keen to potentially shoot for top spot this weekend. I feel good I feel really really good he said. I generally had a really good session today. I really enjoyed driving around the track. The car is feeling better and better as we work more through it and we understand it more. George Russell is pretty confident. Photo by Jared C. TiltonGetty Images Source Getty Images The second practice session was red flagged twice after Charles Leclerc ran into trouble with a heavy crash seeing his car left damaged at the rearend. Leclerc though did not seem too worried about the damage impacting his chances ahead of qualifying and Monday mornings race. I dont think any of it will compromise us he said. I think we have enough parts now with all the penalties weve had in the past so it should be fine. Follow all the action with the live blog below Cant see it Click here

The 25yearolds 14th victory of the season sees him pass Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel for the most race wins in a single season in Formula One history. Earlier in October Verstappen claimed his second career world championship at the Japanese Grand Prix and last week he won the US Grand Prix in Austin Texas which saw him share the record for number of season race wins. With his victory in Mexico Verstappen also broke the record for the most points accumulated in a single season previously set by Lewis Hamilton in 2019. The records confirm Verstappens dominance this season. After an inauspicious start in Bahrain back in March he has won race after race comfortably seeing off an early challenge from Ferraris Charles Leclerc. Speaking after Sundays race at Autodromo Hermanos Rodrguez in Mexico City Mexico Verstappen looked forward to more success. An incredible result. Its been an incredible year so far. Were definitely enjoying it and well try to go for more the Dutch driver said. Seventime world champion Lewis Hamilton finished in second place some 15 seconds behind the Dutchman and Red Bulls Sergio Perez came in third. Max Verstappen celebrates his 14th victory of the season. Chris GraythenGetty Images Verstappen started on pole and glided away while Hamilton behind him overtook teammate George Russell. The two teams began on different tires  Mercedes on the mediums in the hope of challenging the Dutchmans dominance with Red Bull on the softs  and for a while the cars were evenly matched. Red Bull pitted their drivers first opting for medium tires while Hamilton fitted hard tires so that he would not have to pit again. Ultimately Mercedes strategy did not pay off as Hamilton could only watch Verstappen increase his lead and team boss Toto Wolff later acknowledged over the radio that it was maybe not the right tire choice according to the BBC. But for all of Verstappen and Red Bulls achievements this year there was a shadow cast over the team on Sunday after it was sanctioned for a budget cap breach last year. Red Bull Racing RBR and the FIA agreed an Accepted Breach Agreement ABA for the teams breaking of F1s cost cap rules in 2021 the sports governing body announced on Friday. RBR were found to have breached the cost cap by 432652 501409. Max Verstappen has now won eight of the last nine F1 races. Chris GraythenGetty Images The punishment amounts to a fine of 7 million a 10 reduction in cost limits for RBRs aerodynamic testing for next year and responsibility for the costs incurred by the Cost Cap Administration who were responsible for investigating the breach. In the FIA statement the Cost Cap Administration noted that RBR acted cooperatively throughout the review process and that there is no accusation or evidence that RBR has sought at any time to act in bad faith. The more draconian part is the sporting penalty which is a 10 reduction on our ability to utilise our wind tunnel and aerodynamic tools team boss Christian Horner said in a press conference according to ESPN. That represents anywhere between 0.25 seconds and 0.5 seconds of lap time. That comes in from now it has a direct effect on next years car and it will be in place for a 12month period. Two races remain on the F1 calendar for Verstappen to add to his record tally with the Brazilian Grand Prix scheduled on November 13 and the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on November 20.

Dan IstiteneFormula 1Getty Images What is F1 and how is it different from IndyCar Both IndyCar and F1 are openwheeled singleseater racing formats. This means that the cars can only fit one person and have uncovered wheels that protrude from the body of the vehicle. Despite their basic similarities F1 and IndyCar offer very different experiences. In F1 there are only 10 teams with two drivers apiece for a total of 20 drivers. Most races must go for 305 km which is about 190 miles. Each driver needs to use two different tires in the race so a pit stop is mandatory though cars are not allowed to refuel. Races average around two hours in length and are held at venues all over the world. Teams spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year developing their cars. All cars must have certain elements  for example gearboxes must have eight gears plus a reverse and last for six consecutive races  but teams have leeway to tweak and change some parts of their car including their engines in the pursuit of speed. In contrast the cars featured in IndyCar are more standardized. They all have the same aerodynamic kit and chassis and can only be powered by one of two engines  either a Honda or a Chevrolet. That said teams are allowed to develop some of their own parts like dampers and some of their suspensions. IndyCar races occur on a wide range of tracks from fast ovals to road and street courses. The length of the races also varies with some like the Indianapolis 500 lasting 500 laps and taking over three hours to complete. Not surprisingly refueling during pit stops is a big part of the strategy during IndyCar races. Teams can field more than two cars meaning that the amount of drivers on the grid fluctuates from race to race. IndyCar is mostly considered an American sport and does not have the same level of money and glamour associated with it compared to the globehopping F1 circuit. Why should I care about F1 F1 races might best be described as a sort of actionpacked chess match that takes place while drivers are throttling around a track at close to 200 mph. Teams need both strategy and skill to compete against some of the best minds in motorsports. F1 is also full of strong personalities. The Netflix documentary series F1 Drive to Survive follows many of the teams and drivers over the course of a year and has helped raise the profile of the sport in the US. Released in March season four of the series chronicles last years tight championship race between rivals Verstappen and Hamilton. It also focuses on the internal battles between drivers on the same team while giving viewers a peek into the tense pressurized world of elite racing.

Mercedes have endured a hugelydisappointing campaign following the introduction of new design regulations and saw their eightyear streak of constructors championships officially ended on Sunday as Red Bull added the title to Max Verstappens second successive drivers crown. After an encouraging display in Austin whether or not Mercedes can win one of the final three races  starting in Mexico this weekend  has been a hot topic of discussion but the seventime world champion is not confident. Hamilton pointed to the fact that his strong race performance was aided by being boosted to third on the grid because of penalties for Ferraris Charles Leclerc and Red Bulls Sergio Perez. I think we really need to be realistic Hamilton said. The Red Bull car has been the fastest car by far all year and it is still the fastest car.

Hamilton is aiming to break the tie with Michael Schumacher in his 16th campaign this year. His hopes of victory in Austin were further boosted when Verstappen was held stationary for 11 seconds during his second and final pit stop which saw the Red Bull driver drop around seven seconds behind the Brit with Leclerc also between them.

The porpoising the breaking the floors because they were hitting the ground and to figure that out during the year when you also have very limited testing was super difficult. Also to do it within the budget cap such a big challenge and theyve really made great progress.

The Constructors Cup was clinched by Verstappens Red Bull Racing team at Circuit of the Americas outside Austin Texas this past weekend. Now comes Sundays Mexican Grand Prix and it seems theres not much left to race for except bragging rights. Well actually theres a lot left to race for at Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez such as can Charles Leclerc and Ferrari salvage some pride and finish second in the driver standings or can Sergio Perez make it a Red Bull 12 on the season. Perez is out to become the first home driver to win the Mexican Grand Prix while his illustrious teammate is also in search of his 14th win on the season which no F1 driver has ever accomplished Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel hold the record at 13. Obviously a win at his home Grand Prix would go a long way for Perez  known as Checo to his friends and fans  clinching the first runnerup position to Verstappen. Leclerc currently holds a twopoint advantage on Perez. And while it is a case of too little too late the upgrades Mercedes unleashed at the COTA made them very racy indeed so expect Lewis Hamilton and teammate George Russell to not go quietly into the night in these final three races of the calendar.

It is by far the highest elevation the F1 circus will compete at on the 2022 calendar year Interlagos Brazil is the next highest at 4921 feet and as can be imagined the thin air causes issues for not just the drivers but also the cars. It should be a track the Ferraris excel at considering the thinner air means that cars carrying more downforce will suffer less of a penalty and cars with a horsepower advantage may find it harder to breath in that thin air. The signature feature of the track is Turn 17 the Peraltada a banked extremely fast corner that brings the field back to the extremely long front straight. This is also the second of the two DRS zones on the track setting up for dragrace finishes to Turn 1. The first DRS zone is at the exit of the Turn 11 chicane to Turn 12 which is very short. Strategies in the past have seen a onestopper be the winning formula with cars starting on the hardest compound being good 50 laps or more then switching to a softer compound for the sprint to the finish. Whether that compound will be the intermediate or the super soft remains to be discovered by the teams during open practices on Friday and Saturday ahead of Saturdays qualifying. Past races has seen the intermediate last up to 30 laps so that would mean a pit window strategy somewhere in the 20s with the hard compounds then being slipped on for the remainder of the scheduled 71 laps. Or do you go with the super softs hope to get at least 20 laps then go to the hard compounds Red Bull Racing has proven to be adept at saving its tires most likely due to the fact that the cars seem to be running far less downforce than Ferrari and other challengers so perhaps this will be the roll of the dice team principal Christian Horner takes at Mexico City.

The team publicly displayed a new wing for the W13 at the United States GP as part of a wider upgrade package but didnt run the wing detail all weekend. But Mercedes Formula 1 technical director Mike Elliott said it was always the plan to not run the wing as the team didnt have enough copies of it for both drivers to run the update. Mercedes says the fasteners on the wing are there to keep it together while the counterargument is that their distribution is deliberate for aerodynamic gain. Gary Anderson Mercedes wing upgrade exploits a grey area Read moreThat is our last major update but there are always a string of new parts smaller parts that we are looking at Shovlin added., Mercedes is planning to race with a new front wing on its 2022 Formula 1 car at the Mexico Grand Prix  a wing which raised eyebrows when first revealed in Austin last weekend. The team publicly displayed a new wing for the W13 at the United States GP as part of a wider upgrade package but didnt run the wing detail all weekend. This followed question marks being raised over the legality of the specially shaped fasteners between the two upper flaps that led to an exchange with the FIA. But Mercedes Formula 1 technical director Mike Elliott said it was always the plan to not run the wing as the team didnt have enough copies of it for both drivers to run the update. Mercedes Arguing new wing detail probably not worth the risk Read more Elliott said he was unsure whether Mercedes would run the new front wing detail during the three remaining races in 2022 because of the risk of it being found illegal when it only provides a marginal performance improvement. Personally I think we could argue them Elliott said in Austin. But the question becomes whether we want to or not. The gain for those bits is so small is it worth the risk of falling foul of the stewards The legality question marks centre around what the primary purpose of the design is. Mercedes says the fasteners on the wing are there to keep it together while the counterargument is that their distribution is deliberate for aerodynamic gain. The reason we didnt run it in Austin was that we only had one of those parts trackside engineering director Andrew Shovlin said in the teams regular race debrief YouTube video. Mercedes front wing may need tweaking after FIA exchange Read more So if we damaged it during qualifying it would have meant the car that damaged the wing had to start from the back. Also with a very busy programme we had the tyre test in FP2 we didnt actually have time to evaluate. We have more of those parts available in Mexico we will run that on the Friday well check its all working as expected and the plan at this stage is to race that wing. Shovlin confirmed that while Austins upgrade marked the final major development of the season the team will still make changes to the W13 during the final three races. Gary Anderson Mercedes wing upgrade exploits a grey area Read more That is our last major update but there are always a string of new parts smaller parts that we are looking at Shovlin added. Either to get a small gain in performance or at a lot of it as this stage of the year though is learning for next year so some of those test parts are really just trying to understand some of the development direction we want to go in. So like I said its the last major update but it wont be the last change to the car. As well as attempting to gather data for when it  according to team boss Toto Wolff  changes the DNA of its car next year Mercedes is also trying to save itself from its first winless F1 season since 2011.

Audi to enter Formula 1 with Sauber, https://www.speedcafe.com/2022/10/26/audi-to-enter-formula-1-with-sauber/, Audi has confirmed that it will partner with Sauber when it enters Formula 1 in 2026. It has entered a strategic partnership with Sauber with plans to acquire a stake in its parent company Sauber Group a deal which will see the squad compete as the Audi factory team from 2026. It is great news to hear that Audi will have a partnership with Sauber for their entry into Formula 1 in 2026 said Formula 1 CEO Stefano Domenicali. Formula 1 will simplify the current power unit regulations by eliminating the MGUH while increasing the emphasis on electrification and introducing sustainable fuels. Sauber entered Formula 1 in 1993 with support from Mercedes and in the mid2000s became the BMW factory team., Audi has confirmed that it will partner with Sauber when it enters Formula 1 in 2026. The news was widely expected after the German marque announced in August its intention to join the grid as a power unit supplier. It has entered a strategic partnership with Sauber with plans to acquire a stake in its parent company Sauber Group a deal which will see the squad compete as the Audi factory team from 2026. We are delighted to have gained such an experienced and competent partner for our ambitious Formula 1 project said Oliver Hoffmann Audi AG Board Member and Responsible for F1 Programme. We already know the Sauber Group with its stateoftheart facility and experienced team from previous collaborations and are convinced that together we will form a strong team. Finn Rausing Chairman of Sauber Holding added Audi is the best partner for the Sauber Group. It is clear that both companies share the same values and vision. We are looking forward to achieving our common goals with a strong and successful partnership. The addition of Audi in a factory capacity will see it join the likes of Mercedes Ferrari McLaren Aston Martin and Alpine Renault who already have a constructors presence on the grid. It is great news to hear that Audi will have a partnership with Sauber for their entry into Formula 1 in 2026 said Formula 1 CEO Stefano Domenicali. The combination of those two names is a very exciting prospect for our sport. It highlights the strong momentum that Formula 1 has and the belief in our strategy to further grow and enhance the sport while delivering on our sustainability plans to be Net Zero Carbon by 2030 with advanced sustainable fuels in the cars in 2026. We look forward to seeing their progress over the coming years and the car on the grid for the teams first race. The Hinwilbased operation will continue competing with its supply of Ferrari power units until the next generation of regulations are introduced in 2026. Formula 1 will simplify the current power unit regulations by eliminating the MGUH while increasing the emphasis on electrification and introducing sustainable fuels. The rules have been designed in an attempt to lure new manufacturers into the sport. And it has already worked as demonstrated by Audis commitment. Already there are limitations on the scale of the development which can be employed especially surrounding test bench hours. A manufacturer looking to homologate a power unit for use in Formula 1 must adhere to those regulations else its submission will be rejected. That means the likes of Audi cannot simply throw unlimited resources at its project before then formally joining the sport in 2026. Sauber entered Formula 1 in 1993 with support from Mercedes and in the mid2000s became the BMW factory team. More recently it has operated under the Alfa Romeo banner a naming rights deal for the Swiss operation.
How F1 Painted Itself into a Corner with Cost Cap Regulations, https://www.autoweek.com/racing/formula-1/a41766368/f1-painted-itself-corner-cost-cap-regulations/, Red Bull isnt the only one on sweating out the ultimate penalties handed down for the teams 2021 cost cap breach. And then go What should we do to modify it moving forward But fundamentally the cost cap is a very important part of Formula 1s future. They might as well not have a cost cap in the future. One possible outcome is a cost cap penalty that lowers Red Bulls cost cap for futures years that would force Red Bull to work under a tighter budget than the other teams. 9.3 At its sole discretion the Cost Cap Adjudication Panel may suspend the application of any imposed sanction in whole or in part., The FIA has already announced that Red Bull was in breach of the 145 million cap for 2021. The Formula 1 series spells out its financial regulations in a 54page document that also lists expenses that ARENT even included in the cap. According F1s regulations the penalty for a breach could range anywhere from a public reprimand to a disqualification from the season in question. While the Formula 1 paddock and F1 fans around the world wait patiently for F1s decision for a penalty in the case of Red Bull Racings cost cap breach its worth noting that the governing body has plenty of tools in its toolbox. The FIA has already announced that Red Bull was in breach of the 145 million cap for 2021. Reports from media in Europe say the breach was about 1.8 million. No big deal you say If thats your stance what IS a big deal Would 5 million get your attention or 10 million Formula 1 spells out its financial regulations in a 54page yep 54 pages document that lists expenses that ARENT even included in the cap. That list see below is likely longer than the list of items that ARE included in the cap. It also reads in a format that only an accountant can truly appreciate. And no teams are not spending only 145 million on their F1 program. Its clearly a lot more than that driver salaries salaries of three highestpaid employees on the team and engine developmentthree large line items for most teamsare not even included. Red Bull isnt the only one on sweating out the ultimate penalties handed down for the teams 2021 cost cap breach. Mark Thompson Getty Images That said Red Bulls breach puts the FIA and Formula 1 in a tough some say impossible position. Red Bulls rivals who say theyre playing by the rules want a tough penaltyone that will get everyones attention and to discourage further breaches. Well its a new process Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said this past weekend in Austin Texas. What you have to remember with these regulations is that they were introduced at a level of 175 million. It was then reduced by 30 million during the pandemic to make the final number 145 million. Its a complicated set of regulations. Its 52 pages actually its 54 and of course weve been through that process and 2021 was the firstever year of a set of very complicated financial regulations which of course have varying interpretations to them from different accounting specialists. So obviously the findings of the FIA have been made public recently. And were now in a voluntary process with the FIA going through that process with them. And I hope you will be able to conclude it in the near future. But thats where we currently are. McLarens Zak Brown Jared C. Tilton Getty Images McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown has been a leading proponent calling for harsh penalties. Come down hard or run the risk of teams losing incentive to stick to the rules. After all whats a 10 million fine to a team like Red Bull one that has been known to spend more than 350 million on an F1 season. I think the budget cap is very important for the future of the sport. I think everybody recognizes that and thats why it was put in place. It is complicated it is new. I think none of us know any details. So I think we need to wait for the FIA and Red Bull to finish up the process that theyre in. And I think just even like on the Super License it was a shame not to get Colton Herta into the sport. I think he too would have been an excellent addition to the grid. And I think with this being a new process what we need to do is come out of the backside of this and learn from it and see what we need to doas we need to do with other regulationsmodify them from time to time. I think we all have opinions but we need to kind of see it through and thenas the teams the FIA and Formula 1 dosit around a table and say this probably isnt perfect. I dont think anyone thought it would be perfect. And then go What should we do to modify it moving forward But fundamentally the cost cap is a very important part of Formula 1s future. So the ball is in the FIAs court. According to its own rules the penalty could range anywhere from a public reprimand to a disqualification from the season in question. In other words yes the FIA could take Max Verstappens 2021 title away and give it to Lewis Hamilton. Verstappens 8point championship margin wouldnt hold up to a 50point penalty. Ive heard the things that have been said said Hamilton who might stand to be the biggest winner in all of this. Im generally looking forwards. Im looking at how I can win another championship. I have my own opinions of what we did as a team and how we did it last year. And Im really proud of that. And belief in what we earned. It doesnt really change a huge amount. I do think that sport needs to do something about this in the future. Otherwise if its quite relaxed if they relax with these rules then all the teams would just go over spending millions more and then only having a slap on the wristits obviously not going to be great for the sport. They might as well not have a cost cap in the future. That might be the very penalty that Alfa Romeo team principal Frederic Vasseur would like to see. Financial penalties he believes would be little more than a slap on the wrist to the bigger teams. The FIA confirmed Red Bull was in breach for the 2021 season more than two weeks ago yet still has not announced a penalty resolution. For sure at the end the sooner the better but the most important for me is to have the good level of penalty Vasseur said. Its not because we are in a rush that we have to do something like this and to take any decision. This is crucial for the F1 for the future for the cost cap and now its into the hands of the FIA to find the right level of punishment. But for me it has to be a sporting punishment because at the end its a sporting infringement. We are not speaking about financial we are speaking about car updates and at the end we have to find the right level of punishment. What Can Red Bull Expect Its likely that the probable outcome will land somewhere closer to public reprimand than an outright disqualification or points deduction that costs Verstappen his 2021 championship. One possible outcome is a cost cap penalty that lowers Red Bulls cost cap for futures years that would force Red Bull to work under a tighter budget than the other teams. Another possible penalty could be a limit to valuable wind tunnel testing. The FIA and F1 are clearly in a tough position that they likely didnt expect to be in during the first year of the cost cap. At the very least the 54page F1 Financial Regulations could have devoted a few more pages toward the penalty phase and spell out the penalties in much clearer and more precise language. The FIA and F1 have painted themselves into a corner. And its going to be tough for anyone to come out of this one looking good. Red Bulls Christian Horner left Max Verstappen center and engineer Adrian Newey.

Toto Wolff has Audi "on his radar" for 2026 Formula 1 success, https://www.planetf1.com/news/toto-wolff-audi-radar-2026-success/, Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff has said he is wary of Audis competitiveness right from the moment they will enter Formula 1 in 2026. Formal confirmation of that deal has now come with Sauber operating as Audis official factory entry from 2026 onwards. I would never underestimate the VW Group parent company of Audi said Wolff quoted by MotorsportTotal. However their entry in 2026 will rekindle a MercedesAuto Union rivalry that dates back to preWorld War II grand prix racing. It is great news to hear Audi will have a partnership with Sauber for their entry into Formula 1 in 2026 he said., Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff has said he is wary of Audis competitiveness right from the moment they will enter Formula 1 in 2026. Having previously announced their intent to arrive in Formula 1 in 2026 the nature of Audis entry has now been made clear as the German manufacturer revealed a partnership with Sauber Motorsport  the team currently operating the Alfa Romeo F1 entry. The same day Audi announced their F1 entry Alfa Romeo confirmed their partnership with Sauber would come to a close at the end of 2023  leaving little doubt Audi and Sauber were set to pair up. Formal confirmation of that deal has now come with Sauber operating as Audis official factory entry from 2026 onwards. They will continue as Alfa Romeo until the end of next year before reverting to Sauber with Ferrari power units until the end of 2025. Toto Wolff wont underestimate the VW Group Wolff who also heads up Mercedes motorsport programme has earmarked Audi to do well and hit the ground running in 2026  even if the task ahead looks huge. I would never underestimate the VW Group parent company of Audi said Wolff quoted by MotorsportTotal. I have them absolutely on the radar. They are one of the teams that could be successful in 2026. Audi and Mercedes are longtime rivals on the domestic front due to their battles in the DTM series but Audi have never competed in the Formula 1 World Championship. However their entry in 2026 will rekindle a MercedesAuto Union rivalry that dates back to preWorld War II grand prix racing. While that historic rivalry has no relevance to modernday motorsport Wolff said the overall expertise of the Volkswagen Group will enable Audi to flourish as he highlighted the financial strength knowhow and motorsport expertise to get a great project off the ground and I think the marriage with Sauber is one that fits. Wolff also pointed out the legal framework in Hinwil a Germanspeaking region of Switzerland is similar to that in Germany  which means a cultural clash is unlikely to occur between the two parties. F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali thrilled by Audis arrival Formula 1 CEO Stefano Domenicali also welcomed the news of Audis arrival saying it is an exciting prospect for F1 as a new prominent manufacturer signs up to race. It is great news to hear Audi will have a partnership with Sauber for their entry into Formula 1 in 2026 he said. The combination of those two names is a very exciting prospect for our sport. It highlights the strong momentum Formula 1 has and the belief in our strategy to further grow and enhance the sport while delivering on our sustainability plans to be Net Zero Carbon by 2030 with advanced sustainable fuels in the cars in 2026. We look forward to seeing their progress over the coming years and the car on the grid for the teams first race. Read More Sauber to compete as Audi factory team from 2026 as partnership confirmed

Hamilton interview: New F1 deal on despite fresh ‘kick’ over 2021 title loss, https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/hamilton-interview-new-f1-deal-on-despite-fresh-kick-over-2021-title-loss/10390799/, Reflecting on his emotions in the wake of Abu Dhabi as he disconnected from the public spotlight he plays down talk that he came close to walking away. I think Ive learned just not to get my hopes up with anything. I would say more I would definitely think Ive been better than I was in the other times Ive had years like this. I think Ive been a better teammate to my colleagues than I have ever before. And I think outside in my outside life I think Ive had an even better balance than Ive had in the past., But despite the lows of last years Abu Dhabi controversy the competitive struggles with Mercedes this season and renewed angst caused by Red Bulls cost cap overspend the seventime champion is clear that his passion for racing has not cooled. In fact despite having many good reasons to walk away from F1 and go pursue interests he has elsewhere the desire to stick with his current team is stronger than ever. There is no if about a contract extension with Mercedes beyond the end of 2023. Its only a question of when. We are going to do another deal he tells selected media including Autosport in an interview at last weekends United States Grand Prix. Were going to sit down and were going to discuss it in these next couple of months I would say. My goal is to continue to be with Mercedes. Ive been with Mercedes since I was 13. And it really is my family MercedesBenz is my family. Theyve stuck with me through thick and thin. They stuck with me through being expelled at school. They stuck with me through everything that was going on through 2020. Theyve stuck with me through my mistakes and shit thats been in the press theyve stuck with me through the ups and downs. I really believe in this brand. I believe in the people that are within the organisation. And I want to be the best teammate I can be to them because I think we can make the brand even better more accessible even stronger than it is. And I think I can be an integral part of that. Abu Dhabi fallout While Hamilton is enthusiastic about his future with Mercedes in F1 its fair to say that the turbulence he has endured since that controversial safety car restart in Abu Dhabi last year has not been easy to navigate through. Reflecting on his emotions in the wake of Abu Dhabi as he disconnected from the public spotlight he plays down talk that he came close to walking away. It feels like years ago he said. I mean it was definitely spiritbreaking or soulcrushing whatever you want to call it. Was I ever truly not going to come back I am not one to give up like that really. However while quitting was never on the table thats not to say that the pain of the Abu Dhabi loss  and especially the circumstances of the FIA bending its own rules  did not cut deep. What really was breaking was to just believe that the sport would do something like that that that would happen in the sport given that there are so many people who you rely on he said. You expect that the job would be done right. And an outcome of a world championship which so many people have worked so hard for would come out through a wrong decision from somebody you know That was probably the only thing. It wasnt for my lack of love for working with my team or racing cars it was literally that...if you can lose a championship through wrongdoing within an organisation that was the thing that I wondered about. But I spent time with my family and that was really the best part of the healing really. I just gave all of my time to the kids building snowmen and just being present with them. That enabled me to really recover really bounce back. If I wasnt with them I would have been stuck in a hole. Asked if he felt the decisions made by F1 race director Michael Masi in Abu Dhabi were deliberate to try to stop him winning an eighth crown Hamilton responds I dont know. It feels so long ago now. I think it was just bad decisionmaking. Im sure there is ego involved and then there are also the moving parts. Theres people speaking into his ear. I dont feel like it was particularly targeted. Cost cap kick Lewis Hamilton Mercedes W12 Max Verstappen Red Bull Racing RB16B Photo by Sam Bloxham  Motorsport Images While the Abu Dhabi controversy still remains a sensitive topic within F1 and Mercedes boss Toto Wolff admitted that he still thinks about the events every single day Hamilton has deliberately tried to draw a line under it. Ive moved on from it. I refuse to live in the past. I have already experienced that in 2007 and as a youngster that definitely kept me up at nights and it was just negative. When you hold on to some negativity when you hold on to hate or whatever it is it is just holding you back. Im going up. And I am going forwards regardless of whats happened in the past. I chose not to dwell on it. There is nothing I can do about back then. I gave everything. Like I gave everything and I sacrificed. But I am willing to do it again. So thats what Im trying to work towards. But even Hamiltons mindset in trying to erase the negativity of Abu Dhabi has been tested recently when it emerged that Red Bull had been found guilty by the FIA of overspending during its 2021 campaign. Having himself spoken in public recently about the impact extra development money for Mercedes would have had on the title battle it is clear that the ghosts of 2021 may never go away completely. Definitely when you heard going into Singapore about this cost cap thing that for sure brings up a little bit of emotion he admits. Because you kind of buried it and moved on and then it comes back up and then its like another bit of a kick. And yeah that just bought it all kind of fresh again. So then just getting back into the phase of just suppressing it and moving forwards. Where the matter goes now is now something for the FIA to decide but even if there were the unlikely scenario of Red Bull and Max Verstappen losing championship points and the 2021 title because of the cost cap issue Hamilton says that would bring him zero satisfaction. No because the damage is done he said. I have my feeling within of what we did as a team how we achieved it and what we really truly achieved and I can keep that to myself within me. We gave it our all and we did it the right way and I am proud of that. Mercedes bouncing woes Lewis Hamilton Mercedes W13 Photo by Glenn Dunbar  Motorsport Images What has also perhaps made the Abu Dhabi controversy so much harder to forget is that Hamilton and Mercedes have not simply been able to dust themselves off and keep battling for the next title. The 2022 W13 car has proven to be a difficult car. It took Mercedes too long to understand its problems and against the backdrop of the cost cap era in F1 an inseason recovery has proved to be too much to deliver. It has meant a campaign unlike any other they have experienced together. And while there have been positives to take from the learning experience it has certainly not been entirely fun to live through. Hamilton says the realisation back in winter testing that things had not gone right was especially tough on everyone at Brackley. I wouldnt say its been perfect for anyone he explained. Im sure Toto would tell you its not been perfect for him. We sat in February and we were all upbeat. They were all telling us we were going to have a massive quick car and Im sure everyone who was working on it was so hyped with all the hard work they put in through the winter. Its such a gruelling time for everyone in the team thats when they really crunch and put in the crazy hours. In normal life you expect that period to be a more relaxed time for people. But to then find out the damn thing doesnt work and weve got bouncing that was hard for everybody. Everyone was really struggling I think. And we all went through our own process of how to deal with it. But I think surprisingly its been a really powerful transformational time for us all. Weve got stronger and tighter as a team. But how tough was the mental readjustment for Hamilton himself I think from the initial phase at the beginning it didnt feel too difficult he reflects. But definitely it started to wear down on you because youre in the hope that youre going to get back there and we didnt for a while. Then all of a sudden we start having those races where we get into second and then the next race its not. The car is one weekend good then its one two three four not good then it pops up. And you dont know. You do all the work in the simulator and the simulators telling you something different to what you get at the track. Just a confusing overall year of emotions. You think the car feels quite good this weekend or the engineers say ok weve got an upgrade thats worth three tenths and you get there and its a tenth slower. And youre oh shoot. I think Ive learned just not to get my hopes up with anything. Its better to kind of underexpect and if its just as good its just as good and if its better its better. In terms of preparation I think were better. In how he has responded himself to the challenge of not being out there battling for the win every weekend Hamilton thinks he has handled things better than he did in the past when things did not go right. Theres always value theres always things to take from the learnings he says about the year. Its not like Ive never experienced a season like this. I would say more I would definitely think Ive been better than I was in the other times Ive had years like this. Within the team within the messaging within geeing people up. I think Ive been a better teammate to my colleagues than I have ever before. And I think outside in my outside life I think Ive had an even better balance than Ive had in the past. I think its been OK. Looking to the future Lewis Hamilton MercedesAMG with Toto Wolff Team Principal and CEO Mercedes AMG Photo by Steve Etherington  Motorsport Images What has never been in doubt though is Hamiltons desire to get back to the front. This is still at the top of his todo list rather than going off to pursue something else. In terms of my plans for the future each year at the end of the year you sit there and youre looking over whatever view you have and youre sitting trying to figure out he says. I dont know how it is for you guys but Im trying to like analyse my year and analyse my next three to five year plan. Its difficult to do ten. But where do I see myself What are the things I want to do What are my goals And things are being added. And Im adding in lots of business things. I have a lot of business going on. I have a lot of successful really positive things that have lots of opportunity for success outside. But I want to keep racing. I love what I do. Ive been doing it for 30 years and I dont feel that I should have to stop. I think Im currently still earning my keep I would say. I want to do better still. But I am planning to be here longer.

It is Saubers second full works agreement after their linkup with BMW in the 2000s and owner Finn Rausing said Audi were the best strategic partner for the company. The goal now will be to return to at least the upper midfield. Sauber who first debuted in Formula 1 in 1993 partnered with Alfa Romeo in 2018 but have still been operating at a smaller budget than nearly all of their rivals and have been towards the back of the grid since. A linkup with Audi will certainly help their cause.

The new generation of F1 engines will feature increased electrical power and 100 per cent sustainable fuels.

Hamilton wants to put full focus into his new film and TV production company that he has launched when his racing career ends. The Mercedes drivers company Dawn Apollo Films already has two exciting projects ready to go and has been made with his manager Penni Thow. While Hamiltons involvement in motorsport is set to take a backseat during his retirement his two upcoming projects are both set on the track. The 37yearold will be an executive producer of an F1 film starring Brad Pitt while a documentary chronicling Hamiltons life and career is also expected to be released in late 2023 or early 2024 under his new companys name. Hamilton though has no interest in ending his pursuit for an eighth Drivers Championship title on the track in the near future. The Brit has endured a frustrating season without a race win and came up agonisingly short as he lost out to his rival Max Verstappen at the US Grand Prix on Sunday. But the man with the most race wins podium finishes and pole positions in F1 is familiar with struggles elite athletes face in retirement and has been keen to make sure he can put his energy into something completely new when he stops racing. Image Getty Images Getty Images Im very conscious of other great athletes who spend their whole lives as I have focused on their sport and when they come to the end they might not necessarily have had the right people around them to help structure the course ahead for them Hamilton told Deadline. Ive spoken to people who have said look when I stopped it all came crashing down I wasnt prepared to do other things I hadnt taken time to learn any other crafts other skills and I dont know what my other passions are so I didnt really focus on trying to understand what those are and create pillars. So when I stop racing  which I dont plan on doing for a while I still feel Im in a good place  I want it to be seamless. I want to be able to move on to fully focus on Dawn Apollo Films and to be able to jump in at a similar level to what Ive been used to.

Now though Fernando is dating Austrian TV presenter Andrea Schlager after going public on his social media accounts in May 2022. Unfortunately in a social media posting in January 2020 Bottas admitted that their marriage had come to an end. Sergio Perez wifeCheco has been with Carola Martinez since 2011 and the pair married in 2018 after previously having their first child together  Sergio Jr. With that in mind we are unlikely to see regular snaps of Carlos and his current girlfriend on social media anytime soon., GPFans Staff Tuesday 25 October 2022 0900  Updated 2124 F1 is one of the most glamorous sports in the world with the jetsetting lifestyle taking the drivers to every corner of the planet during the intense season. Being on the road means meeting the attention of many adoring fans which can be a dream  but only if youre single. There is huge interest in the wives and girlfriends of the drivers on the grid and when they are not driving around circuits at crazy speeds F1 stars can often be found posting pictures on Instagram of their movie star lifestyles with their current partners. Interest in their lives off track has also been heightened by exposure from the hit Netflix documentary series Drive To Survive which continues to grow the audience outside of the action between the cars. So who are the wives and girlfriends of the F1 stars Here is what we know now Does Lewis Hamilton have a girlfriend The celebrity status of Lewis Hamilton is now stratospheric even beyond the sport of Formula 1 and in the past he has been linked to a number of highprofile celebrities including singers Rita Ora Nicki Minaj and Rihanna as well as models Barbara Palvin Gigi Hagid Winnie Harlow and Sofia Richie. His longest and most famous fling was with singer Nicole Scherzinger who he dated on and off between 2007 and 2015. But in an interview at the beginning of 2021 Hamilton admitted to having a nonexistent romantic life and that his focus was on racing. That hasnt changed much of late and he has extended his interests into other areas including becoming increasingly interested in his personal carbon footprint as well as being involved in the purchase of his very own NFL franchise.

Verstappen is guarded over his personal life but we absolutely know that his girlfriend now is Brazilian model Kelly Piquet. Kelly is the daughter of threetime F1 world champion Nelson Piquet and she was previously in a relationship with another F1 driver Daniil Kyvat. Lando Norris girlfriend spilt Lando Norris caused a social media explosion and broke a few hearts too by confirming in early 2022 that he was dating Portuguese model Luisinha Oliveira. Later in 2022 Norris also revealed some of the online hate and death threats the pair have received underlining the negative side of fame which is often forgotten. But Norris has since confirmed that he and Oliveira had split following claims he had attempted to contact another model online. In a series of leaked Instagram posts he was shown asking a Dutch model that he had met at the Zandvoort Grand Prix the year prior if she wanted to join him for a McDonalds. After the messages were released Norris announced that he and Oliveira had had an amicable split. At the time of writing Norris is single. Does Daniel Ricciardo have a girlfriend It seems the Australians charm stretches beyond the boundaries of F1 as he has been linked to a handful of stunning women in recent years following the end of his longterm relationship with childhood sweetheart Jemma Boskovich in 2016. He was rumoured at one time to be dating Red Bull colleague Annemarie Horbass who worked with an event management company associated with the team. More recently Ricciardo has been said to be involved with model and fellow Perth native Jessica Gomes and regularly linked with Heidi Berger daughter of former F1 star Gerhard Berger. Charles Leclerc girlfriend Charles Leclercs exgirlfriend model Giada Gianni was with the Ferrari driver for a number of years and there were rumours of an engagement in the works. But the pair broke things off at the end of 2019 and since Leclerc has found a new partner. Fellow Monegasque resident Charlotte Sine has been with Leclerc since the end of the 2019 season. She is an architect student and owns a custom shoe business. Fernando Alonso girlfriend Alonso was married to Spanish singer Raquel del Rosario between 2006 and 2011 and after that was long linked to Italian model and TV personality Linda Morselli. Now though Fernando is dating Austrian TV presenter Andrea Schlager after going public on his social media accounts in May 2022. Sebastian Vettel wife Notoriously private about his life away from F1 Vettel has been in a longterm relationship with childhood friendturnedgirlfriendturnedwife Hanna Prater. The pair have two children  Emilie and Matilda  and married in early 2019. Valtteri Bottas girlfriend For nearly a decade Bottas was involved with Olympic Swimmer and fellow Finn Emilia Pikkarainen. After dating from 2010 she became his wife when they married in August 2016 in Helsinki. Unfortunately in a social media posting in January 2020 Bottas admitted that their marriage had come to an end. Now Valtteri is dating Australian cycling star Tiffany Cromwell and it was she who took that now infamous Bottas bum picture in May 2022. Sergio Perez wife Checo has been with Carola Martinez since 2011 and the pair married in 2018 after previously having their first child together  Sergio Jr. Since then they have also welcomed a daughter Carlota and a second son Emilio. Perez is relatively private about his life away from F1 but Carola regularly posts pictures of the family together on her Instagram. Lance Stroll girlfriend Not only does Stroll have a burgeoning F1 career but his dad Lawrence is a billionaire making him a fairly eligible bachelor. He has been linked in the past to designer TV presenter and socialite Kimberley Garner but Stroll is now dating Italian model Sara Pagliaroli who also has her own jewellery brand Blue Lemon. Pierre Gasly girlfriend Pierre Gasly dated Italian aerospace engineer Caterina Masetti Zannini from 2018 but the pair later split. More recently the French AlphaTauri star has been seen out with Ukrainian model and social media influencer Katerina Berezhna though they too have reportedly now gone their separate ways. Carlos Sainz girlfriend In 2021 Sainz was romantically linked with former journalism student and current PR Isabel Hernaez but the Spanish Ferrari ace is notoriously protective about his life away from the track. With that in mind we are unlikely to see regular snaps of Carlos and his current girlfriend on social media anytime soon.

Previously Russell had dated Seychelle De Vries the sister of Mercedes F1 test driver Nyck de Vries. Mick Schumacher girlfriend Schumacher the son of F1 great Michael and now making his own impact on the sport with Haas is motor racing royalty.

Mercedes to change F1 car architecture for 2023 says Wolff, https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/mercedes-to-change-f1-car-architecture-for-2023-says-wolff/10389941/, Lewis Hamilton came close to victory in Sundays United States Grand Prix aided in part by the final upgrade package of the season for the W13 car. The DNA of the car is going to change for next year thats clear said Wolff. But certainly what is part of the DNA of the car the architecture of the car will change for next year. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes W13 George Russell Mercedes W13 Photo by Mark Sutton  Motorsport ImagesHamilton said after the race that he thought Mercedes had taken a step in the right direction but noted Verstappens advantage on the straights. Mercedes will benefit from increased wind tunnel time for aerodynamic development in 2023 after Red Bull clinched the constructors championship on Sunday., Listen to this article Mercedes has just three races left to avoid its first winless season in 11 years after struggling to take the fight to Red Bull and Ferrari under the revised technical regulations for 2022. But the team has made decent progress over the season to get closer to the front runners. Lewis Hamilton came close to victory in Sundays United States Grand Prix aided in part by the final upgrade package of the season for the W13 car. He finished the race second after losing the lead with seven laps remaining. Mercedes has made clear that the update work it is doing late in the season is intended to help the direction of its car for 2023 which was set to change after finding issues with this years concept. The DNA of the car is going to change for next year thats clear said Wolff. It doesnt necessarily mean that our bodywork is going to look very different. But certainly what is part of the DNA of the car the architecture of the car will change for next year. Mercedes struggled in the early part of the season with a bouncing problem on the W13 car only to find a deeper issue that was baked into the design following its first major upgrade at the Spanish Grand Prix in May. The team has been unable to match the straightline speed of Red Bull over the year with the issue again becoming clear in Sundays race at the Circuit of The Americas when Max Verstappen eased past Hamilton for the lead of the race. Lewis Hamilton Mercedes W13 George Russell Mercedes W13 Photo by Mark Sutton  Motorsport Images Hamilton said after the race that he thought Mercedes had taken a step in the right direction but noted Verstappens advantage on the straights. I think under DRS theyre like 35 kmh faster than us he said. If were behind them were like 22k faster I think it is with DRS on the back straight. So he came from a long long way back. But even without the DRS I think theyre still something like 8 kmh up on us so weve got a lot of time being lost on the straight probably fourtenths at least a lap. And so weve got some improvements to make for next years car. Mercedes will benefit from increased wind tunnel time for aerodynamic development in 2023 after Red Bull clinched the constructors championship on Sunday. Should Mercedes remain third in the standings come the end of the season it would have 14 more wind tunnel running than Red Bull next year  something Wolff felt could offer a decent step. From that point it was a significant disadvantage so far because all of 2021 we were the leading team and then we won the constructors championship he explained. So all of the first half of 2022 we had 7 less wind tunnel time than the 18 months before of Red Bull and much less than Ferrari. Now it swings the other way around. Compared to Red Bull were going to have 14 more if we finish third so that over time is exactly what the regulations were designed for to give us the potential to eke the advantage out to claw it back.

A protest by Alonsos Alpine team against the decision to demote him out of the points after he finished seventh in a damaged car will be heard on Thursday. Alonso wrote on Instagram It is an important day for the sport as this decision will dictate if we are going in the right direction. Alonso said his post was in response to messages of support since the penalty. He thanked those who had contacted him on social media adding Its one of those rare times in sport that I feel we are all on the same page and share the same opinion towards rules and regulations. Alonso said after the race that he considered his drive one of the best of his career after he crashed at 180mph his car did a wheelie hit a wall he pitted for a new front wing resumed at the back and climbed to seventh despite damaged aerodynamic parts. The twotime champion has questioned the decisionmaking of officials on a number of occasions this year and his frustrations about the inconsistency of policing of action on track are shared by the majority of his fellow drivers. At the Spanish Grand Prix he accused the FIA of incompetence and lacking knowledge of racing. Criticism of the FIAs running of F1 has been a theme this year and the US Grand Prix was the race after the governing body angered drivers by allowing a recovery vehicle on track in conditions of poor visibility during heavy rain. Alpines appeal will be heard at 1800 Mexico City time 1200 BST on 27 October before this weekends Mexican Grand Prix. The team have questioned the US GP stewards decision to allow a protest by the Haas team despite it being posted after the permitted time limit had expired. The stewards said in their decision to hand Alonso a 30second penalty on Sunday that the Spaniards car was in an unsafe condition because he drove it for some time with a damaged wing mirror and then without one when it fell off. Haas pointed out their cars have previously been given the blackandorange warning flag  demanding a car is pitted for repairs  on three occasions in similar situations this season. At no point during the race were Alpine asked by officials to pit the car and remove the mirror despite calls from Haas to race control. The stewards ruling suggests that any car missing a rearview mirror after an incident will be forced to retire in future. There are also questions about the consistency of decisionmaking after stewards rejected a similar protest by Haas against Sergio Perezs Red Bull. Perez drove some laps with a damaged front wing part of which then fell off the car while he was running.
